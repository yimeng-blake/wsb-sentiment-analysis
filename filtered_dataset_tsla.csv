1/28/21 19:12,"WARNING & DD: S3 Partner Short Interest are NOT accurate! I've taken a look at S3 Partner's short interest data during my Tesla days and I've noted that they are wildly inaccurate. Please don't pay for this scam or reference this garbage.

**Evidence:**

Official short interest for GME is announced bi-monthly, and the latest number is at 61M shares in 1/15/21 [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote).

At no point during January did short interest from from S3 partners come close to 61M.

I had tried to use their short interest numbers as a real time reference for TSLA before in 2019, but then I realized later that they are bogus because they're complete off from the official TSLA short interest too.

Not a retard was selling, Not even a boomer chub,

The shares were held with hands of diamond, In hopes that DeepF\*ckingValue was right there behind them.

The wives were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of boyfriends danced in their heads,

And Dr. Patel on his Twitter, And Chamath on the news, Holding positions and anticipating the cruise,

When out on Wall Street there arose such a ruckus, We only held stronger, to keep them from fucking us,

Away from the earth, we will fly with a flash, Now up through the clouds, dreaming of cash.

The stars on the horizon beaming with glow, Gave the luster of the tendies we began with below,

When, what to my wondering eyes should the enemy appear, But many-a-short-sellers grinning ear to ear.

With their cocky positions, so crooked and wrong, I knew in that moment it must be Citron,

More 🌈 than a bear, just like 2008, They’ve come once again, here to manipulate,

With broadcasts and articles, screeching of fraud, They called for our takedown, but alas they were flawed.

“Now NIO! Now NOK! Now TSLA and AMC! On PLTR, On BBBY, On EXPR and BB!

To the top of the charts! To the top of my screen! There’s only way to go! Green! Green! Green!”

For now, we must be patient, But my fellow retards, I’ll leave you with this,

Tis not for the gains, nor for fame, But for those whom we will help in our Hero’s name,

Look at those short sellers and who they thought they could mock, Now all they hear is “we like the stock”,

The stories will be legendary, of the downfall of our enemy,

Me a couple fellow Duke students are working on a project to create an ETF for the WSB stocks. We have done a lot a research and talked to many of our professors to conclude that we need some capital for the project. I want to ask to see if you would be able to post the GoFundMe on the forum. It’s feasible and would monitor certain stocks like TSLA, NIO, GME, and more. The initial plan is to update the ETF every month to get peak performance.

With the recent news and backlash from media and hedge funds, we feel like now is the time to band together and create something that we can create a larger community by.

No CNBC, no Melvin Capital, no Robinhood can stop us from flying to mars and living in tendieland. No fuckin corrupt system can shut down trading and hinder us from getting our deserved riches!!!**

Hear me out here. I think Nano is going to make us all rich. It's what's  gonna get us all a Tesla, plus a second Tesla to launch to Jupiter and  beyond 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Altstreetbets, the crypto buddy of this holy sub, [is already dtf with this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/l66mhv/the_gme_case_for_nano/).

**# 1. What the f is Nano and why are you shilling this**

To  keep it short for us retards: Nano is a cryptocurrency that boasts zero  fees, instant transfers (sub-second), is green, and increases the size  of your pp. It has a good claim to being better than Bitcoin but has  1/1500th its market cap. [Daddy Elon tweeted about whatever has least error & latency will win](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704) \- that shit is literally what Nano is.

**# 2. We're in this together**

Apes  together strong, right? Nano has a huge community, so big that most of  the crypto subreddits aren't sure how to deal with the constant Nano  enthusiasm. Not kidding, the banned Nanites could fill a subreddit by  themselves. They're tireless on Reddit, Twitter, or anywhere else you  dare utter that you pay fees for any crypto or money transfer. These are  people that held through a 90% loss, then didn't sell when Nano  suddenly pumped 400%. Diamond hands doesn't even begin to describe it.  When the price pumped even slightly, they all jumped on it to pronounce  Nano the best thing since before sliced bread, and went to town on  Twitter and Reddit.

My point? **AMPLIFICATION**. As soon as Nano starts getting some price action, the Nanites will jump on it, will keep going, and they **ARE. NOT. LEAVING.**

**# 3. Rumours of Nano being suppressed**

The  rumour that Nano is being suppressed by crypto miners and Bitcoin  maximalists has been around for a very long time, and it makes sense.  Nano works ridiculously well, and is there to eat the cake of all the  miners who are raking in millions a day. BTC maxis and miners *hate*  the word Nano, and have a strong incentive to literally pay to have it  disappear from the face of the earth. Bitcoin influencers on Twitter  have muted the word Nano because they know their thesis is fucked when  it gets mentioned.

My point? **F EM**.  Bitcoin is king, Bitcoin was literally birthed by the virgin Mary, and  everything else is a 💩coin that doesn't deserve to pump. **F THAT**. And F maximalism in general. We're here to make money, and Bitcoin doesn't offer enough gains.

**# 4. Solid pumpamentals**

Aside  from the strong community and the ridiculously good tech, it also has  the other pumpamentals needed. It just got listed on AnchorUSD meaning  it's now easy to buy in the US, and was recently added to KuCoin for 10x  leveraged trading. Volume actively on the books on exchanges is low,  right now it would take only $600k to pump it 30% on Binance pair. What  else does it have as pumpamentals? The Nano team recently applied for  the Coinbase listing and Coinbase just so happens to have removed  pruning as a prerequisite from their website. Coincidence? Maybe, but  when asked earlier Nano's lack of pruning was mentioned as the obstacle  for a Coinbase listing. **COINS  GETTING LISTED ON COINBASE ALWAYS PUMP BECAUSE COINBASE HAPPENS TO BUY A  BUNCH OF WHATEVER THEY'RE LISTING BEFORE THEY LIST IT.**

Plus,  it seems like we would have Raoul Pal from Real Vision Group in our  camp. When he recently asked for altcoin recommendations the Nano  Twitter shills did their job as usual, he replied to them it was a good  thread. Coincidentally there was a huge (for Nano) buy order right  around that time.

More  pumpamentals? The Nano tagline writes itself. It transfers in the blink  of an eye, it has no fees, it's greener than the big dildo that's  currently fucking Melvin Capital, has the best wallet in all of crypto  and can be demonstrated to anyone within a minute. It's the ultimate  antidote to the high fees narrative of Bitcorn, and shames institutions  for holding a CO2 emitting coal guzzler on their balance sheets through  Bitcorn. As soon as the price starts going up, this thing sells itself.  Hell, institutions can even buy it since recently through Bitcoin  Suisse, where Nano was added because of demand. And keep in mind - this  has a market cap of $450 million. Throwing $100 at Nano does more than  throwing $1000 at AMC.

My point? Well, exactly the title. **SOLID PUMPAMENTALS**. Seriously this thing is so ready to be hyped.

**# 5. The plan**

Am  I saying to leverage this x100 to pump it into the skies? Maybe, but  also no. I am saying that whatever you do, Nano is going to pump anyway  because if us retards can figure it out, others can too. This shit can  be 10x leveraged on KuCoin without even needing to do KYC. I'm doing  that right now, and am expecting you all to do the same. At a 3000% gain  ($100) we can call this a success, if it gets to $250 I'll buy the top  comment on this post a Tesla because fuck it, I'll be rich.

**My credentials?**  My post karma when I posted this on another sub was 420. Due to the  mass upvotes my total karma has now increased to 1337. I'm counting on  this post shooting me to 42069. Need I say more?

Positivity,  not disagreeing with anything I've said and more examples of solid  pumpamentals (also places to leverage it more than 10x) are welcome in  the comments ⬇

PROOF OR BAN [https://i.imgur.com/9eHQw6K.png](https://i.imgur.com/9eHQw6K.png)

Edit: **how to buy this shit?**  Binance (5x leverage), Kucoin (10x leverage, can send crypto from other  exchanges there and 10x leverage without KYC), or Kraken. If you got  other crypto already, there's changenow. For Europe, Bitvavo is best.

Edit:  Seems this shit is working, I'm currently up 80%. Don't worry, I'm not  selling until this shit hits at least $250 so I can buy the top comment  his Tesla.",4926,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.997338235,True
1/29/21 01:23,"Well here's my take y'all Hey guys, not sure if this is going to make it through the modblocker but here goes. Long as \*\*\*\* I know but bear with me. Censored so we can play by someone else's game. 

Long time lurker, didn’t make a reddit account until like 3 days ago because I am an introvert and never participate in this community, only doom-scrolled endlessly for years with hearty belly laughs. I found WSB after a confusing 2018 and shedding tears wearing a ratty flannel inside a Model S in a Tesla showroom. Needless to say, I've since upgraded to the H&M sales rack. 

So, I, like a lot of you, was a kid during 2008. My parents had a business in a booming market whose success led them to buy a house; they got absolutely crushed and it marked the end of their relationship and a string of hopelessness that is etched into my mind. 

Well, I wound up choosing the camo pajama path for a few years for free college. This post mainly applies to Americans I guess, because this is our system, and we're promised inalienable rights through our Constitution and the Free Market line-of-thought and such. 

1)  The people of this country are awesome. People wearing camo pajamas for a living gave me a wide knowledge of how fabulous and great the average guy/gal is here. Integrity is top-notch amongst those who came from modest backgrounds. If you don’t come from the USA, I would understand this statement would be confusing, especially after what happened on the 6th of JAN. I have to tell you, I was exposed to the wealthy and the non, and damn. The power of manipulation the mighty dollar holds is completely underestimated. 

2)  The people of this community are from modest backgrounds. They live day-to-day jobs. They don’t go baller with their earnings. If they ‘lose it all’, they remain the same. I personally will remain in my small apartment. I tried taking earnings yesterday and celebrating with a $50 dish from a fancy restaurant, but having to deal with the surrounding people and food wasn’t worth the price. And man, every table of richies was talking about this forum. 

3)  This is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. And it shall not perish from the earth. Gettysburg address, Lincoln. Here’s the deal, for all you onlookers who are truly curious about what is happening. Red Pill Blue Pill time. Every piece of news you are ever told ever is now controlled by billionaires who have a vested purpose of convincing you of something. Watching that interview on CNBC with Chamath Palihapatiya yesterday shook me to my core; when he started talking about when we were kids, it struck a tone. He’s right. Sentiment is there. This forum is by far the most intelligent, most interesting, most amazing thing I’ve ever had the opportunity to be a part of, and I never even participated. 

4)  The truth is, the people that have been in WSB for years have been continuously \*\*\*\*\*\* with by Wall Street. Intentional massive swings in price to strip money from these guys in Options, and if you don’t understand what I’m talking about, just trust me. These guys have been (capital) \*\*\*\*\*\* (capital) by Wall Street over and over again. We all, collectively, live in their game. They control video media, they control print media, they control financial media. Every piece is a hit piece. Trust me on this. Trust WSB on this. They are not trying to protect us. Never have, never will.

5)  To our politicians on so-called Free-Market economics. What you are witnessing is a true expression of a truly free capitalist market. A bunch of traders find intrinsic value in a stock and by all and every account of the rules that we claim to have adopted in this country, can and are allowed to continue. You should take ALL and EVERY call to stop this with utmost scrutiny. If you truly represent us Americans, you need to open your eyes and have an open mind. This event is literally the beginning of the scene in Wizard of Oz, where we are slowly peaking behind the curtain. Income inequality is real. Wall Street manipulates Americans to meet their objectives. This is fact- not opinion. The eyes of the world are literally upon you. If we had this situation in the 60's and it was squelched by our government, you can bet your sweet \*\*\* that there would be communist propaganda stating capitalism was a lie to benefit the fat cats. 

EVERY. SINGLE. RED BLOODED AMERICAN. Is following this right now. I would argue the vast majority of them are rooting for WSB, the little guy, for once. 

6)  To our politicians on the people here. The vast majority of people here are generous, kind, and caring people. They care about their communities, they care about more than “economy”. As mentioned before, they know no bail-out. Never have. Another thing- and AOC this is for you. Fight for us here. WE WILL PAY ALL TAXES ON GAINS AS PER OUR TAX BRACKET. The people are watching. A free-market economy will work well when we all can play together. 

7)  This group of traders calls themselves “idiots”. They understand the system is rigged. They are trying to fight back in an intellectual manner. Unfortunately, if income inequality continues unmitigated and you don’t fight for us, I've got a feeling that the people that come to fight next will not be the same group. They will not understand why they’re struggling, they just are. They will not know or understand the mechanics of the markets, finance, or wealth. They will not call themselves “idiots”, and they’re going to be spurred by much worse chat-boards in much worse corners of the internet. Surely, on 6JAN, if you went over to your average joe, there’s no way in hell they considered themselves ‘stupid’. 

8)  I’m begging you. Fight for our democracy. Fight for a free market. Fight for the right to party. Fight to equate the system. Fight for free access to unbiased information for all traders. Fight for neutral media. Fight to keep people from being controlled. Please. If you don’t do anything to keep billionaires from destroying us over and over again, Capitalism as we know it is at stake. Movements will become more radical. This will not be a one-off thing in our country. Keep in mind, thousands of our countrymen/women have died fighting to preserve capitalism and free trade throughout the world. To be ""protecting"" investors like this is to not rationalize our nation's previous conflicts. To keep this system the way it is currently, and to allow blatant market manipulation to continue in this country is to not have a damn clue what we are all about. This is a democracy, through and through. Be leaders. LEAD THIS SHIT. 

9)  I believe very strongly in capitalism and a free market. What you’re seeing is income equalization in a free market before your very eyes. It required no government hand-holding. It required no extra taxes or bureaucracy. It required no thought by anyone in government. It required no legislation. It did, however, require a lot of thought and due-diligence by some amazingly intelligent people who did so on a free public forum for the benefit of all. This is the true merit of capitalism, and every single American that claims to love our system and our way of life needs to know- you're witnessing the cracking of the facade occur before your very eyes. We’ve been tricked for so long to think that we’re living in a truly free capitalist market. We’re not. They own the tools, they own the information, and they own the capital. We’re playing someone else’s game. Always have, always will. Don’t believe what you hear. Think for yourselves. We are players in THEIR game.

&#x200B;

So I encourage you guys to look into SLV. There's a massive squeeze on this, not to mention an OBVIOUS LACK OF PHYSICAL BACKING, and blatant High Frequency Trading. If we pop the price above 30 then it becomes a two fold issue. Blackrock and JP Morgan run this show, Blackrock is the hedge fund, and JP Morgan is the bank shorting ETF and Long on physical. I've been working on this for about 6 months, and sunk North of 15k into requesting the physical silver. If we can drain the supply and/or force them to lose control of the SLV manipulation like they lost control of Rhodium futures ($20,000 per troy oz) then it's game over. 

&#x200B;

Technically speaking, if there's a drain on the physical supply then you guys become the squeezers on not on the banks, but ALL INDUSTRY USE. Cellphones, computers, solar panels, and any electronics need (Can you say TESLA Buying Silver for their cars....?) 

&#x200B;

All of this kept in mind, along with JPOW running that printer non-stop and the stimulus. The pressure in SLV is set to break the space-time barrier once it's restraints are dissolved. 

&#x200B;

If you guys pop the price above 30, and the physical requests keep rolling in the damage will be biblical. Between the covering of the shorts and being forced to buy physical silver will ruin them. 

&#x200B;

Just my two cents. Silver has ruined many banks before in the past, but if you guys use this same strategy.... it will be Jericho's walls.

If you think that Gamestop went parabolic, SLV had the potential to hit Andromeda Galaxy.

The rocket we've ridden for the last few days had helped some us us take care of those we love. But it seems like the rocket has run out of fuel. So I have found another opportunity that could change lives forever. Some of you may already know about it but regardless I'm going to talk about it because I truly believe in it. It's called Crispr. It's a genetic editing technology with massive potential. Imagine all the hereditary diseases and health issues that may exist in your family. Alzheimer's, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, all manner of cancers of syndromes. Crispr has the capability to remove those things from your children and the children that follow at the genetic level. Crispr scientists received a Nobel Prize earlier this year for their work. About 4 months ago, they treated a few individuals suffering from sickle cell disease. Those people now live virtually symptom free. Every time Crispr Therapeutics(CRSP) puts out a press release, it's good news, and this pumps up their stock price dramatically. They peaked somewhere around the $210 per share mark a few weeks ago and have corrected down to $170 per share in the last 2 days. The crazy part is that this is a publicly traded company that has no products on the market. They're operating at a loss, similarly to the way Tesla and Amazon were in recent years. The moment those two companys posted any profits, their share price flew through the roof to the moon. I dont see why Crispr Therapeutics(CRSP) would be any different. I would paste links to news articles, press releases, and research data, but there is so much out there about that I don't feel the need to. See for yourselves.

&#x200B;

**Brokers Stay Locked Down Indefinitely:**

This is basically the only scenario I see Wall Street winning in. In this case they slowly buy up shares while eliminating any external buying pressure and reducing the market to low volume selling pressure.

&#x200B;

I find this to be rather unlikely due to the utter shitstorm of a response brokers received yesterday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Everyone Holds Indefinitely**

Very similar scenario to above but we all hold until brokers are forced to return to normalcy. Shorts burn billions a day. Eventually they cave. We win.

&#x200B;

Idk how likely this is. Prisoner's Dilemma and all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Brokers Fix Their Shit Soon**

If brokers fix their shit and return to normal there will be a huge influx of buying launching the price to the moon. Shorts will have to cover. We win

&#x200B;

This is the ideal scenario and arguably the most likely given regulatory pressure.

&#x200B;

**Some Combination of the Above**

With some combination of the above where we limit selling pressure and brokers slowly return to normalcy while shorts continue doubling down we may see a long, drawn out Tesla-like squeeze.

1/31/21 05:34,"GME is actually criminally undervalued and is poised to be the next trillion dollar company. Mods: Please don’t delete, hear me out

TLDR: GameStop’s long-term success is not a meme. They are actually poised to be the next trillion-dollar company. They are still highly undervalued despite the risk. 

Long Rant: I am not a financial advisor. I’m just a simple ape that wants a better future for us all.

I started investing in my early 20’s back in 2011. I’ve actually avoided wallstreetbets for a long time because YOLO and loss porn were never my cup of tea. But somewhere along the way you all grew up. You found out the difference between gambling and investing. You see, I’ve always been of the opinion that any type of short-term strategy is gambling when it comes to buying or selling stock. Markets are susceptible to wild fluctuation and you are a fool if you think you can time the market for a perfect quick flip. I’ve avoided options and have never taken a short position because I understand just how risky they can be, exposing yourself to potentially unlimited losses is something only the stupidest people are willing to do and they do not deserve to call themselves investors. To be an investor there is only one true strategy and that is buy and HOLD!!!!!!

I remember back in 2012 I read an article about a little-known company at the time called Tesla Motors. They had just announced their model S and I really liked that company. So I bought some shares which at the time cost my $27 each. I held those shares and I waited until model S deliveries started arriving on doorsteps. I waited until charging stations cropped up all over the country. I waited until they announced gigafactories and energy storage. And in 2015 I sold my shares for about $270 per share. I remember bragging about my gains at the time like a paper handed little bitch. 

I don’t brag about that anymore. If I would have held on to those shares my life would be in a completely different place now financially. This was one of the hardest lessons I’ve ever learned as an investor and I don’t intend on making it again.

Enough about me, let me tell you why GME is the next trillion-dollar company and why I’m holding my measly 15 shares at $298 until I pass them down to my daughter in my will.

First, let me talk about the power of a brand by looking at a company like Apple. In 2001 Apple was also at an all time low. Considered to be a failing company at the time they released a new mp3 layer called the ipod which gained them tremendous appeal amongst a younger generation of customers. Since then Apple has spent billions of dollars per year in marketing and product placements to maintain mass appeal for their brand among young people which are the most difficult demographic to market to. Apple today is worth $2 trillion dollars as a company. And you know what?!

I don’t like Apple. They make overpriced hardware and with overly restrictive software and use subliminal brainwashing tactics to trick you into buying their crappy products.

But Gamestop? I really like Gamestop, here’s why.

Gamestop, much like Apple in 2001 doesn’t look like much on paper, but none of that matters. Because, without spending a single dollar, overnight, GME has become the most beloved brand among younger people. That is incredibly powerful. Never before have so many individuals been this enthusiastically invested in the long-term success of any company.

GameStop has gotten massive amounts of free PR and had undying loyalty from millions of individuals that are not only investors, but customers as well. This whole movement is being driven by GameStop’s loyal customer base. This is monumental!!!

If I were GameStop’s CEO I would be so giddy right now. Their company has been adopted by the wsb community. It is our child. I would never sell my child. There is no price high enough to sacrifice my own children. GameStop is poised for a very bright future because there isn’t a single new product or pivot that this loyal, undying customer and investor base won’t be on board with. New streaming service? Esports league? Eggs? I don’t care, I’m buying it.

I keep hearing all this bullshit from boomers who think they are experts, and they keep saying GameStop isn’t worth their current price. This is Bullshit! They are lying to put fear into you. GameStop is actually worth so much more! $1,000 per share is not a meme, $10,000 per share is not a meme. In twenty years GameStop will be worth more than Apple, Google, and Amazon combined. Why? Because it is OUR company, not their company. We just bought it, it’s ours and we will make sure it is the best one!

Do not be a paper handed fool that falls for all the bullshit fear from media sources and idiots who are in the pockets of hedge funds and short term gamblers. That’s all they are. Morons who would’ve bet against Apple in 2001. 

Diamond hands is not a meme either. It is the simplest and most legitimate form of investing. Buying a stock that you like and holding it until you retire is exactly how you become a millionaire. It’s a strategy that’s good enough for Warren Buffet and it’s good enough for us. Think of all the paper handed pussies that sold Apple in 2001. Is that what you want this to be? The time you made a small buck quickly and missed out on true long-term wealth?

As far as I’m concerned there is only one thing that GME can do to mess this up. And that is to turn against us. Don’t dilute shares, don’t bail out the short sellers that were so eager to shutter your doors and ruin your business. We believe in you and will support you so don’t let us down.

As long as GameStop is loyal to us, the investors. Their future is very bright. Any industry or pivot they would like to pursue is immediately theirs because they have our undying support.

Amazon, Google, Apple… I don’t like them. But GameStop? I really really like them a lot. I don’t want a Gmail any more, let me get a GameStop mail. I don’t want prime any more, I want GameStop! I don’t want an iPhone, I want GameStop!

1/30/21 17:29,"DD on the future of the market and why I am switching to a gay bear 🌈🐻 #Preface
Holding $250k 🚀GME🚀 [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES). I was a permabull until I hit the submit button on this post

Now that I got your limited autistic attention with the troll-baiting title. Now that I’ve won you over to my side with my retarded fucking yolo position on 🚀GME🚀, I am going to share with you my prediction on stock market as a whole for the next six months. 

#TLDR
Hold 🚀GME🚀 until Citadel is dead. Puts on anything a few months after that. Wall street will win in the end but I’ll come out on top.

#Where we are today
It’s not hard to argue that we are in a large bubble of epic proportions. We had COVIND shut down the world economy and less than 1 year later the SPY is trading up 65% from the bottom. Meanwhile we have tech stocks like TSLA up over 500%. I don’t think this is sustainable and we are overdue for a bear market. 

“Okay, so what will happen?”
Good question!

#What will happen
##Short Term (1-4 weeks)
This 🚀GME🚀 short squeeze is going to trigger, and it will trigger soon. Once the short sellers get margin called the price of 🚀GME🚀 is going to rocket up to incomprehensible levels. (I’m holding till $69,420) Some hedge funds will die out, maybe we kill off a broker. Who knows, maybe a too bank if we’re lucky. The retail investors will get a win and the overall stock market will be okay.  At $10,000/share the market cap is only $700 billion. This is a lot to us, but not enough to actually impact wall street.
Maybe 🚀GME🚀 is just the start and wsb starts buying up other over shorted meme stocks. I don’t know, but i wouldn't bet that wall street will let us get more than one win in-a-row.  

Once the 🚀GME🚀 squeeze is squoze we move on to the mid term.

##Mid Term (1-3 months)
In the case of 🚀GME🚀 retail won and hedge funds lost. Wall Street doesn’t like losing and now they know that we can hold them by the balls and start a short squeeze on other stocks with infinite risk involved to the hedge funds.  
For example, If the short float ratio for a stock is 70% and wsb goes in and buys up 40% of the shares holding them in diamond hands, guess what happens. We artificially limit the float causing a short ratio of more than 100%. 
The hedge funds will see this coming and start to off load their shorts before they get stuck in another short squeeze. 

While this is happening the hedge funds will be buying back stocks at an increasing price. Since retail won with 🚀GME🚀, and now that they have all this new money with a risk tolerance of a mentally disabled gorilla, they will start buying up all these stocks little the dumb kids they are. It’s going to look like retail is about to start another new type of bubble that will last forever. A bubble built on the speculation that meme stocks will short squeeze again and again. A **squebble™** if you will. Really what is happening is that the hedge funds are exiting their short positions and taking the loss before another squeeze starts. We will know this is happening if the over shorted meme-stocks start raising in price while the short shares start declining. This brings us to the third and final term. 

##Long term (4 - 8 months)
Okay quick recap: 
We’re in a bubble
hedge funds are closing shorts
retail is buying up everything. 

This is going to be the end of short selling to this extreme. Not because of regulations, or fines, or prison time, but because we now have the power to abuse the system against them. Hedge funds or brokers won’t allow this type of overeverage from happening again. Since short selling is a very profitable tactic that is now off the table, the value added in from the margin trades will diminish and the stock market is going to decrease in value. Hedge funds will see the writing on the wall and start to move into safe investments. Maybe they go into cash, maybe into gold, I don’t know. I’m just a 25 year old engineer who doesn’t really know shit about the stock market or where money flows to in a bear market. 

#End game
Still here? Great! Follow me to the epic conclusion of this 2 page novel. 
Hedge funds are moving money into safe investments before the impending bear market. Retail, however, is still high on life like a fucking dipwad huffing paint buying up everyhting under the sun. Pretty soon the hedges and retail will stop buying because of exhaustion (It literally can’t go up forever, sorry bulls 🤡)  We all saw what happens when there is no one to buy a stock thanks to Robinhood removing the buy button. In this case it will be because no one will buy since everything is way too overvalued. **This is when everything comes tumbling down.** It will start with the risky meme and tech stocks since those are what wallstreet will exit from first. Then it will cascade into everything else. 

We are about to witness a bubble pop larger than anything ever before. This time the game has been changed against wall street and only an epic bear market will remove retail from the big kids table once again.

1/30/21 16:45,"What's happening is great, but don't let the media's narrative draw attention away from the Wall Street greed that ACTUALLY started this TL;DR at the end for the retards who didn't pass third grade 

So most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk-tolerant self-proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and ""screw the hedge funds"" because we were ""bored at home"" with stimulus checks or whatever fuck else. Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story. After all we hype around shit all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?


#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.


If this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**


This was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.


Eventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just ""fuck the shorts"". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.

This info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord & Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one ""holding the line"". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.

Obviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares & options to the fucking andromeda galaxy🚀🚀🚀🚀

But please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.

TL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.

Just like Tesla that almost went under, it got an almost cult-like following, people are rooting for it to win against the big guys, and succeeding at that. 

Both are about something that the boomers in suits don't understand so they try to shut it down to keep the status quo(electric card, e-gaming, ecommerce) and the everyday retail investors are buying, rich people are buying and giving it more attention online, this is just starting to gain traction, next week will be nuts.

even after the supposed squeeze, the price will most likely stay relatively high, and the company will be relevant for a long time, even if wall street tries to intentionally shut it down again, it won't happen again, so this is good. deepfuckingvalue might actually have saved a company and changed many ordinary people's lives without knowing it

1/30/21 15:11,"For those concerned about rumors of shorts having covered, or that they managed to close out lower positions but open new ones - don't be worried! Okay - regarding short positions. Over the last couple days of fuckery, it's entirely possible the shorts have managed to close out of their very lowest postions and re-entered new ones higher up. It's possible original shorts have abandoned the game, but new players have entered. We have no way of knowing the position of the short, just that there is one. It's possible certain places have covered their shorts. But that doesn't matter. Don't let that get in your head.

What matters is the short interest %, and by any account, that has either flatlined, gone down only the slightest amount, or even gotten larger. That is the key. They haven't backed down. Maybe shuffled the chairs on the deck of the titanic, but still steering straight for the iceberg. 

I'll use Tesla as an example. You know how shorts lost billions against them? Well, it wasn't because of a short squeeze, it's because people kept buying and holding and buying and shorts kept leapfrogging their positions thinking it *had* to go down. It hasn't. What we've seen the past two weeks is simply two years of the Tesla battle vs shorts played out in fast forward. 

It's simple math at this point. Regardless of current price or point where they entered their position, shorts have to pay interest. It costs nothing to hold. 

It might not be a violent squeeze like VW 2008, but until those fuckers back off trying to short this to excess levels and the short interest % comes down, it's a steady march to five digits.",17972,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.901709497,True

GME squeezing will cause a 20-30% market correction as the liquidity necessary to cover all the short positions is obtained by selling off other positions in the market. The only day this week that the indexes closed higher than they opened was the day where Robinhoes restricted trading, because on the other days short sellers had to meet their growing margin requirements by selling other stocks. This, coming just after Tesla's earnings miss and the fact that it's a major component of the S&P 500 AND is considered to be a huge bubble by institutions, will literally drive Tesla stock into the dirt. Unfairly, mind you, because my price target for them is still $1600. Frankly, that target is conservative.

But.

These other tickers that are being harpooned into space are not without cause. Why are they being harpooned?

Because we LIKE these companies.

Because these companies have been beaten down during COVID or the current tech onslaught.

And...because they are not OVERVALUED.

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix, etc. are at or near ALL TIME HIGHS. Their ongoing innovation is by buying up companies like GME to put under their umbrella.

Now we're coming out of the pandemic. Gamestop has new leadership. The whole world is watching and millions of retards are buying in anger.

Back in September when I made my first investment, I lost about $50 x 100 shares. Bought TSLA at 440 and sold out at 390 with paper hands and panic selling. Look at its stock price now.

After that, I vowed to myself I would never sell stock again. I needed a strategy. Something that would help me pull through psychologically and hold. At that time, as well, the NIO rocket ship was still boarding to the moon. I bought in at $27. Although the ship was mid-flight, something halted it at $49-$50. I was scared shitless. I thought that it was done for now. The increasing amount of stress I had, thinking about the stock price day in and day out (especially on weekends), began eating away at my mind. It was at that time that ***I had suddenly began to jack off about 3 times a day*** (it used to only be once a day). Once at the beginning of premarket, once at market open, and once at market closing (the intervals because of the refractory period... or... rest period, should I say). Without even realizing it, I had spent less time on trading charts and more time on \[awesome websites\] to optimize my ""sessions"". It was great. And before I knew it, I held right through to NIO day where, and now NIO stands at $57.

Holding can be beneficial. And there are multiple examples of such other than NIO and TSLA. And many other individuals in this subreddit can testify to that (DFV, SIR JACKALOT). Whether or not they utilized the same strategy as me, I'm not sure. Regardless, this outlines the importance of holding and what I did to hold.

2/1/21 11:04,"Why WSB is now running the entire equity market pt.2 - Investment Professional here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.",19490,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999585688,True

2/1/21 00:14,"GME share price moving forward after the shorts squozed Hi all, im providing my opinion on the subject matter as i have been hearing chatter about share prices crashing back to $4 or $20 once the squoze is over.

I am of the opinion this will not happen as we need to look at companies which successfully battled Shorters as reference- best one is Tesla TSLA:

a. We all know why GME price 🚀, due to gamma squeeze from calls, buying of stocks and shorts covering - all these led to stocks being bought from float. So less supply and more demand = price go up bigly

b. Important to remember who are the parties benefiting from 🚀 - retail, whales and institutions who long shares and calls, and GME insiders

c. The manipulative actions of brokers to limit share buying by retail - share buy limit 1 - 5 shares and increasing margin to 100%, these are actually good for holders. Why you ask? Because that means retail buyers who have 100% cash to back their holdings can hold onto these shares without worry about having stop losses or increase margin requirements.

So with these 3 points once share price rocket and settled (assuming at $1000 to 1200), there will be some selling to recognise profits. But the price will not crater because simple reason, at that price GME has the capital to reinvent their biz - means more incentive for whales and institutions to hold as a value stock. Retail will mostly likely hold.

When selling takes place it will also be controlled, because people are not selling to get out of a sinking ship, but to make a profit. Look at TSLA do you see its price cratering because holders are dumping desperately? Buyers who got in later this week bought the shares between $200 to $300 on average, there is no reason to sell at massive loss once price 🚀

   If you think about predatory short-selling and it's effects on the economy, it is a practice that removes value from the our economic system. Imagine all the new companies that, if given a legitimate chance to grow, may have produced huge value for the entire economy. Imagine if Melvin Capital had been successful with Tesla in that regard? The effects of putting off the EV revolution and our general move away from fossil fuels could have been disastrous. Not to mention the fact that the Cybertruck is gonna be cool as fuck and the world would be a bit sadder without it. The damage they have done already is incalculable.

2/2/21 15:37,"Why lithium is biggest Play in the coming next few weeks. $LAC Stonk can give you BIGGEST gains! Everyone in biden administration wants to be long on the Climate therefore lots of subsidies and hype is to go long on EV and solar. The biggest EV automaker is TESLA. Tesla is huge in demand, its factories is set up in Nevada. They all LITHIUM to power their cars up.

$LAC lithium americas corp just got approval from govt for lithium mining in Thacker Pass. Thacker pass has the most lithium deposit in USA and its located in nevada and its merely only 200 miles away from Tesla factories. $LAC already mining lithium in the Argentina and few other places so they are already know what they are doing and own thacker pass location in Nevada.

They are projected to start mining lithium in January 2022 and construction is almost complete as much as 60 percent. They are now signing. parnerships which are under NDA and I reckon one of the partnerships is TESLA and other big automakers such as GM, Ford, Toyota etc.

Currently we dont have biggest lithium miners in US, so in order to rise big in this revolution, US govt is helping $LAC and probabaly $LAC being the biggest lithium miner in US is a great thing for its economy and its automakers economy. Lithium americas currently raised 400 million dollars at average price of $22, currently its trading under that, so its a discount for you, but it wont stay longer. Once the partnerships are announced, it will rise big, now is the time to buy and hold.

Lithium is the new oil, This is easily can go 40s --> 50s --> 60 ---> after the launch easily can be trading may be even north of 100s. If your grandfather or dad missed on OIL investment, this is the best thing up and running now, so now is the time to give a second look. Check out $LAC.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Math Time:** In thinking about value, we hppen to enjoy simple convenience of a Nice Round Number. 101 million shares Outstanding. A $2 billion Market cap (almost exactly) $20 per share, $3 billion @ $30 per share and so on OR $40 per share to reach 4 bilion market cap. To ask ""is it possible $LAC could hit $40??????? ---> is to ask , could market could ever hit $4 billion.

In assesing value more specically, we can also enjoy the simplicity of approaching the company as sum of its part on two primary assets: 49 % interest in the Causchari-Olaroz brine project in Jujuy Province, Argentina (""CO"") AND a 100 % Interest in the Thacker Pass project in Nevada USA (""TP"")

Construction of CP is over 60 % COMPLETE already, and fully capitalized. Construction will complete Q4 2021, AND Lithium Production will begin Q1 January 2022 (11 months from now) at 2 Million Tons proven and probable reserve of battery grade lithium in Carbonate equivalent (""LCE""). Production capacity of 40,000 tons per annum (""TPA""). Operating cost of $3.579/Ton. A 40 year project Life.

Construction of TP, of course, has not started but underlying resource is well documented. 3.1 Million tons of LCE proven and probable. Production Capacity of 60,000 tpa. Operating Cost of Around $4,000/Ton. A 46 year project life.

Conservatively 80,000 Tpa of LCE X $12Lk/ton (LAC's assumed avg price) = $ 960 Million revenue minus $4k/ton (high end of cost of production) = $640 million EBITDA. But in my opinion, thats too LOW. We are on precipice of unprecedented surge in worldwide demand for LCE. Experts say Demand will in crease 10x IN Ten years, Some are saying 6x demand will increase by 2024 alone. LEC prices have already risen 50 % in 6 months but are still very depressed. If LCE recovers just to 2018 levels ($25k/Ton): 80k Tpax$25k/ton= 2.0 Billion revenue, $1.6 billion EBITDA.

As for what multiple should apply to these figures, your guess is as good as mine. For illustration, ALB boasts $ 3.34 Billion revenue, $853 EBITDA, A $19.18 billion Market Cap, fetching a trailing price/sales of 5.91, SQM has 1.78 billion revenue, $572 m EBITDA, a $14.87 billion Market cap, fetching a P/S 8.37. May be $LAC is lower, or higher, or somewhere in between. i leave it greater minds of Fellows here than my own mind to Project.

But if (1) despite Surging demand LCE Spot prices never rise a penny above $12k/ton and (2) we apply a very low 5x sales ration, fair value of LAC could be $4.8 billion , i.e $48/share. If LCE price recover to 2018 elvels we keep the same low 5x sales ratio fair price for LAC could be 10 billion, i.e $100/share. iF lac Fetches the same multiple as SQM (8.37 x sales) we get $16.74 Billion i.e $167/share.

2/2/21 11:43,"Why $VALE (Vale SA) is a buy. $VALE is a mining company (one of the largest in the world. They specialize in mining Iron Ore, Nickel, Manganese, Coal, and Copper. It has huge upside with the potential to 10x at a moment's notice.

20% of Analysts rank it as a Strong Buy

80% of Analysts rank it as a Buy

However, the price targets are not the high, why? They have been fined 2 billion dollars by the Brazilian government over a collapsed dam, but that doesn't really matter in the short term does it.

$VALE produces Nickel and Copper which are fundamental to battery production, and it just so happens there is a worldwide shortage on Nickel which is fundamental to battery production. The EV market continues to expand, and with continued growth more and more nickel is needed to meet demand.

So why the huge upside potential?

One Answer: Papa Elon

Elon Musk has said a number of times that Tesla will give sustainable mining companies a large agreement. I believe that the time for a large Tesla contract is soon, and VALE in my opinion is most likely to receive the contract. If this were to happen I would not doubt a price jump of 10x immediately to fall and stay steady at 5x at around $80-$100 a share similar evaluation to $CAT in the short term, and if battery production continues at exponential growth I could this becoming a trillion dollar company by 2030.

GameStop had one of the craziest rallies of all time, $2.57 last summer to $500. The popular opinion is “hedge funds manipulating the price down” right? Well GameStop is down 65% from the peak last week, and a lot of you will baghold to the ground. Here’s the simplest explanation: Initial short squeeze blew up several funds (RIP Melvin), guys who got in early used the hype as an exit opportunity, new shorts entered near the peak, and the 5 million new kids here listened to Dave Portnoy and bought the top bc diamond handz. 

It’s not manipulation when a stock that ran up 2000% in a week pulls back, it’s mean reversion. The manipulation was what we did pushing it all the way to $500 and wrecking shop on the way. 

“But the VW chart from 09!” This isn’t VW. Porsche cornered VW shares by itself and refused to sell. They controlled that squeeze single handedly. There have been 100M shares trading daily, you really think everyone here is actually holding? If they were the price never would have dropped back below $400. Smart money took profits and everyone else is holding out of hope. Hopium is a dangerous drug.

How did you think this would end? Obviously profit taking would come eventually, and it looks like it hit at $500. Posting a screenshot of your 5 shares and a 💎✋🏼 meme won’t hold the price up forever. The real winners got in early and took profits as the media caught on.

For those that feel the pressure of being down 70% on whatever value you put in, you bought into a movement that is shining the largest spotlight on a long standing problem. We are in the part of the movie where even long time, fair play market professionals are finding that corruption really has infiltrated every facet of the process. The business of short selling is to feed on death. You make sure you’re in the will, and then you go to work on killing Grandma. The practice has ruined a lot of business hopes, but no one is there to protect Grandma anymore. Even the night shift watch gets a payout. But they over reached this time and someone noticed. A junior player said, why even hide what we do, there is no stopping it, and literally started injecting Grandma right in the middle of the community game time. And they got asked, ‘hey, what’s in the needle?  Are you a doctor?’

There may be a significant loss between 60% and 90%, but you did join the rare opportunity to join a community outcry to require a hard look, and hopefully a correction to an industry that once again is out of control. Hopefully that means something to you. 

I’m thankful that my money was already in position.

I learned I liked some digital currencies I can’t mention and got in with what funds I could back in September as they started to climb.  They treated me well.

You really only have 3 options at this point:

1. Make money
2. Make a ton of money
3. Lose money

So how do these 3 come into play?

1. HOLD.  If you hold the shares you currently have, we will climb back up and you will have your tendies.  The squeeze is coming.  The hedgies are beyond fuk right now.  Hold, and sell at $10k.  This was always the plan and still is.
2. HOLD and AVERAGE DOWN.  You already know you're going to make money because the hedgies are fuk.  Want to make more?  Lower your cost basis!  If you bought in at $300, right now the stock is cheap as hell.  If you bought 10 @ $300, and buy another 20 @ $120, your cost basis has now dropped to $180.  In addition, you have now have 30 stocks in total, further fuk'ing the hedgies.  This is the smart play.  The people who will be driving Teslas to Valhalla dripping dip sauce all over themselves while eating tendies are doing this.
3. Be a paperhanded bitch and sell cuz you're scared.  You lose money and have no hope of profiting off the hedgies being fuk.  You lose a ton of karma and WSB calls you a poonanny for the rest of your life.  You will eventually see the massive amounts of profit everyone else takes and you will cry.

To all of you who are out there who’ve ever thought “oh man, if I’d only bought X stock X years ago I’d be rich!” - if you aren’t holding right now, you’re wrong. 

I’m an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn’t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I’m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it’s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin’s mistake? No actual hedging. Don’t be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won’t help if you’re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I’ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don’t give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren’t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It’s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we’re in dire straits probably didn’t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold.

After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.

So that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead.

2/4/21 00:41,"SSYS - Stratasys flying under the radar Oraight, time for some deep dive.

You all heard about that Kathie Wood, sister to Tiger Woods and Woodie Woodpecker. ARKK (her investment firm), identified TSLA early as a potentially exponential company. Ever since the TSLA stock split, I have been going through ARKKs ETF exposure and been looking into further firms that have an angle.

I have been looking into three areas of ARKK:

* EV
* Genomics
* Technological Advancements

While the first two are clear and there should be some exposure to it in your portfolios or bets, I was specifically interested in the third category.

**Introducing Stratasys SSYS**

The company has quite a solid foundation. It is one of the leading 3D-printing companies. Makerbot? The biggest brand in 3D Printing? Yep, Stratasys. I come from a background where 3D printing has become the absolute industry standard and we are going to see it becoming the standard in mass manufacture, too. I am speaking metal and carbon 3d-printing. Let me tell you, carbon printing is already better than part molding and every company on earth is starting to use it. I am talking car manufacturers, shipyards, small-scale prototypers, the cycling industry, the airplane industry, everyone. With SSYS you aren't jumping on a company that sells shovels during the gold rush. Your jumping on the company that gives everyone the chance to build their own damn shovel. Taking the bet on SSYS is not a ""Next Friday"" moment, you are rather looking into a growth over time chance. The beauty of this badger is: the current evaluation is under 3 billion.

The sad thing? You are too late. It is trading ~~near the ATH~~ at the highest level of the last 5 years. But hear me out, the real kicker is if you look at the charts. After the last earnings, there wasn't much movement. But then, during the overexposre of ARKK through TSLAs growth, someone has been buying in tranches day after day for nearly 2 months now. My theory is, institutional investors are starting to copy ARKKs investment strategy, loading up on different companies ARKK has been invested in. So yes this baby will fly higher because as far as I see it, there hasn't been much exposure to the retail world yet.

&#x200B;

[Ever since november its been a straight ramp up](https://preview.redd.it/5ubqsnoby9f61.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=94786daf76ba06ce57ddba65cc7e3912e53d56d6)

Why it will go up:

* Solid economics (200+k revenue per employee)
* Overall growth in the next 2Y will continue
* Exposure to exponential growth potential in 3D printing
* Low overall market cap (sub 3bn)
* Linear purchases over the last 2 months, seemingly larger investor with stepped investing strategy
* Not speculative: They have products, they are generating revenue, the fundamentals are working
* Perfectly in place at the right time
* No high volatility, IV is superfine if you are into calls
* Connected to other hypes: 3D Printing for EVs, Medical, and others.
* Covid situation independent, except for 3rd world war scenarios

The risks:

* ~~Trading too ATH, triggering additional capitalisation~~ (See edit, its trading its highest in the last 5Y but about 1/3 of its ATH. The risk therefore is more something like: 5 Year High could trigger additional capitalisation)
* Competition getting too good, driving revenue down (unlikely)
* Some early investor dropping out
* ARKK reducing their exposure or killing of SSYS publicly

**Edit:** Thanks to /u/YahyaJ - SSYS is nowhere near its ATH. ATH was at 136, were now at 49.

**Where I see it flying**

I think SSYS is going to steadily grow more and more accelerated. This steady growth will not stay under the radar, especially not when retail starts to look at the different investments ARKK is exposed to. I think within the next three months it will add another 30-40% through institutional investors and ETFs cloning ARKK. If you look at their exposure chart, ARKK even had to reduce their amount of SSYS for it to stabilise it's % in the ETF: [https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys](https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys). This runup has been to mechanical to ignore, inspite of it trading to ~~ATH~~ the highest level of the last 5 years.

I don't think its ready for a retail investor runup, aka: its not going to pop. But it is going to steadily climb, which should give a nice return on calls and stock. If it goes down in value (which it did during the covid dip), it will still be a valuable company that will one day pop off. There is no real bagholding exposure at this price level. You are investing in a technology that **will** rule the world and in a company that is ready to take the scepter. Options are a significant risk though.

**The rest**

I do not yet have a position, except for a few stocks I bought to track the stock (lul) and they made about 120% since november (damn). I will take a bigger one soon and will post my update here.

For options: Watch. the. spread!

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

2/3/21 19:04,"Another Perspective for GME This truly is a long play (I know, obviously — but want to write it out for people worried or on the fence). I think GME didn’t issue more shares at the inflated prices because it would have angered retail and risked even the slightest thought of GME also being a bad guy — given the intense amount of people on the hype train and the Twitter storms etc. It also would have given institutions a legit reason to drive price down.

I think Ryan Cohen and crew are waiting for this to die down, lose media attention, and let the price bottom out and consolidate before they continue to announce things. I also don’t think they’ll do a share offering until a couple of quarters from now (when price has risen steadily but big). The more I think about this, the more I think it’ll end up like TSLA. I think GME is about to have a stellar year or next two years, while squeezing shorts to <10% gradually. Shorts also won’t give up until GME starts putting up consecutive, big earnings numbers and milestones; just like Tesla did. 

I believe Ryan Cohen will turn this company around. He is proud (and rightfully so) of how he built Chewy and is clearly a success-driven leader. I am sure he is already getting excited to come out of this as the hero (just like Elon). 

A few popular DD’s were posted about this but last Thursday nearly (I think missed by minutes) triggered an explosive move and the real squeeze of GME. Now that it has been suppressed, I unfortunately believe a rapid squeeze won’t happen; and again, I think GME will rise steadily — and have some big weeks this year. I know it’s not the confirmation bias we all seek, but there has been some solid level-headed DD come out recently and I think if people aren’t setup for the long haul, they need to take a step back and position for that. For example: imagine getting in TSLA at $200 with a ton of shares and LEAPs; now, those folks are sitting on +300% gains and know the true meaning of holding long. 

Position: 3/19 175c (will be cutting soon and pushing out expiry) & 30 shares (avg. cost $172)

In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. 

[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn’t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won’t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer’s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump’s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don’t think this is likely. But it’s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth.

2/5/21 00:16,"Tesla overvalued? Or auto industry undervalued? First, I apologize for the non-GME related post. Just a thought I had. We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers have been saying it’s overvalued for the last I don’t know how long, or in a bubble (which, in all reality could be true).

However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft, Ford pairing with Google, and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the EV bandwagon. 

This got me thinking. Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford’s market cap is literally half of NIO’s (who has 7,000 employees). It’s hard to justify, in my mind at least.

I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional automakers  have in comparison to these other startups gives them a HUGE advantage.

But now that these guys are finally making their own EV’s, I think investors are starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well in the near future.

I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but very rarely that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an “energy company” and blah blah blah. What do y’all think? Am I stupid?

We find out for sure next week but I'm thinking bigger than that. Cohen made chewy which is worth 40 billion now. He just brought in a shit ton of help and is overhauling gamestop which ALREADY HAS A MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. Lets say if gamestop becomes as valuable as best buy at 30 billion, it would then be worth $500 a share. Without the short squeeze. Honestly with or without the squeeze I'm just gonna hold my shares. 

I originally bought 50@$15 because I liked the company and what Ryan Cohen had to offer. But like a paper handed bitch I sold a few on the way up. Well i bought it all back and much more to a total of 91$99 and I'm NOT SELLING 💎🙌. Many would argue Gamestop is worth at least $100 ($6 billion market cap) based on fundamentals but we dont use that word around here. Trust Cohen and let him do what he does best. Make ballin ass companies worth tens of billions in a few years. The squeeze may happen in time like TSLA exploded over the course of all last year.

Also what's better than the greatest marketing scheme anyone could have ever come up with? Gamestop went viral and all the zoomers buying xboxes are gonna wanna buy them from Gamestop.

No one individual gets to set the price of a stock, a stock price is completely based on supply and demand. No one individual gets to say I can't buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares.

2/4/21 14:48,"GME and why do we matter I  fling poop and drag my knuckles on the floor.  I am not a financial  advisor.  Do your own due diligence.  This is for entertainment purposes  only.

Lately,  I've felt like we don't have a voice and don't matter but I want to  remind all us apes that we are retarded together.  We will win TOGETHER  and we will HOLD together.  Could be days, weeks, or months.  Longer  than any of our attention spans.  So they will use TIME against us.  BUT  time is on our side.

This is  psychological warfare against us to make us DOUBT ourselves and what we  WILL accomplish.  We will remain retarded longer then they can remain  solvent.  They bleed interest each day.  A stock's value is based upon  what we place on it.  See TSLA for reference.  WE LIKE THE FUCKING  STOCK.  If my stock is worth 5k to me, I WILL HOLD for 5 fucking K.  WHO  are you to tell us how to perceive VALUE?  OHHHHH, you're an expert who  got caught with your dick in the cookie jar (thx louis rossman).   SHORTING 130-140% of a stock.  These hedgies aren't infallible.  Just  well connected and well resourced.  As long as we own shares that they  NEED, we have time on our side.  Even though it will not feel like it.

Obligatory, don't invest what you can't lose.

We  cannot let the hedgies deter us.  Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don't matter.  We don't know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn't have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.

LOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It's our $, let us do what  we want with it.  If a hedgie can irresponsibly short a stock over  100%, why can't we take a CALCULATED risk?  BUUUT funDamentAls.   Gamestop is a dying company.  The former business model of GME is dying.   As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I've never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He's  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.

How about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people's money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it's little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can't, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that's because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  Yet, we are not allowed to exploit the law  of supply and demand.  If the demand exceeds 100% of the supply, the  inherit value ROCKETS.  See RTX cards and AMD chips.  FUCK SCALPERS for  good measure :)

I want to remind  every single one of you, we do matter.  We have NUMBERS on our side.  As  a collective we've already made shorting a topic of conversation at the  political level.  This may not be a monetary victory but it hopefully  is a step in the right direction to a more equal game.  That or hold  your politicians accountable.  You are their constituents.

We  play out in the open.  We share publicly available information and make  decisions base.  Really, it's just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.  It prints $$$$ BRRrrrrr.

Let's recap how the odds are stacked against us.

\-We  are too stupid to be allowed to spend our money.  We need government  intervention to ""protect us"".  The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can't decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.

\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they're  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn't  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.

\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.

\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they're not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.

\-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them  ample time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.

""The most entertaining outcome is the most likely."" - Papa Musk

This is not financial advice, I just made this up with my primitive ape brain. This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.

I am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let's see where this goes. This is what I'm dubbing the ""Planet of the Apes"" theory.

The case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.

Long Rant:
So there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn't be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.

One of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I'm still holding and waiting. I'm not a fanboy, I've made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn't happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.💎💎✊✊ 

We all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He's done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that's why he's so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn't been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it's fair to say he likes the stock.

Now let's compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $4.7 BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I'm more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.

Now of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn't matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.

What does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past. 

TLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I'm actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story.

I doubt Elon is interested in this topic, and if he ever reads this, but I hope he at least considers engaging with GME although as it is very risky for him to take as his position at Tesla, but I think this aligns with his motto, for the people and future!

Some made big bucks or lost arms and legs from GME, but lets keep in mind that we love(d) GameStop once. 

GME's fundamental is now enhanced with the new Chief of Technology from Amazon specializing in AWS and is more promising than ever before to bring greater business model expanind it to online market. GME party is over though, this frenzy(?) is now recorded in history and will be taught for our future generations. But what will be the lesson for future generation? Think of what we were trying to achieve and why does it have to end? Here it is my idea how it should continue.

Tesla also went through the short attack and Wallstreet never granted its success until proven. Where does Tesla stand now? Put it aside, am I the only one if Tesla purchase GameStop and its synergy can upgrade to another level? Tesla needs to increase more sales and GameStop has offline stores and its customers including those who fought against short sellers. They  eventually will be an owner of Tesla car. Who would mind a Tesla car with all features, like entertainment system, gaming, watching movies, real time video call, and virtual reality system, and so on? Combine GameStop and Tesla,  wow lets call it TeStop(Tesla+GameStop) simply. Starlink can work with those TeStop offline stores as basestation for high speed internet(5G, 6G, or whatever), charging station, and shopping stores, and SpaceX or Boring ticket office to another side of earth and even to the moon. You name it and anything is possible. Its only a matter of who can make it happen. A person found a company but who develop it? Its people like us. Now people is one of the most powerful company's fundemental that makes a company successful. And GameStop is the one. As always, any risk to one can be a perfect opportunity to another.

I understand why they didn't do it early in the movement as they would betray their users but I feel like its coming and most of you haven't thought about it.

Apple also gave them an offer to either buy a large stake in the company or to become investors. This was in December 2020 so that could very well be a possibility.

Alright retards, let’s talk about SUNPOWER (SPWR)

OP, the “investor” fuck that he is, is looking for a long term hold and he thinks he found it: Sunpower (SPWR)

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the industry. And that fucking industry is rapidly growing. We are talking printer go fucking brrrr. Thank sleepy!

Just google “top solar companies” and tell OP which companies have the best product and best customer ratings. Spoiler alert, Sunpower is #1.

Sunpower hit $57 dollars before crashing down to $40 where it hit hard hard resistance today. Were talkin huge buy orders for 2 mill+. And even look at who owns it - bunch Blackrock, Citedal, the likes. I agree, fuck these guys, but at the same time, why bet against them? It’s gonna go up, and keep going up.

What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. 

Some technical analysis for you autists. Sunpower literally has a revenue of 274 million, while Sunrun (at over 2x the market cap) is at 209 million. Sunpower also cut manufacturing costs by splitting into two companies (SPWR and Maxeon Technolgies). Maxeon is manufacturing solar panels for SPWR, and they are doing it overseas. This split happened in late August and has yet to affect their profit, but will completely reshape SPWR’s profit margin in the near future.

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar sales don’t really pick up till spring. So getting in now and ride the rocket to the moon!

UPDATE 1: 
FAQs since y’all ask the same god damn questions 
- Why exercise instead of sell the contracts and just buy the shares? Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes. 
- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. 
- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it’s my biggest holding. It’s the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world’s most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I’m buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

2/5/21 19:08,"My Take on GMESTONK! Well, after a good shit kicking from the HFs the last few days (and a self induced liver quiver) we find ourselves almost back where we started. 

I mentioned a few of these points in the daily once or twice but I think they need to be pointed out again. 

Ryan Cohen isn't going to buy another 7% of his stake when the share price is $400. He might however top up with the share price under $50. That is probably the most bullish thesis for a low share price. If he locks up another 7% of the float you would almost have to be more retarded than WSB to hold a short position.

I dont have Twitter but someone mentioned that Cohen also just starting following DFV of Twitter so you know damn well he is keeping a close eye on what's going on. 
If I'm Cohen (and the rest of the board tbh) watching what is happening, I've got a shit eating grinn on my face the size of your wifes after her boyfriend is done with her. 
Why? 
Because us smooth-brained retailers (customers)  just served up an opportunity on a s_lv_r (fill in the vowels, I don't want to hear CNBC shilling the fucking commodity for another week) fucking platter.  

Think about this; if the company sticks up for their investors by issuing a call for shares, or reverse split, or some other means to ""find the shares"", it would a.) Be another good squeeze potential and b.) Solidify their business among retailers (customers) for years to come (sort of like Elon did with Tesla).  
Win for investors by straightening out this shorting bullshit, and win for them by gaining life long, loyal customers. 

Too many people get caught up in the PRICE of the stock, and not at the MARKET CAP of the company. I would argue right now that with expectations high for the quarter, a new console super cycle, Cohen and his posse on the board, the new C.T.O (ex AWS engineer), and pending transition into digital, that the stock is definitely UNDERVALUED at a current Market Cap of 3.7bil.

I'm considering starting up an investing club. While I've been doing this for a little while (about three years), I'm still really green and have a lot to learn.

The other thing I've learned is that with the tools at our disposal, it's really become possible for us little guys to stand up to the evil Oligarchs. To some degree, we can play ball with them. I only see this becoming more feasible as the years progress.

Would there be any interest in starting a trad investing club? We would primarily look for gains from companies who aren't bastards. Screw Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and all the other companies with dirty agendas.

What if we worked together to strengthen companies with values that protect us and empower us? 

I started investing in Tesla when Musk said he was leaving California because of the restrictions, when he said that he was opening his factory against orders to shut down and that he would be on the floor with his people.

I respect that. That's a leader I can get behind.

WHAT DID WE LEARN? 
We’re playing mass market psychology now. Panic induces selling-something autists and wall st has known for years. Knee jerk reaction to stop the bleeding. 

Mark cuban basically explained to the world how non dividend paying stocks are basically Pokémon cards. The loudest mid on the playground screams about his charizard and its worth what WE think it is. 

Fundamentals like DCF, EPS, were all an excuse to drive up price and make commissions. All supporting speculation. 

Zachs and moody’s and everyone else with buy, sell ratings helped to back that, but chamath even said, you dont know what GME’s worth. You dont know what TSLA is worth. 

GME could pull a Tesla. 
What happened with Tesla? Nobody could explain it but here’s my theory: retail liked the stock. Some really loud kids yelled that TSLA was a shiny holographic charizard. No fundamentals and in a debt crisis. Retail Doesn’t care about that tho. They know who Elon is. They know he’s smart. They think Tesla is worth a lot. Cool. So it went to $1000. And they did a 5:1 split so every share was worth 200 and then people who didn’t get it were like damn Tesla’s  cheap again! Fear campaign didn’t work because retail had conviction they were right and enough people felt like they were smarter than newscasters and it was fake news to help shorts. Or they didn’t even watch news. THEY REALLY LIKED TSLA.
It went back to $800. 
Every fundamentalist is afraid to touch it. Shorts got burned and nobody’s talking about it because they don’t wanna admit they have no clue how to value that one. It proved Cubans point for non dividend paying shares being no different than a Michael Jordan rookie card. 

The only reliable thing now is momentum and mass psychology. THERES NO REASON GME CANT PULL A TSLA. 

Cohen smart too. 

If they allow freedom in market retail has power. 

Rh proved that today. 

GME to 1000, 5:1 split. And back to $800. That’s the one scenario in which we stop thanos. 

BB follows, not because short interest but because tech is good & bullish. Not a phone company anymore. Software! BB also moon

AMC - shorted to deathly bankruptcy but now has so much cash they will survive covid. Can afford a thinktank to pivot into modern trends. They wont pull a blockbuster who served as a cautionary tale of hubris. Could have bought Netflix for 17MM but got greedy. 

Last but not least,
NOK- elon is definitely up to something here. Idk but he seems like the kind of person with a back up plan to a back up plan. Dude loves the internet. Is epic shitlord troll (literally released models: S3XY). And he’s gotta be motivated by revenge for getting jumped on and almost having to take TSLA private. 
Tinfoil hats: Tesla could acquire NOK. 

What happens if you are short NOK and it gets acquired? Short HAVE to cover. Force an expiration date. Tsla buys NOK for cheap. Elon get to middle finger shorts and the SEC. TSLA led my smart genius could use Nokia’s already established 5g ready infrastructure in their cars. Not only can they honk their horn to move bitch get out the way! But also with nokias infrastructure you will be able to yell at the idiot that just cut you off through their speakers. Yeeeeeew.

2/7/21 01:30,"Elon Musk is no Tony Stark Elon Musk (South African) is just an early investor who invested 6 million he had won selling his Paypal stocks months after Tesla was created by Eberhard and Tarpenning (Americans)

Elon likes to take credit for Tesla and the Tesla vision and mission, but he had nothing to do with its creation. 

In 2009, Elon used his lawyers to force the original founders Eberhard and Tarpenning through a lawsuit, that Elon won with his power, where he was granted the ""right"" to call himself a co-founder as well.

No wonder he supported Trump. He is just like him. He likes to take credit for things he did not even create.

He is no Tony Stark. He is just a bully investor who stole the credit from two American engineers.


He has used his persuasive tacticts to accumulate a cult of young minions that have invested all their savings in a company that produced losses until 2020. 

In 2020, Tesla had a positive net income for the first time since it was founded. The 2020 net income was a microscopic 721 million, which is nothing compared to the tens of billions that Honda and Toyota made in 2020.

Based on car sales, it is worth 12 billions.

Tesla is recalling a big portion (+130,000) of its cars while it only produces 500,000 a year. That forced Elon Musk to appear on Instagram this week to persuade his brainwashed young investors to buy the dip. He is a master manipulator.

Young investors will get burned, and he doesn't care.

Tesla is a bubble. It will make many investors lose a lot of money. See GME, individual investors got burned really burned while hedge funds made hundreds of millions in profits.

Hedge funds are already pulling out of the Tesla bubble. All the naive investors will get hurt again when Tesla collapses.

Tesla has not grown in a month. It already achieved its peak weeks ago, and has been declining.

You should realize your gains.

Ford and GMC are making better and cheaper Electric vehicles than Tesla. Ford and GMC will lead the EV market in one year. Europeans are no longer buying Tesla. Tesla was not even in the top 2 Evs bought by Scandinavians last year.  

The company was productive for many years but it already reached its peak. There is no more room for bubble growth. The cyber truck failed that's why it is not out yet.

It is all a frenzy.

Many scientists have always had their credit stolen by bullies throughout history. This is just another example.

GMC and Ford will dominate the U.S. EV market.

Tesla does not even have repair Tesla shops to handle the recalls. Tesla has to get into agreements with local repair shops to fix that mess.

Tesla is not Space X.

Elon did not just bully the real Tesla founders. He also bullied his employees, and they took him to court.

It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.

That beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.

Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.

I have been looking for a long term hold and I think I found it: Sunpower (SPWR)

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the 
hugely growing industry. Thank old Joe!

Just google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.

Sunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. It also has had a good consolidation in the last week so no is a great time to buy.

What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. 

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.

If you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.

1. You insulted Norway (the largest consumer of the car your looking to sell). Nice 👌

2. You told me nothing about why I should choose your car over others. Is it the battery? You mentioned it, but what does it do? Nice 👌

3. When someone’s looking to buy a car, when the fuck do they ever think hmmm, wonder what those Norwegians are doing. Nice 👌

This system is rife with corruption.  We can’t win against the big hedge funds, but there is a way to make them pay and that’s to not  even play.

2/6/21 15:33,"GME and future of WSB ? Fellow retards,

I have a couple points I'd like to discuss. I owned GME and sold it most of them when Robinhood screwed us for good. I made TENDIES which is what mattered and why I have been in the sub. I'm not a paid hedge fund bot or shill but I AGREE that hedge funds would love the current state of this sub in my smooth opinion.

I've been following the sub around a year. I was a retard and brained washed by boomer financial advices which didn't make me a lot of TENDIES. I got hooked in during March/April when the stock market crashed and autists made fortunes with puts on SPY and calls on Tesla. I was amazed by beautiful retardness.

WSB did something truly amazing. GME was the trade of this quarter century. A dude in basement with DDs and bunch of retards did something crazy. Thousands of retards made thousands of dollars. It has changed lifes for good for many people.

However, the sub has been fallen victim to its success. Let me be clear, the GME was to make Tendies. Taking out a hedge fund was a bonus not the purpose because we know the game is rigged. It's what it is. Unless you have a trillion dollar, you are not likely to change wall street for retail traders and retards. When GME took off and went viral, truly mentally challenged people of reddit homepage jumped on it and it has been transformed into a ""movement"". TVs, newspapers show this as little guys take on wall street and Elon Musk and Mark Cuban supported this(positions or ban?talk is cheap) I read bunch of comments and got heartbroken that people got in to make money and destroy hedge funds. Now, GME is the only thing. We have lost Tesla gang,Palantir gang,Palenton gang,theta gang who had provided real DD and were the people who came up with GME along with many other trades. Those people made WSB a place where retards gamble but with some sort of fundamental that can increase you change from 0 to 4.2069% Now we cannot hear them due to noise.

Now, the sub is filled with people who just yell ""HOLD!!!!!"" ""BUY MORE"" ""WHO HOLDS????"" ""GME WILL GO TO MOON"". I hope it does and people who got fucked recover. BUT THIS REDUCES THE SUB INTO A SINGLE TRADE where previously there were chances you can actually hear new retarded things that could make you money. Guess who benefits from this current state? GME Diamond Hands with $1000? or Wall St. who is playing carrot on a stick.

A hedge fund made $700M on GME. Citadel who has shady relationships with Robinhood made tons of money as market maker because of insane increase of volume. A lot of hedge funds shorted at $300s and made millions. And we are bombarded with truly stupid posts of ""WHO HOLDS GME????$5000 IS NOT A MEME"" I'd love hearing DDs like DFVs and explain the game plan but these people are actually retards. They just yell some slogans and getting emotional. Sharing the old finra report won't help US.

I wholeheartedly hope that GME holders are right, it goes to $5000 and makes millions. I'd be happy for them but if we narrow to one trade (or BANG), we actually give up millions of TENDIES on other trades. We don't get new info. We don't get new DDs. Please stop spamming and provide actual DD so it can actually bring people back on GME if you are right. This would help you too.

We need to find our next GMEs. That's how you make TENDIES. We need retards who got stuff right like messiah DFV so we can win. Everytime we make a good trade, you actually fight off the rigged system.

tl;dr: GME narrows down us to a single trade. We need to restore our DNA and get DDs,reduce noise and hear new things that can make us TENDIES. Otherwise GME can be cancerous to this sub which holds you back to make TENDIES

Last week companies like PLTR are back up and trending in the right direction. (I do hold PLTR) I think the EV stocks are about to do the same again as this other sideshow levels out.

Company - Quantumscape - QS  

Product - a lighter, more efficient battery for EV's. Charges faster than a Tesla battery. Protected with Patents so this is not common technology. Gets about 85% charge in 15 mins which is amazing.

Virtually No Debt. The biggest liability on their last Nov Balance sheet was deferred underwriting expenses. 

Volkswagen owns 20% of the company so there is a big potential customer with skin in the game and who can offer vehicle manufacturer feedback and input. They paid $300M for this so its not a gimme to get a good partner. One of their Execs sits in the board.

Bill Gates is also an investor - like him or hate him dude is smart.

After the big GM and Ford announcements this EV thing is real now. Its not just a Tesla thing or the odd product out of the majors. Big money is being put towards product development. This could be an argument for jus going to buy Tesla but its an expensive stock and has the good already priced in. So trying to find others is the challenge. These guys don't have the issues a manufacturer of cars does. Battery technology will have uses outside of vehicles. So that's why I like this component.

Quantumscapes battery is not a full Lithium battery. They are solid state Lithium. Lithium isn't great for the environment but it is the future of batteries so smaller and more efficient is a bonus.

Downside: this is not in major production right now. Its a great technology but is not actively in vehicles. Read: No sales.

The recent sell off was probably due to over excitement and the insiders sold shares after the lock up. However the remaining 95% of insider and employee shares are locked up.

This is not likely a moon shot tomorrow as these things take a while to fully develop but the SPAC gave them a piss pot of cash for R&D.

Next earnings release is Feb 16. If you are feeling good, you can get in before then. If you want to be conservative, wait until this is public. I don't expect there to be any sales. This will be an update on the battery technology and if they have taken on any debt. The last release was a $0.20 loss per share. This is not an all in share and should only be considered if you have some spec space in your account. 

Do your own homework. Check out the company's web page, read some articles. See if the difference in the solid state battery technology versus Lithium Ion makes sense. Forbes has a negative article on the company but its all based on valuation from companies who are not emerging. 

My brokerage firm shows 6.34% short interest. I will look at that as positive for the direction and not a positive in anticipation of a squeeze.

There is lots of talk about recycling batteries. Tesla says they plan to. There is also opportunities to use the battery after its life in the car. I don’t see any companies that are focused on this.

There is an ETF $LIT. I’m not thrilled with it though.

2/7/21 18:07,"Please enjoy my loss story, featuring TSLA, shorting, options, one too many Negroni’s and my perfectly smooth ape brain. Some of you may enjoy this, and writing it down will hopefully ease my pain a bit. It’s nothing earth-shattering, but my sheer stupidity still bugs me.

Last year in mid-Sep I felt super smart buying 100 shares in TSLA at ~440$ and selling a deep out of the money call at my take profit target of 510$ for mid-Dec expiry, which gave me 3000$ (plus another 1000$ for selling a put for the same date also deep out of the money ~200$). 

Move ahead two months and it’s a late evening in mid-Nov: I am in Asia so live US trading is late nights. Had a great night ending up with my special Negronis that made me extra positive and (at least I thought) alert.

Before bed I checked the stock and at ~400$ I had lost around 4000$ on the stock, but the call had reduced enough in price to be nearly worthless, so I was willing to buy it back and sell a new call, ie neutralize my stock loss on the options, hold the TSLA stock position, and perhaps make some extra cash on selling farther out dated and money call.

So I log on my brokerage account, see TSLA, click close position, skim but don’t really read, and click submit... aaaand that’s when my stock position vanished.

I had closed the wrong position.🤦🏻 Instead of taking profit on the shorted call, I had stoploss’ed the stock position. Ie now I had not only realized 4000$ in losses on the stock, I was also sitting on an uncovered short call.

After this disaster, I called it a night and just left the call where it was, telling myself it’s not so risky since the stock will not reach 510$ in one month, so I could just let my shorted options expire for free.

Fast forward a month later: stock is indeed not at 510$, but instead at 700$! I scramble and barely manage to close my call at 16k loss on a dip on expiry day.

1. I took a -4000$ loss on equity position by mistake.
2. By mid-Dec that position would have been worth +16k and by now has doubled.
3. I did this instead of buying back my call at 3000$ realized profit
4. Instead I kept that cursed now uncovered short call, which ended up costing me another -16k to close eventually.

So a 2-3month play with 44k invested that would have yielded already +20k plus by mid-Dec turned into -20k loss (with fees). It looks even worse now, since I of course would have kept the stock position going and get a new long dated far out of the money short call. 🤦🏻

The moral: don’t drink and trade (+my Negroni’s are awesome). Anyways, I’ll use that excuse, but my smooth lazy ape brain likely would have done so anyhow.

2/7/21 16:43,"Bloomberg: Robinhood Traders Have a Troubled Track Record of Stock Picking [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium)

&#x200B;

Back in May, a Reddit poster hit WallStreetBets with a sure-thing tip on Scorpio Tankers Inc. The oil shipper, trading at one-fifth the value of its assets, was a screaming buy with storage rates soaring, insiders leveraging up and oil vaulting back after briefly going negative.

&#x200B;

There’s an opportunity to see “100% returns within the next year,” the user said.

&#x200B;

Eight months later, the reward: a 17% loss.

&#x200B;

Another WallStreetBets poster was similarly breathless about their bright idea to short Tesla Inc. in 2018. The outcome: a 1,330% loss, not including borrow fees, assuming they stuck with it.

&#x200B;

Picking stocks is hard. Almost nobody has an edge, and it’s no mark of shame when a call fails to pan out.

&#x200B;

But in all the hagiography being bestowed on Reddit traders who latched on to GameStop Corp. before it rocketed skyward, it’s worth remembering that a big enough sample of predictions will always yield a few winners. Evidence of investing genius elsewhere is hard to find.

&#x200B;

It is these cautionary tales on stock-picking that are documented in research covering this era of WallStreetBets. A new paper finds that on average when retail traders on Robinhood Markets buy a stock, it doesn’t perform better over the next three to 20 days.

&#x200B;

In fact, it tends to do a little worse.

&#x200B;

A speculator's record trading GameStop would depend on their timing

“Robinhood investors’ evident lack of skill in aggregate is consistent with commission-free investors behaving as uninformed noise traders,” wrote Gregory W. Eaton and Brian S. Roseman from Oklahoma State University and T. Clifton Green and Yanbin Wu from Emory University.

&#x200B;

The authors also found that stocks with buzz on WallStreetBets see a spike in activity on Robinhood a few days later, a sign there’s likely much overlap between the two communities.

&#x200B;

To isolate investment skill, the academics adjusted 2020 returns for recent price moves and risk factors like valuations and the size of a company. The upshot: When you strip out the possibility that these traders are simply chasing market trends, they don’t actually end up picking future winners.

&#x200B;

The results don’t mean retail investors across all brokerages are bad stock pickers. In fact, the four scholars found that increased buying of a company’s shares by the group overall did predict higher future returns. The problem for the Robinhood contingent is that they typically pile onto a stock nearly a week after the bulk of their peers.

&#x200B;

“Although retail traders in aggregate appear to invest in the same types of securities that are popular among Robinhood investors, we find that the broader measure of retail trading leads Robinhood trading by several days, which may help explain the difference in performance,” the authors wrote.

&#x200B;

The research covers only the first eight months of last year because Robinhood stopped publicizing the number of users holding each stock in August.

&#x200B;

To be fair to Robinhood, it seems likely the pattern is not limited to their platform. Another paper has shown smartphones in general make people more likely to buy risky assets and chase past returns -- partly because apps allow them to trade in the evening without thinking too much.

&#x200B;

Bragging Rights

As the GameStop rally comes back to Earth, the new research may offer a gut-check to amateurs whose bragging rights over the past week reached fever pitch.

&#x200B;

Yet plenty of them would take issue with its conclusions, given how many in this new investing generation appear to have minted fortunes while besting hedge funds -- largely empowered by zero-commission trading platforms.

&#x200B;

When markets were lashed by Covid in the roughly six months through July 2020, a portfolio comprising the most popular stocks on the Robinhood app returned an annualized 105%, according to Wolfe Research.

&#x200B;

GameStop Corp., the poster child of retail speculation, is still more than 238% higher this year even after its recent plunge. Throw in Sundial Growers Inc. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., and the Robinhood crowd would seem to have several stories of incredible success.

&#x200B;

The phenomenon remains relatively young, so firm conclusions about the stock-picking skills or otherwise of those involved might be premature. And to the speculators who have reaped profits on these platforms, it may not matter much whether it was down to picking winners or following the momentum of the market.

&#x200B;

The success of retail traders in general has been documented by various academics across different time frames and methods. In a paper last year, Ivo Welch, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, showed a portfolio of common Robinhood holdings beat market benchmarks and a quant factor model in the two years through mid-2020.

&#x200B;

Welch’s work focused on stocks widely owned by users, rather than those seeing an increase in buying on the platform. The recent paper focused squarely on whether more purchases from the Robinhood crowd actually led to superior performance -- or not.

&#x200B;

“Our evidence suggests that zero-commission investors in aggregate behave as noise traders, with changes in Robinhood ownership being unrelated to future returns,” the academics wrote.",31926,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.987660885,True
2/7/21 16:10,"Revisiting My Favorite 馬: $PDD $PDD, or PinDuoDuo, is the stock that I like more than any other stock on the market based on fundamentals and macroeconomics. I will try to keep this short for fellow retards and I will also share why I could be wrong to keep things fair and balanced.

Keep in mind, since Wall Street thinks we are all dumbasses, this stock is likely to go down after I write this post. If it does, I will most certainly be loading up on more stock and a lot more options.

Edit: two months ago, I wrote about a PT for PDD of $180 that the mods removed, but the stock skyrocketed right after earnings. I was right then. I'm right again.

# What is PinDuoDuo

PinDuoDuo is an ecommerce company in China founded in 2015 by a former Google software engineer. The company is pioneering the concept of social ecommerce, an idea that product discovery is best facilitated as recommendations from people in your network. Most product discovery on the web today is driven by searches on the web, so this a novel business model.\* Th company also pioneered a group buying function whereby customers that can get more people to buy with them can get further discounted prices for goods. Until somebody whined about it, PinDuoDuo was the best place in the world to buy a Tesla. 😂\*\*

**By the numbers:**

Market Cap Today: 221 BillionMarket Cap August 2018: 19 BillionRevenue Growth Reported Last Quarter: 89% YoYMost Recent Report of Active Buyers: 737 MillionAlibaba Daily Active Buyers: 757 Million Active UsersRevenue: RMB 14.2 BillionFirst Ever Profitable Quarter: Last Quarter (FY2021Q3)Internet Penetration in Rural China: Grew 13% from March 2020 to June 2020. It's over 50% and growing, there by growing the PDD SAM, or serviceable addressable market.

Some might argue that they have grown too fast, but let's take a look at few key factors.

&#x200B;

1.There is a major holiday around the corner, February 11-17. $PDD has played a key role in practically every single holiday in China. Single's Day was even a huge success for the group buying platform because singles grouped together to give each other gifts for being single. I know for a fact that we can emphasize with those users as a community. This year, I will be buying valentine's day gifts for my wife's boyfriend, and all my friends in similar circumstances will do the same.

On a serious note, the Chinese New Year has begun. It has historically been the largest periodic people migration on the planet. Due to Covid fears and other factors, many families will not get together this year if they live in different cities. For China, that usually means there will be a fuck ton of  food purchased to fill plates that don't have eaters hovering over them. That's the tradition. There will also probably be some gift buying happening for citizens that cannot travel as expression of concern. PinDuoDuo's recent move into agriculture will likely spell historic gains for the business in terms of revenue growth, but also in terms of user acquisition.

2. PinDuoDuo international growth is quietly accelerating. They don't talk about much and I don't totally understand why. [Lots of companies are working with them](https://agencychina.com/blog/pinduoduo-for-china-cross-border-e-commerce/) for cross-border social commerce. The retail market for overseas Chinese with family in China is well in the Trillions RMB. Wall Street just missed here.

3. PinDuoDuo dominates in China's 2nd and 3rd Tier cities. [Tier 1 cities like Shanghai have experienced slowed growth](http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2020-11/10/content_76895684_10.htm), while PDD increases penetration there anyway. Seeing as China is posted the best performing economy of any of the major economies by far, it seems that this fact is more important than the market has realized.

4. Amazing technology. Here is where I laugh my ass off at the Morningstar's of the world. They don't know shit about how hard it is to build good software. PinDuoDuo's software has an amazing track record and they are very focused on improving the customer experience constantly. Customer experience is the differentiator for the business.

5. Not a short squeeze you have to catch the run up or any of that. I like the stock for several years. I expect the company to be the largest retailer in China, the world's second largest retail market and growing rapidly, by the end of 2021.

6. Gradually reducing the cash burn from marketing spend. The reason why PinDuoDuo has only posted a single profit is because of the need to quickly acquire customers in a very competitive and fast growing market. Their reliance on marketing spend is dropping rapidly as they start to win more and more customers through brand loyalty and reputation. Their product is very sticky, social, and nurtured by social network density. We can expect a monster earnings report of 3/10.

My Bullish Price Target: $375

I am basing this on an aggressive revenue multiple that compares their 3-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) with the other leaders in the market. Keep in mind that their 5 year is not available because they haven't even been public that long. The three year figure for them is a monstrous **290%**. If their product catches on in other markets in Asia and parts of the west, we could see that number skyrocket. I hope for them to buy successful brands in other markets, swap the technology for their own, and further improve their recommendation engine's moat with the troves of data they have for operating these systems. If they can penetrate, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Oceania, damn son. My PT is too low. If not, I expect the Chinese market to drive enough growth that this figure is a reasonable price target on a \~45x multiple. Shopify gets this multiple and isn't even as cool. I expect them to partner with mobile device manufacturers and brands to bring a more integrated experience to market over the next few years. The tier 1 city growth also  paints a bright future for the prospects of the stock.

&#x200B;

My Bearish Price Target:  $235

The Chinese market is red hot and due for a cool down. While I think that such a turn is unlikely in the short term, there are some challenges that operating in Chinese pose for fast growing businesses. Some unknowns for me include the regulatory landscape on personal information and how much data  can be used to power personalized experiences for your users. My limited research has suggested that this is not a problem in China like it is in the EU or the Americas, but the right to be forgotten is growing traction globally. There may be some movement in China for reform, though it seems unlikely, that challenges the ability for PinDuoDuo to generate such high quality recommendations. I cannot see the company growing substantially over the next six months for any reason short of a war or political unrest. During the brief period of unrest in the US, the stock market climbed. In closing, if they continue to grow in the tier 1 cities, their reputation for fake/counterfeit products means that they will likely falter at key growth opportunities. Since stocks go up, they gain 30-40 $'s a share on a bad year by my estimation.

Positions:

\~$100 C Jan 22

&#x200B;

\~$250 C Jan 22

If I hit my bullish price target, I will probably only exercise the options and hold for an Amazon ten years because that is very fast growth. I would likely want to take profits on the $250 to wait for a pullback to buy even more options because my bullish target is right for the next two years or so. If we hit the bearish target over the next few months, and only barely get in the money by the time we get into the expiration date, I will likely exercise all options because what a steal. I know the stock will be at $375 in no time.

Embarrassingly, I dropped a lot of shares to join the mega-fucking-obvious GME/AMC short squeezes. Holding those stocks until capital gains at this point.

I still have $270 and $100 call options for next year purchased quite a while ago. I will be entering more options plays for the June earnings over the course of the next several weeks. I will be happy to post those positions here as I acquire them. I am not a technical investor. I invest on macroeconomic trends that impact companies and I am doing quite well. I am also not a financial advisor and do not know shit, but I am very hopeful about the growth prospects of this company. I like this stock.

I think three things need to happen for $GME to go up 🚀🌑.

First, the business has to show improvements. The most crucial factor to convince a 🌈🐻 that he/she should not be bearish is business' growth in customers, services, cash flow, profit, whatever else that can be counted as a good thing. There are many good things going for GME now in terms of new talent in the team, new consoles, all this hype, etc., so I look forward to seeing improvements that tear down the bear theory.

Second, obviously, shareholders need to hold the shares 🤚💎✋ and buy the dips. Moreover, I think community involvement can help: from visiting the store and buying some goodies from them, to sharing good experiences on social media, all the way to reaching out to the leadership of the company and telling them about what is bad and needs to improve (constructive feedback). Papa Cohen, if you read this, I want free shipping on orders above $25 please!

Third, also obviously, the shorts covering their shorts should drive the price up. I strongly believe that this will not happen just because it hurts them in their vaginas. Remember Elon and how he had to invite (literally call out) the head of a fund that was shorting TSLA to visit the factories and see with his eyes that things are for real? Shorters stopped shorting TSLA when they and their clients stopped being 🌈🐻 about it, and not so much because they were bleeding money.

2/8/21 02:28,"FUBO massive growth prospects, the importance of addressable market size (TAM) and revenue per customer (CLV) FUBO TV is a sports focused “cable on the internet” streaming service, replacing your cable package (avg. $100+ per month) for $65 per month. In January they acquired Vigtory, a sports betting startup, and will integrate it into their streaming platform this year. Entering 2021 FUBO has \~500,000 subscribers, with 80% year over year growth, and a market value of \~$5 billion.

These numbers mean two things: First, **FUBO has a proven product** with traction and growth. Second, it has **just started to penetrate a massive market**. While there are many excellent companies in the streaming and sports betting space, most are already past this growth phase. ROKU has a market cap of $55 billion. DKNG has a market cap of $25 billion. PENN has a market cap of $20 billion. This is why all the analysts are excited about FUBO. **It is much easier for FUBO to go from $5 billion to $50 billion over the next few years, than a competitor to go from $25-$50 billion to $500 billion which is Facebook/Tesla level.**

There are still 80 million Americans who have yet to cut the cord, who can probably save money today by switching to FUBO. There are 30 million Americans who have cut the cord, and can add live sports with FUBO while the bars are closed. All of them can spend a lot more money on FUBO once betting is up, since the Supreme Court struck down the federal sports betting law in 2018 in Murphy vs. NCAA.

Combining a $100 billion a year streaming/cable market, with a $20 billion a year and growing sports betting market, means enormous growth prospects for little FUBO at $400 million a year revenue and 80% year over year growth.

At $50 a share, FUBO’s valuation is about $10,000 per subscriber. This is about 10x the Netflix valuation of $1000 per subscriber. This might seem high, but it is in fact a fair valuation for several reasons. First, it is a $65 per month product. Second, it has increased its advertising revenue 153% last year to a small but significant $7.5 million. Third, sports betting could make a large percent of FUBO subscribers 100x more valuable than the typical streaming customer. Fourth, Netflix has 200 million subscribers vs FUBO’s 500 thousand, meaning more value can be imputed to growth. Most importantly, all these reasons are still applicable even if FUBO grows another 50-100% for the next few years. FUBO’s customer lifetime value (CLV) is probably already above the norm, and can moon with more advertising and gambling. That is why many are confident that FUBO can be the next ROKU, and reach $200/share or more in the next few years.

In fact, **at $50 per share FUBO’s price/sales is \~45, compared with 56 for DKNG and 35 for ROKU, despite having better growth prospects.** This means FUBO can probably sustain a higher price today, even before news over the next year validates the growth thesis. And there might be short squeeze! (See other DD for that).

I am long FUBO with both shares and calls. I am not a financial advisor.

&#x200B;

**Addendum 2/9:**

I have been doing more research, specifically into the bear thesis that FUBO will get killed by incumbents via competition and bad content deals. Well it turns out that short seller fud is bs. FUBO is strongly supported by major industry players, and I am sure the margins/deals will improve with growth. Here are some random tidbits to calm the nerves.

3. Edgar Bronfman Jr. is the Chairman of the Board

He is a billionaire that has been Chairman and/or CEO of Warner Music Group, Vivendi Universal, and Seagrams (he is the heir). Presumably he can twist arms if the legacies do anything too unfair.

&#x200B;

4. Reverse merger with Facebank Group in 2020

Facebank Group was founded by John Textor and makes those holograms at music festivals. Tupac at Coachella was Textor's work. What does this weirdness mean? 1) They are probably smart enough to pull off the sports betting tech. 2) They have weird aces up their sleeve. 3) I'm buying more FUBO

Hey Elon that's the hedge fund managers making them talk

But we didn't fuck them up yet, see I ain't like you.

Cause if they buy more shorts they'll suffer more and then they'll go bankrupt too.

Well gotta go they are taking my laptop and my car now

# EDIT: Elon's reponse:

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy

You said your wife's pregnant by her boyfriend now, how far along is she?

Look, I'm really flattered you would buy TSLA calls like that

And here's an autograph for your Mother

I wrote it on the Tesla cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the annual stockholder meeting, I must have missed you

Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you

But what's this shit you said about you sold your GME when it fell too?

I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?

You got some gambling issues Stan, I think you need some counseling

To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when your stocks get down some

And what's this shit about us being ""in this together""?

I'm a billionaire lol

I really think you and your wife need each other

Or maybe you just need to treat her boyfriend better

I hope you get to read this message, I just hope it reaches you in time

Before you sell again, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan

Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do have diamond hands

I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago so I bought GME in the dips

Some dude was high on PCP and drove his car to a Gamestop

And ""STONKS"" he screamed, for 24 hours outside the closed shop non-stop

And in the car they found a phone with 0 GME left, but I forgot who it belonged to

Come to think about, his name was, it was you

2/8/21 04:39,"Retard apes, I hereby present you the #1 Stock of 2021 ---- RDFN Fellow autists,

You heard it here 1st. Redfin will be the #1 stock of 2021.

That's right, that shitty red website that your wife's bf keeps browsing while he hogs your shitty Wi-Fi (cause you can no longer afford the premium on decent internet service due to GME losses) is gonna be the gangbuster stock of 2021.

Why? As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.

1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35
2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the *medium* term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings. Redfin is the Netflix of real estate due to its amazing website, customer engagement and disruptive fee schedule (who the F wants to pay 3.5% to sell their home when you can pay 1.5%? I sure don't)
3. Traffic to Redfin is skyrocketing. For those genius apes capable of interpreting a super simple graph here it is: [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section_traffic) You get what means, retards? From 660 to 460s is a FKING huge jump at those levels. Now let's compare with their main ""competitor"" Zillow [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section_traffic) See that? ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't.
4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now. Or 1/2 a Gamestop if you bought at $250 and still holding like a true retarded hero.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Sold a f ton of puts on  Jan 22 and used the proceeds those to buy 85, 90 and 120 calls expiring in Jan 22. Price target for 2021 is $400. Dead serious here. Or for you Papa Elon fans, $420 and funding secured.

Before it was TSLA, AMD, weed stocks and we always had extremely bullish retards writing long ass DD to justify their rationale. We also had bearish bears writing theories like quadwitching where we collectively lost money. But even when at peak Tesla, we still had posts about small pee pee AAPL gains, and loss porn because of the Mouse 🐁

I also threw money like y'all in GME and didn't close while ahead. I'm going to diamond hand this because frankly I don't have an exit strategy and with options, I somewhat broke even for stocks i bought. Now we can keep crying about money lost or try to make new money. There are lot of plays going on. What happened to my PLTR gang? Why are y'all so silent? Weed stocks are going up again, yet we ain't paying attention. BYND been shooting again, crossing some important levels. TSLA back to 850+. We had some crazy ass earnings reports from big tech, again no discussion. And it's not like people aren't posting, there are some posts but they're not getting any traction because we're literally stuck in this GME loop. 

So i ask all of you, new and old gang, to take a break and think what's the way out? We can circle jerk all day and cry about those hedge funds and the media and the manipulation like we've been doing for past two weeks. Or we can start looking for new plays and buy new consoles from GameStop. At least that's a better plan than just simply hoping to pump questionable DD posts to r/all and expecting momentum swing.

I had to read that thread a couple of times. Forget being a gay bear on TSLA. No one buying $20p expects it to go ITM

However, when GME was pumping, I bought some March $30p for $1 and when GME pumped to $480, I sold them for $1.60

HOW CAN SHE SLAP!?! Because the IV on the option chain shot up to 1000%

I did some digging around and some big money boy bought a metric fuck ton of Feb & Mar $20p, check out the OI

So how do I make money off this shit?! TSLA currenttly has an IV of ~70% 

Last month it was at ~85%

Dec IV was ~110%

If the volatility in TSLA picks up back to the 85% range, ToS is telling me these $20p should go from $.04 to around $.12

Say what you will, that is 200% increase

If IV goes back to 100% range and Tsla drops to around $750 sharply (like in one session) then these can be worth around $.50

Will I be able to sell them if they pump that high? Who the fuck knows. Someone bought 500k of these, so why not throw some cash at it

2/8/21 18:00,"AMC Major Stakeholder Wanda Converts Stock To Allow For Sale A major Chinese investor in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) converted its shares in the cinema operator in order to be able to sell them, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.

The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $2.5 billion in May 2012.

Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.

The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.

In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.

I think Tesla (and daddy musk) has a long runway ahead especially if they’re going to grow productions 50% compounding YoY in auto sales which means that by Apple makes their first car in 2025, Tesla will be producing $2.5million electric vehicles. Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to 2.1% from Ford, gm, etc.

Tesla’s auto business: has a lot of potential and there’s a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale. 

Tesla insurance: they’re hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they’ll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road. Imagine an insurance company that can gather all camera feeds from the cars to evaluate accidents/damage claims and pass savings down to the customer. Win win. Huge potential.

Tesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over 1.3 million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner - FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it’ll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue.


Tesla Semi: this is one I’m super interested in. Walmart and other logistics businesses already bought thousands on back order. Compared to a 18 wheeler, a semi is 35% more efficient (and faster) meaning 35% or more reduction in transportation cost expanding margins for businesses. No brainer.

Aurora: 18.6x

HEXO: 16x

TerrAscend: 31.7x

**EDIT 2:** My bad I had the wrong conversion rate. It's late where I am. Just updated to reflect that. The point still stands: It's not that I'm bearish on weed as a whole - I think TLRY's rise compared to its peers in the industry is may present a bear opportunity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Listen up y’all. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‘round. Remember, true diamond hands don’t care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now let’s learn some basic corporate finance together.

We need to talk about TLRY.

As you all know, TLRY spiked today…and the day before…etc…up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I’m proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I’m here to explain why.

Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I’m not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I’m going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I’m going to use only numbers directly from TLRY’s merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).

Let’s start with two basic facts:

TLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million

APHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million

Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company – nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria’s stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.84:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.

We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.

Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!

Carrying on with the valuation…we add the merged company’s debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) – and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.

Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, “Why do multiples matter?”. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to…..43.9x. Let me say that again: 43.9x. That’s saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.

&#x200B;

Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!

I just want to make sure you all don’t get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don’t tell me “it’s about the potential”. Potential isn’t realized through a press release, and you know it.

Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren’t even US focused. Seriously – read their securities filings.

Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).

&#x200B;

**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.

Remember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.

This is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.

There will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.

**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)

Instead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.

Even though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are ""unusual expenses,"" implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. 

**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.

Yup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a ""tough on crime"" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.

Ford Motors is currently undervalued ($45B) after an underperforming Q4 but is taking the right steps to compete in the electric and autonomous vehicle markets going forward.

**Reasons**

* Ford is already in an upward trend the past 30 days. This week they just released news of their **$29 Billion** (with a 'B') investment into their electric and autonomous vehicles department  ([link](https://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-ev-investment-2025/)) surpassing that of General Motors.
* Ford now has it's first credible mass-market competition to Tesla in the [2021 Mustang Mach-E electric crossover SUV](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e/) which goes on sale later this year.
* Ford is bringing the real 'merica to electric trucks (sorry Elon) with it's upcoming [F-150 full-size truck](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2021/2021-ford-f-150-first-look-review/) in mid-2022.
* Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, looking to IPO this year ([link](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/manufacturing/rivian-backed-amazon-and-ford-aims-ipo-year))
* Ford in the running to be Post Office's next delivery vehicle ([link](https://fordauthority.com/2020/12/ford-transit-in-running-to-become-post-offices-next-delivery-vehicle/))
* The **new Ford Bronco release date** is spring 2021. ([link](https://www.ford.com/bronco/))
* Tesla is in trouble with Chinese regulators and other companies are ready to take up some market share.
* Even if you don't buy options and are just a share investor, Ford Motors has a respectable 1.30 Dividend Yield.
* And if you don't believe me an actual (non-monkey) analyst has already said it would be going up to $14 ([link](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-upgraded-to-buy-at-argus-with-a-price-target-that-matches-the-street-high-2021-02-09)).

**Speculation**

With Tesla leading the market in electric vehicles, America needs competition to take place. Who better than one of the oldest vehicle manufacturers? Ford knows trucks, which will be a big part of the upcoming electric market. How many times have you heard two bro's start arguing about trucks and inevitably one of them is always a Ford?!? The stock is ripe for the taking and if you want to get some tendies, you should get in now.

My issue is that I’m consistently making boomer plays now and I can’t help myself. Last year things stopped making sense to me, and the stuff that did make sense didn’t pan out... thanks PCG.

I think people that made their GME millions in these risky plays will be looking for Boomer plays now that they are done gambling.

I also think the market, now, functions like a voting system where individual traders are investing in what they want the new world to look like, not what is exactly the best investment.

Here are my plays.

I think PCG goes to $20/ share in the expectation of a dividend in 2023. That might be in 2022... too far out. (yes... I am too boomer to understand this is not a good idea). I had a few 2023/$10 calls, but, I used the gains for a vasectomy. (Worth it)

I think STWD recovers. They’re a REIT with a 10% dividend. And they’re still down with $6 to go prior to reaching where they were prior to COVID.

SENS (handful of shares), IDEX (probably a bad idea to have shares), And a handful of penny stocks. All of these plays are up 100%.

Maybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.

I believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.

There is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:

1. EV credits are coming
2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.
3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps.

25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) 

Note that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.

This is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ

Basically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.

I wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN

You can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.

So what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1

You probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.

At the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. 

Did you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it?

2/11/21 22:51,"($SPCE) WSB VS UBS: THE CASE FOR SPCE $2000 TLDR - Pre-rev company Virgin Galactic has significant levers in the business model that are unaccounted for by the sell-side. Technical setup is good. Tons of catalysts in the short-term. Could see this trade to $100-200 on a successful test flight this weekend.

**What the Sell-side is Missing**

You know what the beauty of a pre revenue and a highly disruptive company is? The opportunities are endless and only limited by lack of imagination. Think TSLA early days. 

Yesterday, UBS downgraded SPCE because of its ""stratospheric stock move"", claiming  valuation ""appears full following a 100%+ gain since the start of the year"", while also upping valuation from $35/share to $52/share (aka we are at fair value according to the UBS). We have three things to say to UBS:

1) Virgin Galactic, along with Blue Origin and SpaceX, are the top players in an emerging industry, that has the potential to change the way we travel, communicate and harvest resources. 

2) The general investing public has limited understanding that they can invest in space via SPCE; and 

3) You don't hop off of the tendies train before getting to the station

Below we present our DCF showing how we could theoretically make the case for SPCE $2000. These are aggressive forecasts and Virgin Galactic would need flawless execution from here on out, but the possibilities are basically endless. Who knows what will happen in 10 years....UBS sure doesn't.

[Source: We = Me and your dad; not investment advice, do your own dd](https://preview.redd.it/pai22wzt6qg61.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e415773466aa75aed75a19cc6fea7680fc88355)

Here are some revenue drivers that are likely unaccounted for in sell-side models. Ordered from insane to most insane.

**Sub-orbital Pricing**

We expect sub-orbital ticket pricing to be much higher than the sell-side is anticipating. As of right now, the list price for a ticket is $250k...and we expect the first 2000 unencumbered flights to cost $2Mn+. Our rationale stems from Virgin Galactic's ""one small step"" program application where individuals signing up for the waiting list were prompted with options to select their preferred price range. There was a $1Mn+ ticket option and the company inferred in the application that tickets would likely go for $1Mn+. 

[SS2 approaching Space](https://preview.redd.it/s659l5tz9qg61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2661e8ce927ead7d7cbe49484a72e93b3ba2d705)

**Hypersonic Travel**

This will be the most significant revenue driver in the near term if achieved. Hypersonic travel has the potential to upend the existing transatlantic/ultra-long-haul travel regime. We are talking Howard Hughes type stuff. LA to Tokyo in 2.5 hours....unreal. 

While management has remained tight lipped about its hypersonic program, we ultimately expect Virgin Galactic to acquire Boom Supersonic in a stock for stock deal at some point in the next year. We believe that this would speed up VG's go-to-market by three years, with service starting in 2025.

[VG Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/3clhvjfrcqg61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8e321766d6163ddb0eda6b001b7c971e6138c5d)

[Boom Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/oq2l07cwcqg61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac6caf58a1c803949b5e7c0d8959827348ff466b)

**Satellite Launch Biz**

While we recognize that Richard Branson's other space company, Virgin Orbit, plays in this space, we would not rule out Virgin Galactic expanding into this business as well. Keep in mind, Richard Branson is a minority shareholder of VG and VG has a fiduciary duty to all shareholders. If Virgin Galactic could adapt its current infrastructure to implement satellite launch capabilities, we would expect them to pursue this business.

Our thoughts stem from: 1) Virgin Galactic's recent petition to the DOT and FAA for more use cases for its mothership, White Knight Two; and 2) White Knight Two was originally a dual purpose aircraft for both sub-orbital human travel and satellite launches.

[WK2 launching satellites](https://preview.redd.it/6l93144uoqg61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b073ee4447586fd23d2b22b69dfb3d1931d2ff8)

**Consumer Division**

The only thing more disruptive to the automotive industry regime than electric vehicles is....flying vehicles. While we believe that SpaceX/Tesla will pioneer the technology, we expect VG to be a top three player if they pursue this opportunity. Again, this is futuristic but possible, and a long time coming. We believe our current revenue forecasts are conservative IF they are able to develop this technology. Again we, and UBS, have no idea what the world will look like in 10 years....so it's possible. VG has the IP and knowledge to be among the first-movers in this space.

**Space Mining**

Screw it, why not? With the environmental conservation push enveloping the globe, we could see mining on earth completely outlawed if humanity is able to exploit asteroid/lunar mining.

**SETUP/TECHNICALS**

Today will be a key day technically. UBS attempted to stop the tendies train with their downgrade yesterday, which caused a slight breaking of trend support. Fear not, we have seen this pattern before and could possibly break the resistance that we have been battling for the last two weeks. We believe we are in the oversold/consolidation phase similar to what we saw last month. We additionally note that by 2pm today the 200 hour moving average will be at current levels adding additional support to the uptrend.

[Hourly SPCE chart](https://preview.redd.it/npz8ggkigug61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97bc8f40b4f8dbb7c4acbf88111ec5ee9c8071e)

And if we pull a similar move to last year's parabolic move on a percentage increase basis, we could see SPCE at $136 in the n/t.

[SPCE weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/kzc7y3c2aug61.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fda9fd8a31c02b845208e5e3b89b5e06372b67)

Additionally, hype is building quickly. As shown below, the SPCE subreddit sub count is reaching new highs everyday, which we expect to go parabolic should VG have a successful launch over the next week. Keep in mind, the general investing public is still not aware that SPCE exists and we expect broad public equity support after a successful launch.

[Subs on SPCE subreddit ](https://preview.redd.it/j1te6lykxtg61.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=da8725eec85da44a039b5617f284482929d6accc)

Last but not least...the **short interest data**. Virgin Galactic is currently one of the most heavily shorted US stocks with S3 recently noting that there is over $2Bn betting against VG.  We estimate SPCE's public float (ex-Virgin Group/SoCap/Aabar) at 60 million shares (60mn shares\*50 price=$3Bn). We therefore believe that \~70% of the float is short. Additionally, the call option wall is stacked, and any major movement on a successful launch will likely create the mother of all gamma/short squeezes.

**Upcoming Events**

Feb 12-16 - Spacex SN10 launches..spce usually trades as a proxy

Feb 13-18 - Virgin Galactic launches SS2

Feb 25 - Earnings report; we expect update on pricing + potential Boom acquisition

March - SS2 flight 2 and FAA approval

April - Ark Funds launches space etf 

April/May - Richard Branson goes to space

July+ -  Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber go to space. 

**Main Risks**

1) Rocketship breaks

2) the company continues to work at snail's pace

3) Increasing competition

**Conclusion**

As we note in the title, this is a WSB vs UBS story. When UBS downgraded SPCE yesterday, while simultaneously raising their price target to fair value, we shook our heads and asked how is this even possible? Does anyone really know what the world will look like in 10 years...let alone a space company? So in response, we are here to show them that we run our own models and have our own thoughts on Virgin Galactic. Let this be a message to the sell-side from WSB....while ""you try to add value, we straight up create it"" if you know, you know. Strap in ladies and gents, SPCE is about to go on a wild ride.

This is a company that I think would be a long term move - market cap of $20b - total revenue at over $2b - and some smart money makin moves in   the meantime, but I don't know SHIT

Definitely not a get rich quick type of ticker, but looks good for that smooth brain ride you all care about.

Generac  is the leading manufacturer in power backup and generation systems. They produce home and commercial backup equipment up to 2mw, as well as have lines of power-washers, snowblowers, and other motored chore equipment. They are the number one provider of their products in North America. Recently they have budded into clean energy with the Generac PWRcell, a competitor to the Tesla (simmer down) Powerwall with the option to choose different sizes at different price ranges (something Papa Elon's baby lacks). In November they announced they were taking over the Harley Davidson Roadhouse to create the Generac Power Stage at the Milwaukee World Festival , a popular venue for concerts and other performances (it's a new source of revenue but ik who the fuck cares).   Recently Generac also announced that they are opening a new production facility in South Carolina providing 450 jobs. This is to deal with the increase in demand and for larger production capabilities in the future. As more people work from home and extreme weather related power outages become increasingly frequent these backup systems are becoming critical to many households across the world.

On   top of all this the management is a bunch of Milwaukee bulls. Our boy Aaron Judgefield sits at CEO/President has worked at Generac for a whopping 26 years from an accountant all the to his current position as head hog. This All-American slab of ground beef will fuck your wife before you knew he threw you out of bed, and I trust he has a stake in the well-being of the company given his long history. Most of the top management has spent years at this company, and they've only made money   moves so you're choice.

In Q3 2020  Generac saw a 17% increase in sales, and beat expected EPS for the  5th  quarter in a row. This brought a 2020 net sales of $2.48 billion,  which  is up two billion from last year. GNRC did this while doubling  their  cash in hand from $322 to $655 million. Debt has only increased  slightly  for the amount of bills they're taking in. By 2026 the home  generator  market alone is estimated to be worth $7.6 with GNRC looking  to be the  top dawg among suppliers.

Current  ticker is at $326 (2/13), but price targets have been adjusted from under $250 to $360 by a few different firms (Goldman, JPMorgan, Roth, Oppenheimer). Average target $346 with the high hovering at $400. We don't talk about the low.

2/14/21 19:19,"Unga bunga unga bunga: At&t DD Reasons to buy T leaps/shares.

1. It’s HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated).
It’s quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings.

If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride.

2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real thing(if you subscribed to one, it's hard to think of anything else, kinda like display tech); unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch in 2030.

3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it’s mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).

4. It’s not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.

5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.

6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining.
One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.

Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.

7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.

8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.

9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.

Reasons not to buy leaps/shares.

1. It’s a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some FCF predictions which are absolutely ridiculous(one can make a serious DD with FCF calculation of TSLA with the revenue being equivalent to the GDP of Canada and FCF being something even more ridiculous).

That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividend, the stock would have to remain connected to reality. The meme that, ""invest for the 5% dividend, lose 10% in stock decline is kinda...""

2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.

3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am wrong.

4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.

7. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it’s negative or not, but it probably isn’t much.

*That's all.*

I think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play.",33029,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999574125,True

Digi assets provide sudden spikes due to its high volatility and can knock shorts suddenly making it risky. Can this be a new corporate defense? 

Company's balance sheet can also dip, but eps won't react as much. But if a company's balance sheet receives sudden spikes prior to quarterly earnings, this can be a consistent shakeoff throughout the year. Digi prices are transparent throughout. 

As a concept, why or why not? This is not a troll but conceptually can it work?

Also.. imagine if shorts are stacking, a prominent person or news can tweet to trigger price spikes and shake the leaves off a tree. It could work..its so hard to short on margin.

*please remember, these are WHALE plays. Follow the winners and cut the losers. High risk and high reward is what this is. If you are looking for the safe guaranteed growth stuff, grab some nice SPY leaps or something.*

Congrats to those who stayed with CCL and played the QS ER callout. Those tendies have staved off starvation for a night.  These are the reason we play. 

The PLTR rebound is indeed occurring with a boost from Cathie on CNBC as predicted. FUBO is also rebounding by strongly outperming the broader NASDAQ, and I expect continued performance with indices likely rebounding in the coming days. 

**FSLY calls are just absolutely fuk. Going to baghold some through ER as a Hail Mary.** Cant get much worse. Awful. I am ashamed. 

I am fine with the M price action for now. I am fine with VXX as it’s clearly needed rn. Trim a little each time it pops on VXX. 

I am holding off on that EV consideration for now except I opened a position in XPEV and NIO hoping post lunar new year buying will give us a little help in a beaten down industry. 2/26 ATM. TSLA has really turned it around today. 

Stay strong. Prayers up for the little homie FSLY 😭 

**2/17 PRE MARKET UPDATE**

The latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. 

For the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. 

Hope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues.

**Incorrect**:IV wasn’t enough to save a very shit day from FSLY— the DAQ was a whipsaw today, though, so that didn’t help. 

**Incorrect but frustrating** FUBO got an announcement today that Comcast was buying a 9% investment stake, institutional money continued flowing in, yet it tanked. I guess the shorts are too strong.

————————-

Hi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week. **Shoutout to Unusual Whales who I’ve spoken with and has given their blessing for me to provide these plays and screenshots. I recommend them bigly**

I monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim

I’ve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I’m giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. 

Been on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.

*The whale plays I am interested in:*

[FSLY 2/26 110c](https://i.imgur.com/U00vNOa.jpg)🚀 🚀 🚀 

I like this for two reasons.  **The first is simple**: I've seen repeat call flow into FSLY building up over the past two weeks, and it just can't sustain the pops yet.  It's a similar pattern I saw to the DKNG and NIO calls before their pops.  *Continued betting OTM by whales gives me more confidence with each slip, and pressure for an upward pop is building.*. **The second reason** is the dump after the NET ER.  I love when sympathy plays get oversold, because it's easy entry into their earnings run.  

**How I’m going to play it**: I'll follow the whale on a call spread up to 110 for 2/19, and ride it up until just before earnings Wednesday, then cut it.  Successful strategy I've been employing with tech earnings runs lately; last week I just closed my eyes and threw a dart at TWTR OTM calls and rode it up for about 100% the day of.  Sure, you miss out if earnings are a banger, but I have an increasingly strict no earnings rule.

**Earnins run= yes.  Holding through earnings= no**

[M 3/26 20c](https://i.imgur.com/ybj1GMB.jpg)🚀 🚀 🚀 

Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:

**1) The B of A BBBY upgrade**: [bulls are returning on BBBY now that the squeeze is over and their reasoning is strikingly similar to the M story](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-becomes-more-attractive-with-short-squeeze-over-b-of-a-says-11613076266).  Store closures?  Bullish.  Narrowly avoiding bankruptcy? Mega boolish.  But more importantly...
**2) Digital integration**: the CEO of M is actually a solid leader, and has really pushed the transition to digital and online merchandising.  I think this pivot will gain more spotlight headed into ER.

**How I’ll play it**: M is a super streaky stock that can give you 8% return multiple days in a row, but can also frustratingly do the opposite.  It also tends to really crater in the mornings before stabilization and rising late in the day.  I will give this manic whale a chance on the 3/26c, while also clutching a more reasonable 16c 2/26 into the ER.  I will cut the 3/26 20c at the first sign of multi-day trouble

[VXX 4/1 20c ](https://i.imgur.com/kmKd8NC.jpg) 🚀 😭 

I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and [here is a previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I did on how it works.  It is approaching absurd lows, fear and greed is rising, and all that other doomed shit you hear.  What really signals to me this is the time to expand this hedge is the potential for sector rotation (and the currently happening rotation).  **As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done--this is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

**How I’ll play it:** a VXX 16c 2/26 feels right to purchase on a Tuesday dip meant)


[CCL 3/12 25.5](https://i.imgur.com/zfdoec7.jpg)🚀 🚀 

Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.  *I understand and agree with the problems with travel right now: this is not an endorsement of the end of COVID, but I like the stock*, and I like the potential for upward movement.  I'll likely play this one as the whale has and exercise patience.  Has potential for wild swings, though, so keeping a close eye on this one.

**EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**🚗 🚀 

Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.  **QS and FSR got lots of attention after upgrades and into QS earnings, but the titans are positioned to explode after some from frustrating coiling**. NIO in particular lately has been moving slower than a white man in slippers.  TSLA is a pricey ass premium, so maybe consider focusing on NIO or call spreads.

**BONUS**: QS earnings could be when they finally reveal their revolutionary technology which prevents dendrites. This is the holy grail of EV battery production, and they boldly claim they have figured it out. The lawsuit is standard hot air from people upset their stock tanked in this weird ass meme of a market and I am unbothered. 

**WKHS dip feels like it was a blessing,** but I may wait for a little more dip on Tuesday because this thing is streaky as fuck.  People could be positioning into the Q2 (hopeful) EV deal announcement with the USPS.

[FUBO 2/26 42c and 2/19 56c](https://i.imgur.com/blCr0q3.jpg)🚀 🚀 

**EDIT: shoutout to /u/4p0rn0nly who pointed on that the 55c has a more favorable bid/ask spread and vol/OI. This is why I keep that inbox open!**

As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of ""My 600 LB Life"", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: 
Random twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn

**General theme I am seeing:**

*Call flow into into big tech has really, really dried up*.  I'm hoping this continues into next week, because then we could be in a really nice position to pick up some March and April monthlies in struggling behemoths like FB.  TWTR is doing it's thing, but it seems like the looming AAPL privacy concerns have put a stranglehold on other big tech companies relying on advertising data.

**Play I just like this week:**

[PLTR reports Tuesday Premarket](https://i.imgur.com/MkoiiWz.jpg) and I think there is a chance to hop on no matter the outcome.  Sells off because earnings these days are stupid?  Buy the dip.  Starts to rocket off some news or a beat?  Hop on.  PLTR feels like a win-win rn at this price point no matter the earnings report brings.

**Fellow Bulls beware:** 🐻 

Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.  [Quietly last month, the FED announced they were discontinuing the repo program; nobody noticed this but we had a huge dip that day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve’s%20decision%20to,term%20repos%20set%20for%20Feb.&text=Overnight%20repo%20operations%20will%20continue). Treasury yield also has been stubbornly climbing.  Long story short, these are caution flags for an outflow from stonks into stable long-term securities.  Not ringing the bear alarm, but just shit you should know.

I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)

**TLDR**: 

Tech calls drying up for the meantime, looks like the outflow could be headed to speculative sectors, particularly EV.  Potential DOW flight coming.  Hedge with VXX pretty heavily, and retail that is doing digital integration may get the proper spotlight now post-meme.

2/13/21 17:00,"$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

2/13/21 10:01,"CureVac (CVAC) making the coronavirus vaccine for Europoors and beyond I’m new, sort of. I joined a couple of years back and got turned off by all the rockets so I unsubscribed. I was reminded of WSB recently when I read a bestof post about someone who made enough money to pay for his dog’s surgery. WSB, making money? I got a flash back of all the rockets, of how I thought going long on Tesla was dumb, and cried inside when I compared to the stock price today. So I re-joined and promptly lost 2.5k with GME (my fault, got greedy). I regained it in weed plus a little extra, so we’re good. 



What to do with this fresh money?



I got curious about CureVac today as I read that they *“announced initiation of a rolling submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for CVnCoV, the company’s mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, currently in late-stage clinical testing.”* I looked into it, here are my notes: 



CureVac (CVAC) is German biotech with 20 years of experience but new on the stock market (IPOed in August 2020, current market cap 21.4bn).



They developed a COVID mRNA vaccine (similar to Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna) but the CureVac can be shipped and stored at fridge temperature, a major logistics advantage compared to the others. It’s cheaper to store and transport and can also be used in poor countries that don't have the kind of cold storage the other mRNA vaccines need.



The vaccine is currently in phase 3 testing—a U.K. trial has finished enrolling 15,000 participants, and another global phase 2b/3 study aims to recruit more than 35,000 volunteers. (They already know it works and it’s safe so far; in Phase 3 they’re assessing how well it works plus more safety data.)



CureVac is in collaboration with the UK Government (the UK will provide them with scientific data regarding new strains), Bayer (to scale production of its vaccine, 160m doses) and GSK (to produce 100m doses and to jointly develop second generation vaccines).



The European Commission already has an order in for 405 million doses. It gave CureVac €75 million in funding to develop CVnCoV, adding to around €300 million provided by the German government.

The UK ordered 50m doses.



CureVac and partners expect to produce up to 300m doses in 2021 and up to 600m in 2022.



Whenever a new variant of the virus emerges, they can make a vaccine “update” in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, they're collaborating with GSK to make the second generation of vaccines (i.e. multivalent vaccines that cover multiple mutations of the coronavirus or multiple respiratory viruses). Such vaccines could become available 2022 subject to regulatory approval.



Other developments in the pipeline: rabies vaccine, and a couple of injectable drugs for skin and lung cancers in Phase 1 clinical trials (preliminary tests in humans). 



**Financials**

Being a newly listed company, there’s not much data to go with. I only found the *Third Quarter and First 9 Months 2020 Financial Results* on their website and didn’t look further. There’s probably a German website where you can find past balance sheet information for the company, but my German sucks. So I only go with this one report I found (first link in the list of sources). I nearly failed my accounting exam and probably only passed it because I cried, you better read the report yourself if you know how to read.


Comparison between Q1-Q3 2020 vs the same period in 2019:

Revenue: 43m (2020) vs 11m (2019)

Net loss: -71m vs -64m (despite spending 46m more in R&D in 2020)

Obviously, these are numbers before they start selling the vaccine (assuming it passes Phase 3). Trying to look at the future, I couldn’t find any info on the vaccine pricing or how much profit they expect to make per dose. But they’ve *“ruled out selling its inoculation at cost, arguing instead for an “ethical margin” for shareholders.”*. Comparatively, *“AstraZeneca and J&J have said they would not seek to profit from their vaccines, at least during the pandemic. “*



They have €892 million in cash as of September 30th, 2020 (from the German govt, the deal with GSK, the IPO and the grant/loan from the European Investment Bank). 



Major shareholders include the founder, the German government and one of the founders of SAP.



Position: [1 x Jan2023 115C](https://imgur.com/a/mJcge6P). 

I’m an Europoor. I barely had the money to make this one call. I have no qualifications in finance or pharma. Don’t listen to me. Rockets.

2/13/21 08:09,"Continental Automotive has a lot of potential for a long term play (if I knew how to do emojis I would put them here) This is my first DD, and I'm a bit of a smooth brain so go easy on me.

I'm here to tell you why I think Continental Automotive (CTTAY) is a great play for the EV sector.

1. **What does Continental do?** Most people think of Continental Tires when they hear the name, however, Continental does way more than that. According to their 2019 investor presentation, Rubber only accounts for 40 percent of their sales. They are the number 3 automotive parts supplier globally. Continental has also acquired many tech companies over the past few years to prepare for the EV boom. They have acquired cybersecurity companies, AI software companies, and LIDAR and antenna companies. Not to mention their partnership with NVIDIA for computing power. Overall, just a great spread of technology.
2. **Covid recovery:** Continental was hit hard by Covid just like the rest of the automotive sector. Their stock pre-Covid was around $12 dollars, with it sitting around $30 2-3 years ago. The current stock price has been hovering around $14, so it recovered nicely however not nearly as much as the rest of the automotive sector has rebounded. Major players like F, HMC, GM, TSLA, TM, and others have all far surpassed their pre-Covid highs.
3. **EV, Autonomous Driving, and 5G:** Continental has their foot in the door with almost every major vehicle manufacturer, and most manufacturers are slowly converting to EVs. They also currently have a partnership with a Chinese EV company for an electric drive train. That being said, 5G is the most interesting thing that Continental has going for it in my opinion. They are developing a 5G network access device (their previous version of this is in a majority of cars on the road). This will allow quick access to the internet for vehicles on the road.
4. **V2X:** V2X is Vehicle to X communication. This includes vehicles communicating with other vehicles on the road, which many deem necessary for fully autonomous driving. This also includes vehicle to traffic signal communication, as well as anything else a vehicle may need to communicate with, hence V2*X*. This is something I see lacking in other EV companies like Tesla, (Musk is too stubborn to admit that V2X technology will be needed to actually have autonomous driving) Continentals 5G chips will enable their V2X software to be on as many cars as they want. (Also I'm not discrediting Tesla, I've heard that gets you downvotes on this sub. Please spare me Musk daddy and Grimes mommy)

Anyway, these are just a couple of things I found while reading through their Q3 2020 Financial report as well as their 2019 plans for the future. (linked below)

Like I said I don't really know what I'm doing, (especially with like earnings and valuations) but when I read through their literature (JK I CANT READ) it seems like a lot of really interesting tech and I believe the company is currently undervalued. Totally willing to be proven wrong by some dumb ass apes tho

2/13/21 05:13,"Oil Stocks - Summer 2021 Hey everyone! I understand that I may get bashed or called a boomer for this, but I would like to discuss the possibility of oil stocks making a recovery this summer. While the popular consensus is that clean energy is taking over (Teslas on the road, Amazon using electric trucks, fuel economy improvements, federal EV mandates, pipelines being banned, etc.), and I agree with this consensus long term (by 2030), I don't think oil is going anywhere in the short term.

Back in early November 2020, oil stocks started climbing their way back to their pre-covid averages, but most have not reached their pre-covid averages and some have almost 50% more to grow (such as Suncor or British Petroleum). My thought process is that with Covid vaccines rolling out/restrictions letting up, we will see increases in summer travel and an increase in manufacturing (which often requires oil). This paired with climbing oil prices will bring an increase in oil stocks in my opinion.

For a well thought out bull/bear thesis on oil see this post:

Another Canadian play. Another solid gold play. One to hold and enjoy the divvies but also feeling safe that you’re in at price levels that existed before we wasted our time in the Middle East.


 That play? Suncor. TSE: SU, NYSE: SU


You may be thinking, wow this is some slow ass dino-stock that I can’t meme on. However, fatty gains are pretty much guaranteed.


Why?


1.	Everyone (see: moron analysts) thinks that oil is dead. These fuckers sit around in their downtown condos, wearing Patagonia sweater vests and thinking that just because they don’t drive their compact german executive car as often to mom’s house, that no one is driving at all. Take a look at the suburbs you hedgie-tard, take a look at ASEAN, Asia, Africa etc. People are going to driving their cars (we’ve sold 60 mil+ a year for years, almost all of those are gasoline powered). No one in these meme times can afford a Tesla or a BYD shit box unless you made money on gamestop. Yea I made 100% flipping gamestop in a day, hold my bags. China lays 8000km of highway a year, you’re not going to power that kind of growth with a fucking battery pack Elon.


2.	The Russian vaccine cannot be underestimated. It’s 91% effective for normal cases and 100% effective against severe and moderate cases according to a study from the Lancet. Russia now has this vaccine produced in South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Pakistan etc. Only rich western countries can afford extended lockdowns, Russia has just liberated the developing worlds economies with a 10$ vaccine that can be stored in a fridge. For all intents and purposes, this pandemic is done. Russia has forced the hand of western supply chains if they want to make money. 


3.	Suncor has entered into agreements with Canadian government bodies to retrofit stations with EV charging ports. Suncor has >1800 stations in Canada. If they have to , they can easily pivot their stations into EV charging locations and with consumer presence of mind, everyone knows where their local petro Canada station is. Highly pivotable operations. Why would they let some eco-nerds start an EV charging chain on their soil? 


4.	There's nothing proprietary or mind blowing about EV charging companies, once the big boy gas companies step in, they're just going to install it in the stations that are already there.


5.	Good balance sheet, Warren buffet has been invested for a long time. But he bought the dip and recently sold his the shares he bought in 2020. He still has >13m shares, FMR bought about $500 million worth of Suncor in the last quarter. Strong free cash flow through gas stations (one place you can still go during the entire pandemic without masks, gloves or any requirements, been open for business this whole time).


6.	They can maintain dividends at WTI $35 according to their report, if WTI stays >55 this is a no brainer. Currently the market is pricing in about $55 wti so once the market prices in $60, on a DCF that makes the company worth $45.8B Canadian. 


7.	Geopolitics. Biden isn’t cancelling new drilling permits just because “DUDE SAVE THE PLANET MAN”. America not wasting its hydrocarbon stores is smart in case of a protracted conflict in the Pacific with China. Why ship oil in from the Saudis and Venezuela when you have a shit ton of shale safe in Texas. America is rich enough to have countries deplete their own reserves for America’s consumption and Canada is happy to help. The Keystone pipeline oil will just get shipped down on trains owned by Berkshire and Bill Gates (yea gates owns like 14% of CN rail and is the largest shareholder of that rail company, the more you know lol). The TMX pipeline is full steam ahead and will be completed by dec 2022. This completition will help shrink the gap between WCS and WTI and allow Canada to sell its oil all around the world. Suncor has committed to fill these pipes with its juice too.


8.	Our X-Factor. [This guy](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FF2LGW7EAU5O5FUGMDLZKTFU4E.jpg) did a giant tour around India and ASEAN promoting Canadian business. What is Canadian business? Mostly natural resources and finance lol. We’re going to sell our Oil Sands through the port of BC to developing Asian nations around the world and help them gain energy independence from China. Canada standing by ready to help keep the free-world, free. You think this guy went around the pacific just for fun? 


9.	The last quarter showed great cost management and shows that Suncor is looking after shareholder interests. Shareholder interest in this sector are no  longer about growing production capacity but about delivering value to shareholder through dividends and buybacks. Management has already started buying back shares and its just a matter of time before they reinstate the dividend to .42 cents a share….every quarter LOL


10.	Hedge against inflation. We’ve printed a shit ton of dollars and now people want to tell me that a barrel of oil (148L of oil, equal to 20-30 gallons of gasoline and 10-20 gallons of diesel) should only cost $60 usd? $60 usd? I shit on $60. $60 wont even get a Saudi prince the paint on his tomahawk missles. Fuck off with this fake scam money, commodities serve a specified purpose and their value is derived from that. 


11.	Marko Kolanovic, a quant at JPM who LITERALLY called the bottom of the corona market dump says were entering a new oil “supercycle”. If someone that smart and connect says it, then you don’t even need to listen to me anymore. Suncor was trading at 40$ cad before this pandemic came around, and it will again.


For all you cr*pto-morons, here: SU-coin is a limited quantity e-coin that returns you .21 to .42 cents  a quarter and each day grows its proportional share of Canada’s second largest oil producer through management buying coins and destroying them. Wow so cool.

I think if Biden is serious about decarbonization, nuclear energy is a must as solar/wind have trouble keeping the lights on when there's no sun/wind. Battery sure can help but at this stage, cars will starve the supply for energy storage as cars offer more bangs for the bucks for the battery manufacturers. The power outage over the past few days in TX for sure highlighted the need for some back up for wind/solar.

TBH, I haven't done extensive DD but just thinking about maybe there's a macro trend here. The charts look good and seem to be setting up a big wave after years of consolidation.

PS. I have roof top solar and a battery for a little more than a year (both bought from TSLA using the TSLA money I made, feels great back then, not so now as I ""loss"" a few hundred k because of this). My home was self-powered 52% during this time with solar generation in the day and battery supply during night. Sure I can put more panels and batteries to get this % higher but the marginal cost will increase sharply. At some point it gets stupidly costly. I think this is the same for the whole power grid. 100% renewable even with battery storage is just not good investment and having some more stable generation to pick up the slack in unfavorable weather will help out a lot.

If you follow my comments, I've been pretty bearish lately so I'm obviously always looking for my daily dose of confirmation basis. Blackrock is still overall bullish on the market and took a HUGE position on TSLA, I've also seen companies switch from bonds to shares of TSLA recently which may speak to a continuation.

Even though their call position on SPY is still larger than their put position, they increased their hedge by 12000% (basically nonexistent to very tangible) while their call position only increased a comparatively modest 52%

Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac  are two companies that are in conservatorship that have been retaining their earnings since September 2019.

&#x200B;

* Tesla’s net income in 2020 was $700 million. Fannie Mae is expected to exceed **$7 Billion**.
* Tesla has a market cap of $800 Billion. Fannie Mae has a **market cap of $2 Billion**.
   * Let that sink in for a moment. Fannie is 10X more profitable than the 5th largest company on the S&P500, yet only 1/400th of the value and trading OTC.
      * **Both $FNMA and $FMCC are less than $2!!! WTF!?**
      * What other companies trading in the OTC have quarterly earnings in the billions?
      * [Freddie Mac Nets $7.3 Billion in 2020, Strong 4Q](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/220515-strong-freddie-mac-nets-73-billion-in-2020-boosted-by-strong-4th-quarter?v=preview)

* The crime syndicate that is the US government is pulling off the biggest theft in the history of capitalism.
   * **I  own these stocks because I am fighting for what is right.  It is wrong for the government to hold these two public companies hostage; companies that never needed a bailout; companies that have already paid back the money they were forced to take.**
   * There are also UNSEALED documents showing the mafia-style bailout, which is evidence in the SCOTUS case.
* I think most people don't know about the 12/9/2020 SCOTUS case questioning a bid by shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pursue legal claims arising from the government’s rescue of the mortgage finance firms following the 2008 housing crisis. Yes, the case went to the supreme court! **Less than 100 days until SCOTUS decision.**
   * If we are lucky, then the ruling will come out before June 9, 2021.
      * The ""June"" date is set as the end-date of the summer adjournment; they should, probably will, clear their slate and pronounce before heading out.
      * Seems like April 1st is a middle-ground - they will of course be hearing cases in Feb, Mar, April, etc and those would get cleared out, as well.
      * Bottom line: Shorts do not have until June to play games. Longs can't be on the sidelines thinking nothing-happening until then either. **It could happen literally any day now.** 🚀🚀
      * Here is a [good summary of the SCOTUS arguments for the Collins vs Mnuchin case](https://www.lawfareblog.com/supreme-court-hears-oral-argument-collins-v-mnuchin)
* Fannie has a P/E and it’s less than 1. The company’s fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $4.6 billion, or $18.40 billion annualized. As of December 31, 2020, Fannie had 1.158 billion shares of common stock outstanding, but Treasury also holds warrants for another 4.6 billion shares, resulting in 5.76 billion fully diluted shares outstanding. Fannie’s fourth quarter earnings per share (annualized) thus are $3.19, which at today’s common stock price at this moment of $1.92 makes for a for a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 0.60...

2/16/21 03:26,"Thoughts on Stonks: A rendition of George Carlin **# of times mods have taken this down so far: 1**

A tribute to George Carlin's thoughts on germs (stonks) in America.

&#x200B;

They can fuck with you anytime they want. As long as you put up with it which means of course anytime they want because that's what Americans do now. They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling--the *illusion* of security. What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and stonks.

There's another thing: stonks.

&#x200B;

Where did this sudden fear of stonks comes from in this country? Have you noticed this? The media constantly running stories about all the latest stonks. Tesla, Hertz, AMC, Gamestop. And Americans they panic easily so now everybody is running around buying this and selling that and cutting their gains short and repeatedly listening to the news to avoid all contact with stonks.

It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths. In prisons before they give you a lethal injection they ask if you want to sell your GME. That's true.

Well they don't want you to lose any more money. And you can see their point. Wouldn't want some guy to go to hell and be poor. Would take a lot of the sportsmanship out of the whole execution.

Fear of stonks...why these fucking pussies. You can't even find a decent YOLO anymore. They FUD the shit out of everything now and everybody's afraid of losing.

Hey where's your sense of adventure? Take a fucking chance will you? You know how many people lose all their tendies every year? 9,000 that's all. It's a minor risk! Take a fucking chance bunch of goddamn pussies.

Besides what do you think you have diamond hands for? They're for holding stonks! But they need practice. They need stonks to practice on.

So listen, if you ignore all the stonks around you and live a completely sterile life then when the FUD comes after whatever you're holding you won't be prepared. And never mind ordinary FUD. What are you going to do when some super virus FUD comes along that turns your portfolio into liquid shit? I'll tell you what you're going to do--you're going to panic and you're going to sell at a loss. And you're going to deserve it because you're fucking weak and you’ve got fucking weak paper hands.

Alright, let me tell you a true story about the stock market okay. When I was a little boy in New York City we gambled everything we had on pennystocks that were going bankrupt. Okay? We spun the roulette wheel and put it all on 21, you know just because? And at that time the big fear was a market crash. Thousands of kids lost their tendies to market crashes. But you know something? In my neighborhood no one ever lost anything to a market crash. NO ONE! EVER! You know why? because we YOLOED ON PENNYSTOCKS. It strengthened our diamond hands; the market never had a prayer! We were tempered in raw FUD!

So, personally I never take any special precautions against stonks.

I don't shy away from people who spread fear and uncertainty.

I don't listen to anything on TV.

I don't listen to friends or family.

I don't take advice from billionaries.

And if one of my stonks drops 50% I double down and buy more of it. Even if the company is just a sidewalk cafe in *Calcutta*. The *poor* section. On New Year's morning during a soccer riot.

And you know something? In spite of all that so-called risky behavior...I never have losses.

I don't get them.

I don't get paper-hands.

I don't get FOMO.

I don't get stressed.

I don't buy into FUD.

You know why? Because I got good strong diamond hands and they get a lot of practice.

My diamond hands are equipped with SEC company updates, google trend indicators, and HQ sentiment analysis. And we have recently acquired positive EMA, daily supertrend, VWAP, and MACD. So when my BUY buttons are on patrol reconnoitering the market seeking out bankrupt companies and other undesirables...if they see any, ANY suspicious-looking stonks of any kind they don't fuck around. They whip out the DD, they buy the motherfucker, and deposit the unlucky stonk directly into my portfolio. Into my portfolio. There's no nonsense. There's no Miranda warning. There's none of that three strikes and you're out bullshit. First offense BAM into the portfolio ya go.

Oh and speaking of my portfolio I want you to know I don't automatically downsize a stock once its taking up a large % of my portfolio. Okay? Can you deal with that? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. You know when sell my stonks? When I have to buy other stonks! That's the only time. And you know how often that happens? Tops TOPS...two maybe three times a week TOPS. Maybe a little more frequently before the holidays you know what I mean?

And I'll tell you something else my paper-handed friends. You don't always need to trade every day. Did you know that? It's overkill. Unless you work at a firm, or have 10 monitors at your disposal, or for some reason come in intimate contact with huge amounts of FUD and FOMO every day... you don't always need to trade.

I appreciate it thank you.

Everyone knows “Ford” there’s rumors a merger with Tesla but I don’t think it would ever happen the brand “Ford” is like Disney to famous be acquired but it’s a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Seriously go google Mache-e.

The new Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy company and brands which = consumer loyalty. Has factories in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!🚀🚀🚀🚀

""Yup, Ford has all that, plus:

* A 500 billion dollar investment and partial ownership of Rivian, a member of the Ford family on Rivian's board of trustees, and a partnership with Rivian to be able to use Rivian's skateboard (R1T, R1S) platform.
* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.
* Owns SPIN, the scooter company.
* Massive ICE F-150 profits instead of Tesla shareholders and tax credits to fund their EV and autonomous plans.

2/15/21 07:24,"(USA) The Tax Man Cometh - Updates on YOLO / FD big gains Okay.  I made some money on things like TSLA, but I'm a long, am totally gay for Elon, and I've been on here watching y'all awhile.  I haven't done much of the retarded stuff I've read on here (certain option strategies) but might dabble in that a bit.  But with all the recent stuff on everyone's favorite crappy video game store, I'm really curious about some followups.  

For example, if some guy FD'd and made $600,000 in a single bet, awesome.  But that was last year.  Now it's 2021, and it's too late to do anything to affect your 2020 income taxes, except contribute to and IRA (oh, but guess what - you can't even do that because you made too much money).

A long investor doesn't pay income taxes on unrealized gains, but someone who makes $600K on options now suddenly finds themselves in the >35% tax bracket.  I know the math doesn't work exactly this way with tax brackets, so don't bother correcting me in the comments.  I'm in the 35% tax bracket. I know how brackets work.  🤣

Anyway, assuming someone made multiple 6-digit gains last year.  Like many of us on here, this guy is an amateur investor.  I'm assuming he doesn't geek out on tax stuff.  I'm just GUESSING that he might not have the $100k - $200k in tax to pay the tax man.  I'm (again guessing) that he's taken all of that money and rolled it into his next strategy.

I'm really REALLY curious to see some receipts on that.  What's the followup?  You made $X and then the tax man comes asking for $Y. 

What was THAT like?  Anyone have receipts?  I'm guessing there are some ""OH YEAH"" followed by ""OH NO"" stories.

2/15/21 06:34,"Celebrate Chinese New Year with PUTS on $NIO & $XPEV, Wish Me Luckin Every time I see another pump article on the “next Chinese Tesla” because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, “NIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!” comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it’s cold AF outside.

So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG & LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don’t like these stocks.

**1. Positions**

[https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.

A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.

**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO & XPENG**

Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.

Current PS as of 2/10/2021

\- TSLA: \~25

\- NIO: \~40

\- XPENG: \~41

\- LI: \~19 (It’s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)

Let’s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let’s look at high margin tech anyways.

\- NFLX: \~10

\- ABNB: \~28

\- PLTR: \~72 (peter pan stock)

Actual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma’s teets

\- TM: \~0.8

\- F: \~0.4

\- VWAGY: \~0.5

I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don’t ask me how I did that, the answer either won’t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what’s important right now.

Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn’t change

\- TSLA: \~22

\- NIO: \~29

\- XPENG: \~26

\- LI: \~14

Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct >20% because of some black swan (I mean it’s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king’s girlfriend.

Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.

Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.

**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**

You might be one of those Stocktwats and you’re thinking; “but but... they’ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!” \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won’t and here is why.

Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They’re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn’t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.

Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you’re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug’s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.

TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you’re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?

NIO: 100% SUVs

Xpeng: 40% SUVs

Brand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking “Well, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.” Fine, let’s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.

Let’s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs

Tesla Model Y- Price: \~$52,800

\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s

\- Charger network: 20,000+

NIO EC6

\- Price: \~$57,200

\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \~$9k for a bigger battery)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s

\- Charger network: 290+

Xpeng G3 520

\- Price: \~$30,580

\- Range: 520 km

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s

\- Charger network: 866+

You may be thinking the G3 520’s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you’ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.

“But JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It’s perfect for China’s dense cities!” If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That’s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I’d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can’t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I’m Chinese and know some first hand) don’t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.

Back to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book.

Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla’s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.

“But JJ… China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!” Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.

Solar & batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn’t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.

Oh and let’s not forget about autonomy… no, let’s forget about it (for now).

International expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a ""made in china"" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.

Back to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it’ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.

**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**

History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was ""made in china"" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).

Let’s look at the current state of margins.

Q3 2020 Gross Margins

\- Tesla: 23.5%

\- Nio: 12.9%

\- Xpeng: 4.6%

\- Li Auto: 19.8%

We’ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it’s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla’s solar & battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \[redacted\] at $400.

“But JJ, that’s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!” First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier “ramp” years.

2017: 18.9%

2016: 22.8%

2015: 22.8%

This may not look right, something must be wrong you’re thinking. Well, let’s we take a look under the hood, you won’t find Trayvon Martin.

\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the “skateboard” design, saying it’s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!

\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.

Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.

\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron’s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.

\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.

\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources

\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network

\- Connectivity: Startlink? \*shrugs\*

\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn’t trust Nio and Xpeng’s software with your wife’s boyfriend’s life

**5. Closing**

Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let’s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?

CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.

I’m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it’s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I’ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.

At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I’ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.

TL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto",33508,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999065816,True

Nothing has changed with Tesla other than two more giga-factories coming online this year and possibly launching the very first Semis along with the Cybertruck. Not only that, Tesla will potentially produce more vehicles in 2021 than over the entire life of Tesla.

2/18/21 04:33,"XRX - The Boomer Play You Didn't Know You Wanted - 2.17.21 Why Xerox, Inc

I know what you’re thinking “XRX, a dated and otherwise antiquated printing company that’s sold at Office Max to boomers”. Let me explain why that is no longer and will no longer be their company or business model. This also is not a “TeSlA iS NoT a Car COmpAny”... they are very much still and will remain an office supplies and office infrastructure company. It’s more an evolution regarding execution and forward thinking implementations coupled with strong management that’s been time tested.

Let’s begin with this excerpt from their most recent 8-K posted on 1/26/21:

“The Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) has been central in advancing the company’s innovation portfolio including 3D Printing and Digital Manufacturing, IoT Sensors and Services, and Clean Technology. Xerox installed its first 3D printer for a client in December, and IoT solutions are at work with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and other clients.”

And then let’s use PRNT by Ark Investments as a canvas for observing 3-D printing, and IoT printing as a future prospect. Also, PRNT gives us an idea of the market's “readiness” for pricing these assets.

PRNT

**1 Month** 7.92%

**3 Months** 31.45%

**YTD** 40.18%

**1 Year\*** 40.18%

**3 Years** 9.22%

**Since Inception** 11.47%

\*Take the 1YR performance with a grain of salt as the **broad market is up roughly \~30%...**

Look who’s in PRNT’s holdings “XEROX HOLDINGS CORP XRX UN 30,338 shares 726,595 mkt price” taken from PRNT’s holdings… linked here [https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/THE\_3D\_PRINTING\_ETF\_PRNT\_HOLDINGS.pdf](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/THE_3D_PRINTING_ETF_PRNT_HOLDINGS.pdf)

It’s clear that we are dealing with a company that is primed and ready to make a claim on the 3-D printing, and IoT for office. Given their infrastructure already in place from being a legacy brand with legacy clients... I firmly believe they will capitalize on the market.

Lastly, and this is the kicker, Carl Ichan has recently up’d his stake in the company. He is building a long position and I frankly have no problem riding with him.

2/18/21 02:35,"Tesla Will Acquire GE - Long Tesla, Boo Boeing **TLDR**

Tesla will buy GE. Tesla will be a direct competitor with Boeing and Airbus while capturing 25% of the market. GE will remain under pressure despite recent gains and Tesla will continue at a beautiful rate despite a few short term dips due to share offerings to generate additional capital. I predict Tesla has $50+ billion in offerings in 2021.

**Storytime**

It really grinds my gears when I see analysts pontificate about how Tesla’s market cap is bigger than all the other car companies combined. I will say it now, so these ignoramuses get it through their thick skull (and through their helmets), “Tesla is not a car company and Elon Musk is not like Henry Ford”. Here is the actual comparison you need to know and allow to be burned into your skull:

Elon Musk is the modern day Thomas Edison (and I wouldn’t put it past Elon to electrocute an elephant to put people on Mars)

If anyone knows the history of Edison, he wasn’t so much an inventor as he was a main of industry, optimizing, building and yes, inventing along the way. I urge all my tri-state autists to venture to West Orange, NJ and visit the Thomas Edison National Park. - [Thomas Edison National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)](https://www.nps.gov/edis/index.htm)

We are living and breathing modern history watching this brilliant kid smoke some hashish with Joe Rogan, all the while sending people to space. For anyone who can read here, I highly recommend the Ashley Vance book. For those who are actually able to procreate with someone, you’ll be telling your grandkids about him 50 years from now. Although, the majority of you will never see your grandkids because the only offspring you provided were generated from your sperm bank deposits since you needed the money for GME shares. [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future: Vance, Ashlee: 9780062301253: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/006230125X)

Bottom line, Elon’s goal is simple, get to Mars because we’re going to “F” up this planet. In order to blast off and settle somewhere else, we need transportation and energy, of which Elon has been hyper-focused. He’s got the SpaceX thing down pretty well. He has the individual shuttling down pretty well with Tesla. The energy side of things is ready to explode as the battery technology moves into the next phase. What we haven’t seen is intercontinental travel. I’ll talk about that further down.

**Why GE**

To start, it was Edison’s original company. There is nostalgia that Musk prefers to carry through and likely why he won’t move the entirety of SpaceX away from Cape Canaveral. Even though nostalgia will play a role, it isn’t enough to acquire a $95 billion market cap company. The main reason why GE is a prime target versus a Boeing is because GE is general aviation and energy, with significant downside pressure coming from years of epic failures in leadership. Musk would have been a Jack Welch fan (don’t listen to Suzy as she simply milked whatever fame should could from Jack’s teat and is now a memory at best).

But seriously, why buy a behemoth of corporate bureaucracy that hasn’t seen any substantial growth since the 90s. Well, my friends, cronyism….and long term capital contracts that have tentacles into the nation’s energy complex and aviation networks. While this fireside chat won’t go into the $400 billion in annual electricity spending (US only), this would likely comprise about $100-150 billion if taken to a global level for Tesla capturing 20-30%. [table3.pdf (eia.gov)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table3.pdf)

Why lean into energy faster with GE??? Those damn Chinese. You might have seen some NIO, LI, XPEV and a multitude of others bubbling up on this channel. The infrastructure is needed to support them as well as communist overlords trying to take over the world. These overlords are doing everything they can to get the hell away from coal (not because they are hippies) because they hated wearing masks in Shanghai and Beijing when there wasn’t the Rona. Battery technology represents a long-term growth investment to reduce their overall costs and seeing they keep pulling away from the world politically, they need to be sustainable without help, not even with Russian nat gas.

Battery expansion will only accelerate the more the technology is used en masse. Given the aviation and infrastructure levels not yet tapped into, along with government budgets (works for SpaceX), these two segments are ripe for explosive growth. The biggest headwinds will be discussed with the aviation side in a sec. Needless to say, EV cars are exciting, but batteries are the single key which gets both conservatives and liberals to full chub. The militia types save money with cheaper energy and the flower child gets their green energy. By buying the rights that the GE connections have with governments, will accelerate their growth into them.

**Aviation Domination**

Everyone right now: “Seriously, you’re a blowhard and took forever to get to this”

Me: “You have a point but I don’t know how to take a vacation and still feel compelled to type out long, extraneous things in order to make myself appear smart”

Everyone: “The helmet with your name on it suggests you may need to go back to playing with blocks”

I digress. Aviation, the real play here. Boeing and Airbus can suck it. Any company that has a backlog of work that spans 5-10 years, is screaming “I trade hookers and blow for favors from politicians and CEOs”. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the capital expense needed to manage through limited demand for highly capital intensive work is a potential for that, however, the same was said about NASA. The price to send someone to space on the shuttle was around $450-500 million. The price for SpaceX to do it, $90-150 million. When Boeing’s average plane costs $85 million on average (without any domestic competition), you know there is room for potential. Let’s break some numbers down:

*Boeing 737 Max Numbers*

Average price: $99MM (rounded) [• Boeing aircraft prices 2020 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273941/prices-of-boeing-aircraft-by-type/#:~:text=The%20Boeing%20737%2D700%2C%20listed,ones%20on%20Boeing%27s%20price%20list.)

Average Zero Fuel Weight: 138K (think passengers, baggage and minimum fluids/gas)

Average Takeoff Weight: 177K [Boeing 737 Max - Modern Airliners](https://modernairliners.com/boeing-737/boeing-737-max/)

*Tesla Model 3*

Average price: $40K (rounded)

Average weight: 4.5k

Average battery weight: 1k

Assuming we are looking at a 4:1 or 5:1 total weight-to-battery weight ratio, it would carry over into 40-45 batteries of capacity. There would likely be fuel still needed for initial takeoff due to thrust concerns, as well as backup for any emergency or corrective maneuvers requiring more thrust in order to conserve battery capacity. By the time production would take place, we could anticipate even further reductions on battery weight and power output which would further extend ranges. This would equate to being able to build an airplane for under $3-5MM. Given the loss of production efficiency without a true assembly line, it would hover on the higher end of the threshold.

Between vertical integration and the sheer backlog of more than 12k planes available to capture, not to mention the projected doubling of commercial aircraft demand in the next 10 years, simply matching Boeing and Airbus production would push revenues around $35-50 billion selling the Tesla planes at half the price of Boeing. If they expanded production to capture 25% of share of production over the next 10 years, you’re looking at nearly $350 billion.

Papa Elon is planning to bring people to Mars and will require interstellar transportation beyond 2-4 people each time on the Falcon Heavy. He is likely designing transport that allows for passengers in the hundreds beyond his Starship planning. The transition of moving scalable transportation fits into the aviation front. The only thing missing at this point are wings.

**How the hell is he going to pay for this?**

Tesla stock will hit $1000 this year. Heck, it may even get up to $2000. My money is on the former. During the continued meteoric rise, Elon will continue to offer more shares to further build the war chest. In the event of a GE takeover, he will do what Salesforce did. He will likely retain 20-30% of the newly acquired war chest and utilize shares for the remainder. The plan would be to sell off GE Healthcare (\~$20 billion annual revenue) to a Philips or J&J and use that sale to offset a good chunk of the initial purchase. GE may hit $100 billion in market cap this year, but only because of this value shift from some of the tech sector. It will likely depress, to fall back into a trading range that isn’t overly speculative. (Not financial advice in any way, so CYA, lol)

Also, the reason why this is important, it shuts up every freaking analyst about Tesla being a car company. They can never talk about market caps for Toyota or what Hyundai is doing. It makes no sense because this stock has not traded as a car company for the past year. They need to shut up. It will put short term pressure on Tesla in the short term as is being seen with CRM and the Slack acquisition. One thing for certain, no one has come to say how stupid CRM and WORK are together, only how they are going to be a force to be reckoned with once fully integrated. While stock in the short term is finding its path, the future is going to be incredible.

**What should you do now?**

As with my other DD and hopefully future ones provided I don’t get the ban stick or I lose wifi privileges, I want to try to put things on people’s radars. Tesla looks like a buy at these levels, despite the swings we’re going to see. GE though, meh. Tesla is building a war chest, like Apple, to accelerate development, through talent and technology acquisition. I foresee the biggest acquisitions that take place next year come from those two in a race for EV dominance. The China story, while exciting the past few months, will have headwinds with regulation, national defense concerns, and a blowing wind of political appetite which is about as easy to predict as the weather tomorrow from your local meteorologist. If China wants to play nice with the US, trademark protection becomes a big issue, and XPEV is the first to get blown off their pedestal.

~~The other major catalyst is a Democratic sweep next week. While expect some pull back on a Republican win for both, either scenario will push things higher, but a Democratic sweep is not fully priced in.~~ Additionally, any significant spike in oil prices this year (a second recession will keep them lower) will further propel EVs in the spotlight. Imagine the EV conversation with $100 barrels of oil. I am still surprised how powerful it has been at $40.

There will be a moment this year that Tesla’s focus moves beyond cars in the public forum. The only way for them to continue this growth trajectory given the competitive forces popping up are to attack competitors that think they have a monopoly. Ask Lockheed and Northrup Grumman how they’re feeling about their margins in the past couple of years since SpaceX came. The same is going to happen with Aviation (and potentially electrical grid competitors such as Nextera and PSEG.

And if Tesla does get into aviation, Boeing and Airbus are going to be under heavy pressure. The airlines would likely benefit heavily, but that would not be truly realized for a few years as infrastructure planning and adoption will take time.

Cheers gents (and ladies)!

2/18/21 01:23,"Welcome to the Boomer EV play Fucking Ford $F EDIT: [This right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/lcaepi/ford_vs_ferrari_part_1_greasing_the_wheels/) is far far far superior to my ramblings. Please look at that for more, but as always, do your research you Ape.

Alright here is the deal and I'm gonna tell ya. Everything right now is EV this, EV that, oooh heres a Lucid and theres a Lion, look at that NIO and wow what a Tesla! But what about the boomer version, what about the big money, classic company, total run up play of the EV market. Well I think its Ford and here are my reasons why:

Disclaimer: Blah blah not financial advice, blah blah do your own DD, blah blah don't trust random internet strangers for financial advice ya retard.

1. Right now Ford's Market Cap is just shy of $46 Billion. This is the Fourth largest automaker in the world in 2019 sorted by revenue. In other words, they are a big boy, they make cars, they've been doing it for over 100 years now, they know their shit. But still, they don't get much credit. Ford is often labeled the second biggest car company in America and never talked about. Why? They stale. You don't have to tell me they are boring, that's why I labeled this a boomer EV company. You invest in Ford for the dividend, because its stable, a high cap that's ole reliable. But here I'mma tell yew wat, that's changing. And the fact its perceived that way and is actually changing is gonna mean big big investment. Lets get to it.

Ford has a new CEO and his name is Jim Farley. Now this guy isn't the guy that's set the stage so far, and we will talk about that, but this guy has some unique energy.  In the last earnings call for GM and the one for Ford, they essentially reported the same thing. 4th quarter numbers were surprisingly good, company still lost some money, we are going to improve bottom line in 2021. But man oh man were the results different. Jim got on that phone and talked about taking warranty costs down and making 2021 a focus on tightening up the company even more, and boom the stock went up. I didn't even listen to the GM call, but the highlights were practically the same, and GM took a hit. The difference speaks for itself. Now if you want something of a character model for Jim but you are too lazy to look up and listen to video of him, just imagine Jim Farley as the modern day Tommy Boy (because you know... his cousin was Chris Farley.... who played Tommy Boy.... fucking young twats go watch the movie its hilarious!). He is determined to make Ford GreAT AgAIn!

2) Now some comparisons. As we all know, Tesla's fundamentals don't matter. But the idea here is that if Ford starts announcing money moves, its fundamentals will stop getting in the way! First off, the most relevant brands to compare here are going to be Tesla and Rivian, why? Model Y and the R1T are what Ford will be directly competing against first. And I'm going to break out the R1T first.

Lets face it. Everyone that is reading this post has touched, seen, ridden in, or at least heard of the F-150. It is the most recognized and biggest single vehicle brand in the world. GM can occasionally make and sell more trucks then the F-150, but they have to do it under two brands (Chevy and GMC). Ford tried making a luxury F-150 under Lincoln, but it didn't sell as well as just making a luxury F-150 (think platinum editions). Why does this matter? Ford is going to make an electric F-150. This has been a rumor for so so so long, but the massive investment in Rivian and the latest confirmations have shown that Ford has put a lot of effort into developing an acceptable electric drivetrain for the F-150. Now lets look at the R1T that will be the direct competitor. Rivian is expected to IPO soon and is looking to get an initial evaluation of $50 billion. Oh wait, what's that? An EV company that is launching with 1 or 2 models wants to be a $50 billion company? And Ford is going to compete in that space with a similar product and is only currently a $46 billion company? Hmmmmm.... If the electric F-150 is teased in September and it is at all competitive with R1T that alone should double the stock value. Ford would be gaining a whole new set of customers with a stronger brand name and already established manufacturing base and quality, and they wouldn't need to fight the uphill battle of trying to get into Tesla's well established brand and market of small and luxury EVs, they are getting into EV pickups the same time as everyone else! This is arguably the biggest reason I think the stock is going to double this year, but it needs proper setup to truly understand the potential.

3) Lets work back up the time line here. Ford can't just bust onto the scene with an electric F-150 and expect to take the cake and eat it too. Big boomer name auto companies are viewed as old and unmoving, they can't make changes, as someone I know tries to explain to me, ""Its suCH a BiG boAT Its gOInG to TAkE FoRevER to CHanGE CoUrSe!."" What they fail to realize is that Ford has been making moves to switch it up for years. What did they result in? Why the Mustang Mach-E of course.

The Mach-E is currently one of the most polarizing vehicles in the American vehicle enthusiast communities right now. You gotta understand. Ford made it through years of selling lackluster (in my opinion dogshit) Mustangs on the name alone! It has an image, a brand, that carried the full lineup even when Mustangs were slow and didn't know how to make power and meet emissions (or be fun). And that branding means anything with the Mustang name attached should be a two seater coupe with power and loud, dirty, gas powered bad boy image behind it. Ford could have made the Mustang Mach-E a new model, they could have made it its own thing and launched it as a new EV, the start of a new era or some other friendly bullshit. But instead Ford said, ""we need eyes on this thing and we need to make a point with it. What should we do?"" and the one guy in the room who didn't give a fuck anymore said, ""Well call it a Mustang, that'll do it."" And the fucking Chads did it! What's GM's big EV at the moment? The bolt, which they already burnt the branding on with dumb looks and weird commercials, and the Hummer, oh great a dead brand for people who need you to know they have a big swinging dick maybe. Ford is showing that they have the willingness to leverage their most recognized brands to launch a new EV image of the company. That's huge! And if the Mach-E does well, performs good, and gives a good impression to the car media people, that will be the real proper setup for the electric F-150. Especially since it can be compared directly to the Model Y. It'll be Ford vs Tesla, and all Ford has to do is go the 12 rounds, they don't even really have to win.

4) So now we get into the boomer money and how its going to set this thing off. Now I know I talked about our favorite boomer auto CEO Jim Farley, but lets talk for a second about everything that's happened before he got there. Ford is exiting the sedan and car market in North America. Why? It doesn't make money. Why is Ford so concerned about making big money. Aside from it being a company, well its balance sheet doesn't look too good. Is it horrible? Meh, the Debt to Equity is still horrendous, but the rest of it isn't bad per se. Ford has been trimming and fine tuning its production for years to get out of the debt it took on during the financial crisis and the last thing they wanted to do was retool everything to make EVs. But despite having a ridiculous ratio they've snuck investing in EV, battery tech, charging tech, and autonomous into the budget over the years. And Jim is taking over and immediately talking about reducing warranty costs and on hand inventory and things, the traditional stuff that hits Ford's operating bottom line. This is great! Improve profitability, that's what boomer and institutional investment love to hear. So, do we think the stock could go down? Well, look at the bears, the short interest in the float is super super super low, something around 1-2%. No one thinks this stock is going lower. And that's a good thing. It means almost everyone in Ford is in it as an investment and those buys aren't going anywhere. And it means, this is the entry point, it takes off from here. As Ford starts to come up and we see a steady rise over this year more and more institutional money and boomer retail will get in for the value growth.

5) As for gas. This is part of why I think Ford is a great all around sentiment change value investment. For years Ford has been releasing fun cars with the intent to rejuvenate the brand like the Focus RS and the Fiesta, but they were niche vehicles that still tried to be economic and whose base trims were still normal and boring. But it wasn't until recently that they have started to blatantly play into the enthusiast's desires in an attempt to build rep with actual car people again. Look at the Mustang GT350, GT350R, GT500, the Bronco, the new F-150 Raptor R. These aren't attempts to make a ""Green and eco friendly lineup"" no no no these are blatant fan favs that people have been screaming for for years! And branding is everything. And when you can already make bombass cars like these, people tend to trust you to make other things like that electric commuter car you really need.

6) Finally we get to the last and arguably the biggest reason this stock could pop off. Fleet vehicles. Ford controls around 40% of the fleet vehicle market. Think about that. All those companies that need fleets of vehicles that you can think of, 2 out of 5 are Ford supplied. I personally work at a company that uses fleet vehicles as a perk for the upper management and you know what they all have? Ford F-150s. About 12 of them parked in a nice little row in the parking lot. And you know whats weird about that? The next row is of normal employees that want to be like management, and my beat to hell Dodge Ram from 20 years ago stands out like a sore thumb between another nice little row of pretty new F-150s. Its a weird effect, but my point being fleet vehicles is a huge market, and when they start going electric, Ford will be poised to take up even more market share. Not only will Ford be able to pick up sales from fleet vehicles, but Ford already offers electric transit vans, you know, the kinda vans that do last mile stuff like install your cable, or DELIVER YOUR AMAZON PACKAGES. Yeah, those types of vans. Fleets of those will be going electric soon. And government contracts? Oh you better believe Ford is gonna get its share of those through the Green new deal. Fucking A is it.

7) And now we get into the latest and greatest stuff. Ford is investing in building electric where electric is going to sell well with a huge investment in Germany. But this also means that they think they can make more money competing directly against Tesla in Europe as well. Now that's confidence considering how crowded the EV market is in Europe already. But also, Ford keeps making money moves in the EV space and really focusing on building an EV side of the company instead of trying to transition its Gas side. This is good, it means that they hope to add value as opposed to transition it which is what will blow the roof off the market cap!

Anyways, thats what I got. Its not great and I can talk for hours, but its an honest opinion.

TL;DR Fuck you, that took a long time to write! Electric F-150, Mustang Mach-E, Ford not afraid to leverage its biggest brands, electric transit vans, fleet contracts, government contracts, exciting gas powered cars like GT350,GT500, Bronco, Raptor R, new Chad of a CEO Jim Farley who is modern day Tommy Boy, Improving fundamentals that Boomers care about, and coming out the gates this year swinging for Tesla. Also Rivian is gonna IPO for more than Ford is worth?

Is this where you put emojis or is it supposed to be the title? 🚀🚀🚀🤷‍♂️

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-17-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to open flat after Dow closes at another record

> * U.S. stock futures were steady Wednesday as Wall Street remained on track for its best monthly performance since November. A mixed session Tuesday saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average close at another record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke their two-day winning streaks with small losses, falling from previous session record high closes.

> * On Wednesday’s economic calendar, the Commerce Department is set to issue January retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect a 1.2% increase after a 0.7% December decline. At the same time, the Labor Department’s January look at producer prices is seen rising 0.4% after a 0.3% gain in December.

*****

> # 2. B/itcoin soars to new high, topping $51,000 for first time

> * B/itcoin smashed through $51,000 to hit a new all-time high Wednesday. Major financial companies appear to be warming to b/itcoin, while Tesla and other firms have also shown support for the c/ryptocurrency. B/itcoin’s latest rally is reminiscent of its massive ascent to nearly $20,000 in 2017, which was followed by an 80% plunge the following year. However, the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency did stage a fierce comeback since, more than quadrupling in 2020 and gaining over 70% since the start of this year.

*****

> # 3. Here are Warren Buffett-run Berkshire’s stock moves last quarter

> * Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought stakes worth $4.1 billion in Chevron and $8.6 billion in Verizon shares during the fourth quarter, according to the conglomerate’s latest 13-F filing with the SEC. Berkshire also sold its stakes in drug maker Pfizer and JPMorgan Chase, while trimming its Wells Fargo position. While still its biggest holding, Berkshire continued to trim its lucrative Apple stake, cutting it by about 6%. Four times a year, investors file their long positions with the government. The information is released to the public 45 days after each quarter ends.

*****

> # 4. Elon Musk’s SpaceX valuation jumps to about $74 billion

> * SpaceX completed another monster equity funding round of $850 million last week, people familiar with the financing told CNBC, sending the company’s valuation skyrocketing 60% from its previous raise in August to about $74 billion. Elon Musk, who also co-founded Tesla, saw insiders and existing investors in his commercial space company selling an additional $750 million in a secondary transaction, one of the people said. SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on this report.

*****

> # 5. Millions in Texas still without power as new storm hits

> * Millions of residents in Texas were still in the dark Wednesday with no indication when their service might return as another winter storm moved across the southern part of the nation. In all, between 2 million and 3 million customers in the energy capital of the U.S. had no power — two days after historic snow and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity for heat.

> * Wholesale power and natural gas prices soared in recent days. However, natural gas futures dropped early Wednesday. U.S. oil prices kept up their advance Wednesday, gaining more than 1% and pushing above $61 per barrel, levels not seen since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

The true “trick” to getting rich quick on the market when you’re just starting out is to find stocks that will double or more (Youtube research will do), find them early and go in substantially and HOLD.

For me it is was Nio, Spce, Nndm and mrna to name a few. I hit 100k profit in 10 months trading.

2/18/21 23:12,"CRSR: PSA for the anguished My dearest precious retards,

Stocks go up and down, sometimes for days and months or even years, without any rhyme or reason, all the while having the underlying improve drastically in value. We saw this in Tesla. What is important is revisiting your thesis every time downturns happen, and asking yourself if there is a need to panic.

When you do that, you should realize (as you probably already have) that the stock is currently falling without any reason. Well a deeper look does give you a few suspects we could line up for further scrutiny:

1.	⁠Corsair completed an acquisition recently;
2.	⁠The general market is on a downturn. This was not necessarily the case immediately after IPO when players had not positioned and it had a negative beta in the weeks following. But now, they have, broader market implications are now more relevant.
3.	⁠The float is 25% of outstanding. As the float is very low, the stock is naturally volatile. Volatility does not mean down always, it means up and down always.
4.	⁠Upcoming lockup expiration which spooks some investors.

I believe all of the above reasons have no material long term downward pressure to the stock.

What matters then, you ask? Corsair is a deep value play, when it started in 1994, they were only suppliers of memory cards to over-clocking enthusiasts. There was no need to overclock yet around the year 2000 because we simply did not have the applications that needed the boost. Now we do. In 2006, Corsair saw that GPUs were increasingly more power hungry and they decided to diversify into PSU. We know now that these early decisions are what made Corsair a giant in these departments.

Corsair is now attempting the same with streaming. The gaming industry is maturing, with technologies requiring typically 30 years to fully mature. Following 2000, we are now in the final decade of its maturation, we are seeing increasing numbers in streaming being consumed as content. Corsair has seen this already, and since 2018, it has been morphing into a one stop solution for streamers, from hardware, to software (hopefully soon).

We must respect the time horizon of the founder, and give him 6 years at the least to realize the fruits of his early investments into streaming, thus 2024.

With this in mind, barring any unknown unknowns, I am confident we will see a glorious two years of growth. We already see that in every metric reported by corsair in its earnings. Rising revenue alongside rising profit margins? I believe its P/S of ~2 and the management decisions made makes the stock a steal and these downturns are a great period to accumulate, just like the whales.

Having conviction makes it all okay. Having a larger time horizon would also ease the burden you currently face.

2/18/21 08:51,"$TSLA- and the only 🌈🐻 case I'd ever make Tl;dr: $TSLA is going to come down, likely by a good bit if steel prices (and commodities in general) stay high.  Just a good time to BTFD.  No one wins betting against Papa Elon.

I likely will look back on this shitpost and regret it in 6 months when $TSLA is at $4,200, but the idea has been in my head for weeks now and hasn't changed.  $TSLA has gone on an incredible tear but I think higher steel prices (and higher prices for all commodities) is what finally brings it back down.  My thinking:

- The momentum play has finally run out.  There just aren't as many people chasing this thing higher as there were last year.  Just look at all the non-GME DD posts here.  Everyone is looking for the next thing to moon.

- Their margins are going to get squeezed for the next two quarters as the majority of their product is made from steel, aluminum and other commodities.  Inflation, beyond current expectations is coming.  Today's PPI came in almost double the current estimates.  The Fed can say they're not going to worry about inflation now, but that will only cause prices to run higher and faster.

- Interest rates are going to start increasing.  This is a big issue because all those deposits that Tesla has only lock in your place in line - not the price of the vehicle or the financing.  If production costs increase they can either eat it in their margins, or try and pass along the costs.  I'm sure many people will still pay the going rate for a Tesla but just the possibility of that happening will hurt the stock.

- Finally, the competition for high end EVs is really ramping up.  I really think Tesla is best in class and will likely stay that way, but people will shift their attention to the newest thing and hype up the ""oh no too much quality competition"" angle.

Now the important part - is there a solid way to play this, looking at the premiums on put options right now? No.  Would I sell covered calls against my shares before the premiums and IV come down?  Yes.  But this is just a Wendy's so thanks for letting me vent at the drive thru.

2/20/21 09:34,"DD from Hollywood Film Producer Part II: AMC, Stimulus, and Post-Covid Landscape Alright guys, just got off a group meeting that included John Fithian, President of the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO, lol). They're lobbying to get more stim $$$ to distressed movie theaters. Lemme summarize what I learned, and also **explain why all this is bullish for AMC.**

**1) What did NATO do?**

\-They successfully lobbied for a $15-billion relief package for indie movie theaters that have suffered a greater than 25% revenue loss. This bill, unfortunately doesn't cover AMC, Regal, and Cinemark.

\-However, NATO lobbied to give tax credits for the aforementioned bigger theaters. This might not sound like a lot, but the tax credit was the only thing that allowed TSLA to have profitable quarters prior to last year. 

\-Also, all theater workers (including at AMC), will have unemployment benefits extended nationwide.

\-As if that's not enough, NATO is continuing to lobby for bigger companies like AMC to receive stimulus money.   


**2) Will Streaming Kill theaters after the re-open?**  
\-This seams to be the #1 concern amongst WSBers and reddit people across different subs. Well, I have a great answer for you: NO.

\-NATO, AMC, Regal, Cinemark  worked out deals with most of the major studios to NOT simultaneously release films online with their theatrical releases post-covid. Theatrical box office windows (and their revenues) will therefore be protected once we officially re-open America.  


**3) Consolidation:**

\-Several thousand least-performing theaters have already shut down. This, for better and worse, will help AMC. NATO actually finds this to be a good by-product of covid, as underperforming theaters have been wasteful for movies that screened in them. It's very likely that AMC and or Regal will buy them out and renovate those theaters.   


4**) Pent-up Demand:**

\-Japan and China have reopened their theaters. Both have had RECORD box office numbers with domestic movies that typically don't beat tentpoles like The Avengers or Batman, etc.   


**5) Unprecedented Pipeline:**

It's ultimately all about the movies. Will the be good, and will you see them?  
I'm pleased to say, 2021 and 2022 will be INSANE. 

Normally, you might have one or two big event movies a year. After March, we have like 1 or 2 tentpole releases every month this year, including but not limited to:  
Godzilla Vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Cruella, F9, Uncharted (the movie), Venom sequel, Spider-man sequel, Conjuring sequel, Top Gun sequel, Space Jam (with LBJ), James Bond, Resident Evil and many auteur driven lower budget films by PT Anderson, David Fincher, and Wes Anderson.   


**6) Theaters found more ways to make money:**

\-Also, the closure of the theaters was an opportunity for the bigger theater chains to improve and re-model their outdated systems. 

\-Many rear-projection screens (that require projectionists and expensive projectors) are being replaced by LED screens. 

\-Sound systems are being dramatically improved. 

\-The seats will have tables, suitable for the service of Wine, Beer, and Meals.  


**7) The Craziest (and likely) Scenario:**

\-The Paramount Consent Decrees are being repealed. This decree basically prevented one company from producing and exhibiting films. 

\-NATO is now in talks with Apple, Amazon, and Netflix to screen content in movie theaters.   
Netflix has already bought a number of independent theaters. 

\-There are rumors about AAPL or AMZN acquiring AMC!  John didn't deny those rumors.  


**TL;DR** \- Stimulus has lagged in helping the movie theaters because they were deemed ""non-essential,"" but not anymore. Money's on the way. Also, after we re-open, we'll have one of the most ridiculously popular films released all at once for the next two years, in protected viewing windows in which theaters will not compete with streamers like Netflix and Amazon. On the contrary, Amazon or Apple might acquire theater companies, like AMC and Regal due to the repeal of the Paramount Consent Decrees.

2/20/21 04:51,"Why MRO is Extremely Undervalued Why MRO is extremely undervalued:

First, MRO's market cap is $6.02 billion, but its net assets are $10.89 billion. This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. 

For one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020.

Once they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. 

People will say that oil isn't as hot as renewables, which is true, but oil isn't gonna go away either. Between now and 2030, people still need oil to drive cars. Remember that gas powered cars are still 97.5% of all cars on the road right now. 

Furthermore, IF Tesla somehow pops, many electric car companies may pop as well and they might switch to gas car or oil companies. This can act as a hedge in the event Tesla pops.

2/22/21 23:33,"Seriously Evaluating Systemic Risk **Background**

Put to call ratio is hovering near decade lows, GDP/Market cap is at a record low, the Shiller PE Ratio is at a decade high (but still lower than the peak of the dotcom bubble) - but these traditional measures seem to have failed us. Analysts use these ratios to assess current valuation against historical periods to determine whether stocks are overvalued and due for a correction. However, stocks like Tesla now are ""valued"" based on abstract future possibilities and valuation multiples across the stock market were historically inflated *last year*. 

This is because of liquidity conditions. Stock market gains are closely correlated to increases in M1. The fed pushing down yields has increased the incentive for investors to enter into other asset classes, which caused equities to rise amidst unemployment numbers overshooting projections, earnings collapsing, and national unrest. The Fed acting as a universal buyer of debt allowed firms to issue debt at low rates, allowing them to survive the period depressed spending. This also happened in 09, when GDP fell yet the stock market recovered because of QE.

Instead, what we require to evaluate to the market as a whole is a relational, macroeconomic perspective that tells us where investors have an incentive to put their funds based on future economic scenarios, because the market is forward looking. What this means is looking at bond yields, DXY, GDP and levels of debt, etc. to gage the current state of the economy.

I'm assuming you've all seen the Burry tweet posted here, where he warns people of what he thinks is coming, which is inflation, followed by a stock market crash. The top comment on that thread says the tweet has ""nothing to do"" with the stock market, but DXY. While it's true that inflation has a more direct impact on DXY, a collapsing dollar has *obvious* implications for stocks, which I'll talk about next. 

There are many possible scenarios for a market crash at some point in the future, what I'm going to do here is lay out some of the scenarios, what we should be looking at, how likely it is, and how to time it.

**What does Inflation means for the Economy?**

With the fed continuing with it's QE program, rising treasury yields indicates two possible things, continuing expectations of economic recovery, and inflation. Investors buy 10 yr treasury for stable returns when they expect periods of high volatility, so will sell the bonds when they expect conditions to normalize. Inflation expectations decrease real returns on existing bonds, so investors have an incentive to sell bonds and buy equities or newly issued bonds, also causing yields to increase.

Clearly, people expect  a full economic recovery, this has been obvious since the vaccine came out, and the stock market reflects that. At the same time, commodity prices have increased, indicating inflation - but not at a level that worries the Fed, which has maintained that it will continue to maintain a loose monetary policy. So clearly, the rising yields is caused by a combination of the two.

None of this *necessarily* impact stocks negatively. What really matters is how severe the inflation is likely to be. If inflation slowly creeps up to 2% by the end of the year, stocks may not react badly. Even though yields would increase, this alone doesn't increase the relative attractiveness of debt to equity because it is only nominal yields that are going up. Rather, existing debt depreciates in value, which only hurts current bond holders. 

However, if inflation is worse than expected, that is, it shoots up to 2% faster than expected, the market may end up pricing in a potential rate hike. Historically, this could mean a *major* stock market crash. Given that Burry is predicting Weimar style hyperinflation, it's pretty fucking obvious that he's bearish on stocks in addition to DXY. He has literally said the market is [""dancing on a knifes edge.""](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1363383141168128004?s=20)

Why would this cause a stock market crash? The US economy is burdened with a huge amount of debt, investors are piling into corporate debt, margin debt is at a historical high, mortgages are booming, etc. This significantly increase the depth of a potential crash due to forced liquidations. The levels of systemic risk in the economy is huge.

**Will Inflation Occur?**

This is a harder question to answer. We know what to look for when considering how likely it is that the Fed will be forced to intervene: yields, commodity prices, DXY, and the sharpness of moves in all three. There's probably other perspectives to take that I'm missing. But at this point can we answer whether inflation will overshoot the Fed expectations?

The Fed has been showing that economic activity remains depressed because the velocity of money has cratered. In one scenario, as reopening accelerates, people get vaccinated, and global travels picks up, we will see the velocity of money shoot up. Combined with historically unprecedented levels of M1, this could lead to extremely high levels of inflation. That said, given that the USD is the global reserve currency and is used to trade oil, the sheer demand for the dollar keeps it from crashing, so Burry's comparison of America to the Weimar Republic seems like an exaggeration, but he's probably run the numbers, whereas I haven't. 

In another extreme scenario, economic growth remains anemic, and monetary stimulus fails, leading to Japanification, which the EU is edging closer and closer to. This means, equities may continue to trade at current multiples, because yields remain extremely low. However, the recent rally in bond yields suggest that this narrative may not play out in America and we won't have to see things like negative rates.

Between these two scenarios, there are many possibilities. America's low inflation in the last 10 years, despite loose monetary policy, points to secular stagnation that hasn't progressed to the levels we see in Europe and Japan. The US economy is still relatively dynamic, and we might just see a fairly normal economic recovery.

That said, given the levels of M1, I would argue that we are currently in uncharted waters. I am personally neutral between the various scenarios and will update my perspective based on the key indicators I've mentioned. This warrants more research, looking at how currency in *active circulation* (not exactly M1), which would increase as velocity goes up, would impact exchange rates at current levels of demand.

**Timing**

The hardest question to answer. Since this is /r/wallstreetbets, what people here really care about is timing, especially given the penchant for options. I've read ""bearish"" cases that extend this rally all the way out to 2025 before a ""great reset,"" whereas Burry implies that this will all play out in 2021. 

As far as timing goes, the best we can do is continue to monitor the key indicators that may indicate an impending crash because the stock market may react to ""too much"" inflation before it actually happens - if DXY crashes, if yields accelerate upward, if consumers start to notice increasing commodity prices. On the other hand, none of this might happen, my goal here is to have a discussion.

In the short run, we have more stimulus hanging over us. At this point, we're all conditioned not to short when there's stimulus on the horizon and I think that continues to hold. As long as the money printer is going, your best bet is to stay long. What Burry is clearly predicting, is a scenario that forces the Fed to turn off the money printer, which will mean a paradigm shift for this sub (see header).",34434,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.995618761,True

2/22/21 10:17,"XPENG lockup plus earnings play. Another short term PLTR-esque play? Hey everyone first DD here but the PLTR lockup play a lot of us did plus earnings season inspired me to look at different stocks in the same context and I really think XPEV could be a multibagger in the next two weeks.

1. Lockup expiry is Tuesday premarket with earnings report on March 8. Current price of 41.14, trending downward steadily since Jan 22, when it was 56.39

2. Overall I am bullish: Has started to send small amounts of vehicles (200+ recently) to Norway, whereas NIO and Li auto have not yet expanded into Europe. Also Xpeng will soon have two factories online in China, whereas NIO has none. They have also stolen source code for autonomous driving from Tesla a while back (lol).

4. Delivery of 6,015 vehicles in January, so I expect guidance to be good.

Remember last week with PLTR? I don’t think there actually has been any huge reasons why XPENG would fall so hard in the last month except for maybe investors starting to pivot away from EVs and the upcoming lockup. However, with the lockup expiring on Tuesday, we might see some selling pressure leading up to expiry and then see more investors jumping in, especially towards runup. XPENG has a lot less hype than NIO and Tesla, but I really think there is a case to be made that big money is just waiting on the sidelines here, given their increasing manufacturing capabilities, growth in delivery numbers, and their positively developing software. Plus, their earnings this time are AFTER lockup. Isn’t that great?

I have no positions now, but on Tuesday near EOD I am planning on buying some slightly OTM calls for March 12 (whatever $2k can buy), then selling before earnings. Does anybody think this is a bad play?

update: Since EV all got murdered today I am considering a mix of long dated calls and at the march 5 expiry date to lower risk

2/22/21 01:58,"What if I told you, you could buy a Rolls Royce for £1 gbp? Thats right, a whole share of RR for £1. 

But RR is boomer stock, it makes luxury cars and not even electric ones. It's not a tech company and it's on the LSE. It even pays dividends! 

Just like BB and NOK, that's exactly what they want you to think. While we are chasing TSLA, APL and other big tech. The smart money is holding RR, BB and NOK. 

RR isn't a car company. BMW bought the RR brand. RR instead are a heavy industries and tech company. Their main business is Jet engines, with side ventures in Nuclear power plants, rocket engines and ship engines. 

Jet engines: unless you've been under a rock these last few hours you will know that a jet engine blew up recently. That engine was attached to a Boeing 777 and was a Pratt and Whitney engine. NOT A RR ENGINE. 

The scare from this event might ground all P&W engines, it might not. But what it will do is give manufacturers (airbus and Boeing) a clear reason to choose RR over their main competition. Airbus already use RR engines, Boeing uses it on some of their back room stock. If they do get grounded, RR will go to the moon (we'll come back to that) if they don't,  then it still bullish.  

Nuclear power: RR have developed small scale nuclear power plants.  With Texas losing power, small nuclear back up power plants might be seen as an alternate way to ensure 24/7 power to a local area. Oil, gas are on the way out and while sustainable power is good, nuclear will play a big role in meeting the needs of the future. 

Ship engines: RR make the engines for the Royal Navy (the fourth largest Navy in the world) including the engines for HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. 

That means RR is a crucial part of the UKs defence system and as such will not be allowed to fail. Thats right, it doesn't matter how bad RR finances get, the UK government will bail them out. Because they aren't going to allow their new multi billion dollar aircraft carriers to go out of service due to mechanical failure. 

Not only that but Boris Johnson is investing into the Royal Navy like no conservative Prime Minster before. There are 8 new Royal Navy Frigates currently being built with the Australian Navy in line to order 1 for themselves. While BAE is leading the project, RR are heavily involved in propulsion and steering. Again, their involvement in ongoing defence contracts means the chances of bankruptcy is 0. 

Space: Here is how we get to the moon. The UK space agency has signed a contract with Rolls Royce to look into nuclear powered space flight [link](http://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/12-01-2021-rr-uk-space-agency-launches-first-study-into-nuclear-power.aspx)

2/22/21 00:46,"Has AI well predicted the movement of Tesla's stock price? In the case of Qraft's fully AI-driven momentum ETF, $AMOM, it often shows that Tesla stocks are heavily weighted and then sold entirely next month. During the rebalancing at the end of January, $AMOM sold all of its $TSLA holdings of 6.7% (third in the portfolio ranking) during the rebalancing process.

$AMOM ETF has recorded a cumulative return of 79.33% (TR) and outperformed the benchmark by 36.28%p (TR) since listing on NYSE in May 2019 and is showing the best performance among the US large-cap momentum ETF category. So, you may expect that the market timing of $AMOM is also relatively accurate. We analyzed in detail whether $AMOM is really good at Tesla stocks' market timing.

**Fact 1)**

After $AMOM bought the first Tesla stock at the end of April 2020, there have been only 3 cases that the weight of Tesla stock in the portfolio is zero. During the 1 month after rebalancing to 0, the actual Tesla's monthly returns were -14.56% (2020-9), -11.96% (2020-10), and -3.3% (As of 2021-02-19, not finished yet). In fact, these three months are the only months that Tesla stock has recorded a negative return since May 2020.

**Fact 2)**

When $AMOM buys Tesla stock once, it gradually increases its weight and then sells all at once. Until now, Tesla’s stock price has been showing negative returns without exception during the period from the selling of the entire volume to the re-buying of Tesla, which can be seen as a good market timing of AI.

**Fact 3)**

There is a significant linear relationship between the weight of Tesla stock predicted by $AMOM at the end of each month and the actual monthly return of Tesla stock for the following month. Although there are few samples, the correlation coefficient of 0.84 / R\^2 value is shown to be about 0.7. This means that the weight of Tesla in $AMOM, which changes at the end of each month, predicts Tesla stock's next month's return. (In other words, the higher the weight of Tesla in $AMOM during rebalancing at the end of each month, the higher the next month's Tesla yield.) If the weight of Tesla in $AMOM is calculated to 0, the actual value is negative (short) weight in the AI engine, so reflecting this, the correlation coefficient and R\^2 value become larger.

**Fact 4)**

This is the result of combining luck and actual predictive power, and this predictive power may change in the future.

2/25/21 08:44,"Solid State Battery-tech/stock Ok Guys, Listen Up. As You might know this is the last era of the lithium-battery. You know, that chargebale battery and the one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every 2 hours and your Tesla (who doesn’t have one these days?) after 400-500 km. Let’s not forget a battery’s purpose is to stores energy. The more energy you can store in a smaller battery, the happier we humans are. Energy=happiness.

Finding a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in Greek mythology. According to the legend, anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler. According to the present technology, anyone who could develop a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery would rule the EV world.

A few listed companies are working on revolutionary Solid-State Batterys. Instead of LI-ion, Solid-State Batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes. For the ones who never heard about these, use Opera or Google to DYOR.

Solid-State Batteries promise, already today:

\- Twice the energy  
\- 1/100th of the size  
\- 6x faster charsing  
\- 10X longer lifetime  
\- Non-flammability

This new piece of 21th-century-technology will definitely evolve coming years. Elon Musk already called it the MOAB.

Now let’s talk stocks. A few companies are working on a Solid-State Battery, expecting to bring it to the market within a few years. Today, much of the development work on solid-state batteries is performed with partnerships. Among the players are conventional Li-ion battery-cell manufacturers (i.e., Samsung SDI, LG Chem, A123 Systems), battery separator technology solutions suppliers (Asahi Kasei), and materials suppliers (Solvay, Umicore, etc.).

QuantumScape  
Panasonic  
Samsung  
LG  
Ionic Materials  
BMW Solid  
Power  
Toyota  
Ilika

According to Yole Développement’s market forecast, mass production of solid-state batteries will begin by 2022 and represent less than 1% of Li-ion battery demand by 2025. This might explain the relative low interest from investors today, which might change when large solid-state battery manufacturing capacities start to be built.

Samsung, LG, BMW etc are all searching for the Solid-State battery for own use, so that is not interesting for me to invest in; they already reached their market share. Today there are 2 stocks I want to discuss with you: Quantumscape and Ilika.

You might have heard about QuantumScape before. QS went to the moon ($10- $130) when Volkswagen announced it took an extra 20% stake in the battery manufacturing company (crazy times on the stock market back in the days). Now QS is stable between $40 - $50. Fair price for a company with no revenue, but a huge potential in the EV market. QS is already backed by $300 million worth of investment from Volkswagen, Bill Gates and hedge fund billionaire George Soros. Ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries, trading around $3-$4. Ilika has has two development programs:

\- Stereax: miniature batterys for MedTech

\- Goliath: solid-states for the EV and other battery-powered transportation The scope of growth is huge in both industries. Compared to QS and to see what’s happening with their stocks, lets only focus on the EV market. Ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the Solid-State Battery in 2026, that’s the same period as the planning of QS. Ilika actually plans a pre-pilot this year and a construction pilot in 2024. For more information, DYOR.

So why is ILIKF trading $2-$4 and QS $40-$50?

Founded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago, with financial backing from Volkswagen AG, QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). When the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a $3.3 billion valuation was appropriate. Following a blistering stock-market run, QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value. Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1,060% return. QuantumScape’s prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft Inc. cofounder Bill Gates, hedge fund billionaire George Soros’s Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham. JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla, is on the board. These people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon $$$.

Looking at their financials and progress, QS and Ilika do not differ that much. They both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next 5-7 years, and both planning to bring their product to market in 2025. To understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production.

The difference is QS plans to build a giga-factory to manufacture their batteries, which asks for a huge investment (0,5 billion – 750 million per GWh). That is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital. Ilika has chosen a different route. They will use the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC) as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the GWh. UKBIC is a key part of the Faraday Battery Challenge (FBC), a Government programme to fast track the development of cost-effective, high-performance, durable, safe, low-weight and recyclable batteries. Therefor Ilika doesn’t need the same capital investment to fund their growth.

So here is the point. Solid-State Battery technology is the future of battery. Ilika is growing in multiple industries including the EV market. Therefor I believe Ilike is a save and good investment for the long term. What are your thoughts on this? Is Ilika a good investment?",34867,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.99605298,True

EDIT: I forgot you guys can't read - TL;DR: short term 🚀🚀, long term = big ⬇️. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all. 

Before I start let me make it clear that, while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I've seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards

Also - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren't insanely overvalued. I'm betting against the stock, not the company. Let's just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let's talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla's fate towards reality.

First - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren't they spending this cash on future R&D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/'the culture' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I'm sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn't unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they're so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don't have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they'd rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it's definitely non-standard and doesn't speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don't have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven't already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don't have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren't aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They're behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn't get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it's hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it's also less risk, and they're not THAT slow seeing as they're already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.

Second - let's talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I'm not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don't know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I'll talk about that in a second. 
Cars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they're sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won't deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don't know ""What's an electricity"" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn't lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn't reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I'm not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won't lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they'd need to be pumping out multiple different models. I'm talking a non ""cyber"" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an 'adventure sport' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that's coming out. Americans like big cars, it's a fact. Just because it's an EV and saving the planet doesn't mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn't fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don't continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they're going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven't even hinted at it so far. I don't know specific numbers, and I don't think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn't going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they're backing themselves into a corner and a specific 'look' that might be hard to shake later.
Next: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they're not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There's also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it's still a matter of scale. I don't know their production numbers but with how little I've heard about it, I don't think they're huge, and if demand spikes, they won't be in a great place to capture it if they aren't scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above). 
Now let's talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that's not big money. Maybe I'm not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don't think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they're so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can't really take payments for it, unless it's well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that's the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it's even easier money than now if they're less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla's ""insurance"" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn't too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they're taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I'm just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don't trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don't generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won't be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won't be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they're going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn't respond, or what if they aren't a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they're drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won't clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won't charge themselves after they're done with their 'shift', so unless you're able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it's impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here's the kicker - it's not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they're the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it's not *as* popular from what I've seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren't really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it's still not as easy as saying 'but it's the fUtuRe'.
Semis - I don't know shit about shit here, but I haven't heard much more than a peep about this, so I'm naively assuming it's not a huge corner of Tesla's business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don't see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I'm very wrong.
Lastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla's batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don't really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don't want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don't figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla's battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla's, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn't that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn't mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won't go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn't mean these other companies won't hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They're assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they're the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn't make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn't mean everyone will use Tesla's stuff. Some people don't like the brand, some people don't like Elon, others may just like other stuff more. 

Finally, look at the ""anatomy of a bubble"" and compare it to Tesla's stock chart. It's shockingly similar. I know, I know, that's moronic, but I'm a moron and a 🌈🐻 so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn't the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they're invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood ähem ähem), but every. single. time. they've been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain't there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about 'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you'll make money'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don't just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.

There's a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish. 
For some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, ""loos-id"" (don't think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain. 
However - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they're just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don't offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn't a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I'm not saying they're gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don't treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don't change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.

So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla's stock price, but here's where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla's book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla's assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&D and drop their book value by doing so, but here's the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven't. I don't see them taking out massive loans that haven't been 'normal business procedure' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let's look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don't think it's really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific 'stock issue' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla's is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they're 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we're assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today. 

In my opinion, Tesla's true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This 'book value' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created 'Lean Manufacturing' (it's called ""the Toyota way"") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you're truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history. 

So where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don't think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any 'top' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn't throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a 🌈🐻 I'd probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the 'blowoff' phase. We're on the way down now, it's just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our 'local bottom' until we ramp back up to the 'back to normal' section. If you're long Tesla, personally, I'd sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I'm not an expert but I'm guessing in about a week or two we're back up near $800-820 and that'll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I'm as close to certain as I've ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I'm right, I'm buying a Tesla.

Positions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn't sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday

So I started hording some stocks and found once you get 100 you can now sell covered calls.  This is basically finding someone else who wants the option to buy your stocks at a set price and will pay you a little bit for that privelege. 

This is where I don't understand how it's not a great deal.

Let's say AMC you have 200 shares.  Doable with a $1500 investment.   You can sell a call for $9 and $12 ending this Friday and make $32 & $11.  So in one week you made $43.  That's almost a 3% gain in a week.  You can do this every week.  $43 * 52 = 2,236.  With a $15k investment you can make $1600/month before taxes in passive income... 

The downside is 🚀 and AMC jumps to $20 or more in any given week. You lose out on a potential $4000 worth of stock and the sweet karma, but both options would exercise and you would get 100*9 +100*12 = $2100 + $43 premium.

2/25/21 03:52,"Daily DD #1 GM is stupidly undervalued Welcome to Daily DD! I'll be offering one piece of DD on a stock every day for the next few days. On today's episode, GM.

tl;dr at the bottom

Why it'll  🚀this year and next year:

1) Biden wants to make the entire US fleet EV by the end of his term. You really think he's going to buy $70,000 cybertrucks for the fleet? Can you imagine the outrage if federal cars are using fancy Teslas while the average American has to buy regular cars? I think Biden will be more likely to buy GM's newer electric cars once they come out because they'll be much cheaper. Biden also drives GMs cars adding to possible bias or favoritism there. I don't think it's a coincidence that GM announced going fully electric while Biden pushed for a fully electric federal fleet. Either Biden knew GM was going electric or GM knew Biden would make this big purchase order.

2) Cap and trade? Have you heard of it? No? You should learn about it or else you'll lose out on tendies.  Cap and trade is complicated so I'm not gonna explain it here. Go google it. Point is, companies who produce electric cars can receive a rebate because the car emits less CO2 compared to a gas car. In fact, Tesla would've **lost money** in 2020 if it wasn't for California's cap and trade program ([https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html)). Now that GM has access to this cap and trade market, they'll be able to sell these to the remaining gas car companies. This will also hurt Tesla because the more companies sell credits the cheaper they become. 

Also, you know who's likely to pass cap and trade? The federal government. Obama tried to pass cap and trade in 2009 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Clean\_Energy\_and\_Security\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act)), but it was never brought to the senate. With climate change being a more pressing issue, and Biden's talk about solving climate change and green energy jobs, he's for sure going to try to expand and pass cap and trade on the national level. He's also publicly supported cap and trade ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/)). From his campaign website ""And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal, including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line."" This seems to refer to cap and trade as it's the only real enforcement mechanism to achieve a targeted climate change goal. With democrats controlling everything, cap and trade is likely to pass this time. 

Then again, politicians lie all the time and  Biden isn't much different. However, even if the feds don't step in, multiple states have already passed cap and trade with many more to come. 

3) GMs cars are comparable to Tesla's cars.  The Model 3 isn't actually that good. The Chevy Bolt has a range of 259 miles, about 22 miles longer than Tesla. Both cars cost about the same amount. The newer Chevy Bolts also have fast charging, so Tesla's starting to lose its moat here. Guess Elon's plan to not patent anything really screwed him over.

4) The PE on this is stupidly low. Come on? 12.13? It's practically **begging** to be bought at this price. Compare this to Tesla's 1,230. If GM and Tesla, both EV companies, had the same valuation, GM would be worth $5000. This is my price target lmao.

5) The UK, Norway, and other countries are planning to ban vehicles. Norway is the most aggressive at 2025. China is also considering it, which would make EV companies like GM go absolutely parabolic. GM has the Chevy Bolt, meaning they already have a head start in terms of experience when it comes to producing EVs.

Why is the stock down?

There are a lot of things that make people scared of GM. Here's why I think they're dumb:

1) The chip shortage:

This is a concern for GM in the short run, but they were still able to beat earnings compared to 2019. Currently they're projecting the earnings will be $1-$2 billion lower next year due to the shortage. I think that's a worst case scenario and the market is **overreacting** to the chip shortage. The chip shortage is now getting the concern of Congress and Biden ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/)). Given that Biden always talks about manufacturing, funding the semiconductor shortage via loans or grants and boosting domestic production of semiconductors could serve an easy win. He can claim this is coronavirus stimulus money to build manufacturing jobs or whatever. GM gets its chips from Qualcomm, which has a ton of facilities in the US and is based in San Diego. This can serve as an easy political win for Biden. 

2) Charging stations. This isn't going to be a concern for much longer. Most people don't drive for long haul journeys, so driving stations aren't really needed. Think about it. If you could fill up your car with gas at home, would you ever go to a gas station? Very rarely. This is the point of EVs, and it's why I think they'll be the future. Also I hate to mention Biden again, but he's planning to put 500,000 public charging stations in the US by 2030. This won't be a problem much longer. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars))

3) bEaR mArKEt. Chill. This shit happens every couple of months. People panic and say the market is crashing. It's not. Even if it was, GM would hardly be hit because its PE is so stupidly low. IMO the only company that should tank a ton is Tesla. People always bring up the **bUfFeT inDicAtoR** because they think Buffet is some kind of god. He's not. Sometimes Buffet is an idiot. He doesn't understand the tech industry, and I think the rise in stocks recently is tech related. We're entering a new era of American capitalism where tech companies dominate. 7% stock market growth is the norm. With GDP rising 2% per year, you should expect to see a high divergence in the long run. The buffet indicator only measures GDP too, which isn't remotely the same as stock prices. Stocks get their values from earnings and also the assets the company owns. GDP doesn't factor wealth into consideration at all. 

One last point: people think it's a buy and hold for 10 years, but it's not. I think GM will go to the moon ($5000) quicker than you think. Stocks move faster than reality and price in future expectations. There are a lot of catalysts incoming (charging stations, no new gas cars, chip production, and cap and trade). If any one of these things are announced, that's GM to $100. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr Buy GM. Cap and trade, EV ban, and its undervalued price make it super attractive. GM will hit $5000. Buy or cry.

2/25/21 03:28,"DD: Ford is STILL undervalued as fuck but the catalyst could be coming soon 🚀🚀 rocket emoji stonks $F This is not advice I have no idea what I'm talking about I went to a D-tier state school and got a C in accounting II. Please do your own research and don't come knocking at my door when you don't make gamestop money on Ford. Also this is my first DD after lurking for years so please be as mean as possible. Edited for formatting.


So we all know that EVs are the future and that someday we are all going to be driven around in Teslas, so you could dismiss the legacy automakers as boomer shit stuck in the past, but I think that the market has over-corrected for this and overlooked a couple things:

* Ford has been stealthily morphing into a tech-centric automaker
* Ford's fundamentals are still really solid
* Ford's new management team gets it

I'll go into detail into each below. Here are some ford financials from Yahoo finance to set up some context: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/key-statistics?p=F 

* Forward P/E: 10.53
* P/S: 0.36
* Mkt Cap: $46B


**Factor 1: Ford understands where the auto market is going.**
A couple years ago, when Ford announced that they were going to stop producing sedans for the US market, I thought they were smoking crack. Sedans still represent a thicc market segment. But nah, they kept around the high margin trucks and suvs and let GM, Honda, Toyota have the dwindling US sedan market so that they could focus their resources on developing next-gen products. And some of those are finally here and they are legit actually pretty good. 

The Mach-E: $42k, 300mi range, 3.5 second 0-60. Fast charging. Not quite Tesla good yet but damn close. This is a legit viable product, and you don't get any of the Tesla customer service issues. If you factor in the $7500 federal tax credit, it's cheaper than a Model Y. 

Electric F150 coming soon: best selling truck in America getting an EV version. It's going to be good too. The legit info on this car is coming later this year most likely and it's going to be solid. They've already demoed it pulling a million pounds (which is BS because it was on rails so doesn't count - so we don't get a real tow cap number yet but we know it's yoked). And it's going to look like a real truck so they can capture the whole toxic-masculinity-but-my-wife-cares-about-climate-change market.

They own part of Rivian. Rivian gonna be dope af and if they can leverage Ford's manufacturing experience they could potentially skip a large part of the painful production ramp-up that Tesla went through. And Ford gets paid in the process and gets access to the tech Rivian develops. 

Tesla's PE is like fucking 200. That's how wall street values tech companies and innovation companies. Share price is gonna go ape once the analysts figure out that Ford is a tech company that is merely funded by a legacy automaker dinosaur.

**Factor 2: Ford's leadership gets it**
Meet Jim Farley. He's like Jim Hackett, but palatable to the shareholders. What does he care about? Yeah, autonomous tech and EVs. Would you prefer he be focusing Ford's attention elsewhere? Didn't think so. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/new-ford-ceo-jim-farley-announces-restructuring-and-executive-shakeup.html 

**Bear Case: Ford's Fundamentals Alone Under-Price it: They Make Cars People Actually Want**
Lord Elon told God-Conduit Cathie Wood on her podcast (it's on Youtube but I can't link it - search for Elon Cathie Wood Podcast and it's at 3:30) that EVs sales will comprise 1/3 of global auto sales by 2023-2025. That's crazy growth given that EVs were about 2% of US sales last year (I know, not fair to compare US to world but it's not the main point, just context). 

If that growth rate holds we're looking at like 8-10 more years of ICE vehicle sales. Which ICE vehicles do Americans like? That's right, fucking TRUCKS and SUVs, the exact vehicles that are Ford's bread and butter. The F-150 is the best selling vehicle in America and has been for years. 

This vehicle segment is super margin - the average sale price of an F150 is over $40k according to CarGurus (https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/price-trends/Ford-F-150-d337). People pay stupid money for these things and Ford will be happy to accommodate them.

So, let's assume that my thesis above is incorrect, and Ford has no future in the EV space and will do nothing milk the dying ICE Truck-Yeah market until the day they hit insolvency. How could we value them then?  

Fortunately, such a car maker actually exists and it's called fucking Fiat-Chrysler. They Yolo'd everything into the Murica-Fuck-Yeah market segment and will literally sell you a Hellcat powered anything - only car they make that doesn't have a V8 option is the fucking Pacifica - a minivan. These guys are lunatics and pre-Peurgot merger had absolutely no plan for adapting to the future of the auto market except for buying gas mileage credits from Tesla. Let's compare their stats to Ford from above: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCAU.VI/key-statistics?p=FCAU.VI
 
* Forward P/E: 5.78
* P/S:  0.24
* Mkt cap: $42B

So the market is literally pricing Ford right now quite similarly to Fiat-Chrylser. Ask yourself who's future strategy makes more sense. If Ford fucked up literally everything going forward, I think their valuation makes sense. But if they have just a few product successes in the new automotive landscape, they are going to stick around... and there's your catalyst.

TLDR; ford doesn't make cars, they make rockets that go to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",35079,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.972474992,True

As many of you know, the world of cryptocurrency has become somewhat of a leading indicator in the equity markets. With Elon's purchase of digital currency as well as other fintechs such as SQ and PYPL that are deep holdings of ARKK, the share price of ARKK (which controls a lot of stakes in various companies) is inevitably now tied to digital coin prices. Thus, if coin prices were to fall through, it would create more downside pressure on TSLA and ARKK. Then, investors would start cashing out of ARKK, lowering ARKK's AUM and that will create a loop where ARKK has to sell shares across the board, which will create more downside pressure and it will create more drawdowns for the entire market. 

Thus, wall street has to support coin prices in order to make sure that TSLA and ARKK dont fall. Otherwise, the fact that this cryptocurrency is now an internal cog of fintech and TSLA as well as the fact that ARKK is now involved in so many different companies across the board will literally spell drawdowns for the entire market because of the fall of digital currency prices. In other words, the coin has now truly become the LEADING indicator of equity markets (especially in tech). As hedgefunds are leveraged in their tech positions, massive drawdowns in technology companies will force margin calls that will permeate to other assets such as value and commodities. This will in effect bring liquidations of other asset classes (similar to March 2020 liquidations in some ways). 

Unlike 2017 where digital coin was secluded from equity markets, 2021 is a different story where coins have become an internal cog of the markets because so many companies that are part of these ETFs have holdings in it.

2/24/21 02:04,"Case for TSLA 2030 Case for tesla long term:

Its a lot of speculation.  But we have an idea what tesla is targeting.  And we have teslas track record for the past 10 years or so.

20M deliveries by 2030.  Power revenues equal to auto revenues.  Plus robo taxis.  Not to mention anything else like service, superchargers, insurance, possible air craft down the road, etc.

So you can use that, 30% margins on autos, avg selling prices of say $25k. To get auto revenues estimates.  Double that revenue for power.  Then multiple by a probability of success.

Robo taxis are a real outlier that could possibly double both of those or be equal to zero.

So its really difficult to assign value. Which is why the stock is so volatile.

The high price is due to tesla historically high success at hitting 50% CARG since 2012.  Just try carrying forward 30% CARG for 10 years and see what estimates that gives you.

As such market is expecting tesla to do well.  Production is lined up for 1M autos this year to not be an unreasonable number, double of 2020.

Do all the above and assign a price multiple to the revenue.

So teslas track is strong, its history is strong, and its potential is even stronger.


So do the math.  20M autos at 25k sale price yields 500B in revenue.  Double that to include power potential, so $1T in revenue.  30% margins leaves us with 300B in profits (assuming they can get earnings to near equal auto margins, they currently do NOT).  A 20 P/E gives us $6T market cap.  This ignores robo taxis.

So $6000 a share by 2030, assuming no robo taxi revenue, production hit targets, and 20 P/E.  Obviously a lot of risk to these targets though.

Alternatively, 40% CARG (tesla has had 50% since they IPO'd) would put 2030 revenue at $896B.  Not far off from the above.


Big questions are

1) can it hit/maintain 30% margins as EVs race to the bottom on prices/commodize.  Apple has done well with phones but autos may be more difficult, idk

2) can it turn revenue into profits equal to 30% profit margins.  Current earnings are no where near the declared auto profit margins. 

3) can it scale manufacturing fast enough to hit target with batteries being a big limitation, driven by limits in battery supply chains, which they have to take in house and reinvent to achieve 

4) is a 20 P/E reasonable.  If not what is?  Most autos are much less then this.  But most autos have terrible debt positions and near no growth.  

5) biggest what if, can they make robo taxis a global thing?  How will that affect revenue and margins?

May be a good time to BUY THE DIP

2/23/21 16:53,"The Real Big Short: Passive Investing, Positive Feedback Loops, and The Massive Ark Bubble tl;dr: Long Dated ARKK puts and/or debit spreads.

""Shut up gay bear!"" ""Don't short meme stocks!"" ""Cathy will bury you!"" Over the last year, you'd probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it's just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don't short SPY, short ARKK.

This is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it's up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it's performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what's happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since ""diversified"" by buying speculative ""growth stocks"" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.

&#x200B;

So what? Well a number of Ark's holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla's meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. 

&#x200B;

Ironically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark's tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy ""growth"" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK's price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK's price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark's illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.

&#x200B;

Maybe it's because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target. This is a David and Goliath moment for our gay bears out there, good luck.",35371,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.649858713,True
2/23/21 14:08,"I think PLTR is invincible rn and in the long run. So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we’ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.

A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don’t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.

Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us 🦍 have to be wary of.

As much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market’s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We’ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.

And well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.

So here’s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn’t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.

But that’s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.

Now, the thesis is that growth firms’ future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here’s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.

Let’s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).

Essentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.

But think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.

They faced the same problems. I’m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn’t have the cash to survive in the EV market.

I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. 
He shore could.

Yes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn’t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain’t cheap. 

(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).

And if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. 

Is it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.

But no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes 🤮🤡.

Fuck the shills who say Palantir can’t continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).

On top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov’t clients at roughly 52%, but let’s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don’t want to get too political here, but broadly, you’re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).

Not too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there’s honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.

And let’s take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.

Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA’s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.

Furthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.

The answer is yes. But Wall St doesn’t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren’t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don’t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‘98 Honda Accord (and that’s exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)

But we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir’s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.

I believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.

And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.

As a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).

For disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.

I'm now convinced that for some stupid reason IG prices option strikes in cents for equities (I have traded VIX options with them before and they're priced in dollars). So I'm 99% sure I just YOLO'd into $6 puts. I can't sell them cause they're worth exactly 0. I can't believe I've been so stupid. Guess I 💎✋with my only hope being Tesla going bankrupt (I think they're overvalued but never going bankrupt). Wish me luck I guess. Fuck me

TLDR: spent all my savings on Tesla $6p Jan 22 thinking they were $600p Jan 22

Proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/ZTDWmVp

Edit 1: I'm currently on the phone to IG and the guy is insisting that they are for $600 and IG don't have any for $6. I'm trying to explain that it's impossible for them to be for $600 pls help.

Edit 2: called them back when the market opened. The guy again told me they were $600 I asked him to check so he did and came back and said yes they're $6 but as they're sold in sets of 100 that's why all the strike prices are x100. Go figure? Instead of writing $6 X 100 they just write 600. Then he told me as I bought them on the platform and not over the phone they can't refund them. Looks like 💎✋ and pray Tesla goes bankrupt.",35445,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999243617,True
2/23/21 09:53,"$NVDA Long Thesis It’s been a crazy past week+ into today with rising yields and stocks that were on breakout tracks for new highs pulling back.

So what do you do when all hope seems lost?

Idk, I’m not a financial advisor, but what I did was double down.

After experiencing a net loss this year of over $30k with GME, AMC, TSLA, AI, and more, I’m more determined than ever to ignore the pullback while my options bleed in delta and time decay and instead just buy more and hold.

This brings me to NVDA. NVDA is the undisputed king of semiconductors (although some AMD fans try to dispute) with a market cap of $355B and a P/E ratio of 93.83. That P/E ratio is arguably high even for a bull market but let’s be clear, not even 1 week ago NVDA reached a new ATH $614.90 blowing past its previous one of $582ish in this most recent breakout run.

So what has changed from last week to today? Absolutely very little except a massive increase in fear due to a slight 10yr treasury yield increase from 1.25%ish to 1.36%ish. 

A treasury yield increase is actually good as it indicates sentiment from bond holders that the economy will grow faster than expected. Inflation of 1% - 3% is even healthy for large tech companies such as NVDA as they can increase the price higher than the increasing cost resulting in greater earnings, especially in high profit margin areas with its Mellanox acquisition. 

For the fundamentalists in the room that don’t buy stocks because they like the company nor believe in their long-term values, high P/E ratio is justified in believing the E (earnings) will grow higher in the coming year. Chip shortage (indicating growing demand) is expected to continue for another year, https://www.marketwatch.com/story/worldwide-chip-shortage-expected-to-last-into-next-year-and-thats-good-news-for-semiconductor-stocks-11614020156, which will massively increase that earnings potential and the data center will continue to grow with growth from last quarter 162% YoY - https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/nvidias-rapid-data-center-growth-is-here-to-stay/. 

Inflation increases the cost of debt but NVDA doesn’t need debt and has been cash positive for a while. It’s debt-to-assets ratio has been decreasing YoY (short of 2020 because of COVID and growth expenses) and it’s on track for record breaking results this earnings report on Wed.

 🚀🚀🚀 A growing economy is good for profitable companies like NVDA and even if this price is a premium, it’s worth it because NVDA delivers the goods. Even Wall Street agrees with analysts raising PTs to $700. 🚀🚀🚀

Note: I’m long NVDA because you would be crazy not to be.

Warren Buffet said, “... be greedy when others are fearful” and now there is a lot of fear with TSLA and large tech stocks and high valuations. Now is the time to double down in this bullish market because here is the best news, on Wed 2/24, our buddy, Powell, is gonna buy a ton more 10yr bonds driving the price up and yields back down. https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details#current-schedule. And in a few weeks from then, he’s gonna do it again, and then again and again and again. Yield rises will be capped at an upper limit because of $80b/mo coming into them. The Fed has made it very clear that it has no intention of reducing that for years+ as it will allow inflation  to rise beyond 2% to average 2% across a multi-year period. The government wants inflation to rise because it wants to wane away its debt and so there will be Yellen support to keep the money press printing longer than people think. 

In conclusion, patience is key 💎🙌🏼 = 🤑

I’m sure you all heard that the ETF had some issues recently due to Tesla and BC price decrease and lost half a billion in investments in one day which cause the ETF to plummet but I came across something interesting in Yahoo Finance surprisingly. The company immediately got shorted 100% of shares by the vultures. Am I crazy or is that yet again another not only short issue but also a value buy for a ETF that showed 160% returned by mid next week?

2/25/21 16:01,"$BB’s Time Has Come This BaBy is taking off. BB these past 3 weeks has gone through a shit storm and none of us BB holders know why. It is the most undervalued stock I’ve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife’s boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.

Listen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.

Last few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol’ titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that’s just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.

BB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it’s working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China’s google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV’s and use BB’s QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they’ll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry’s QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that’s just the beginning. No we won’t see profit this March because it is yet to boom. 

another product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance. It is basically like CRWD but better. And it’s only one of their products. It’s a subscription based software that protects you as if you were walking down the street with 3 Tyrones backing you up.

IVY - A partnership with AWS(Amazon Web Service) That BB has been working on. It’s basically an App store installed in AV’s, and Blackberry will be the backbone in it. Well knowing Amazon, they don’t fail. And knowing BB, they know how to ensure that nothing around them fails.

This is probably one of those once in a life time chances to get in before the floor goes up. Watch when the revenue starts to kick in, the floor will be 60$, and mark my words.

DISCLAIMER: This is a long term investment, not a get rich in a day kind of stock, but if you are willing to make a solid and rewarding investment, go for it. It may take weeks, to months. But I truly believe that Blackberry is making a revival. And that’s why I yolo’d 80% of my portfolio into this, sold all my BA shares to put more in BB.

Also, I am not a financial advisor, nor am I above average intelligence. This is just me sharing what’s on my mind. And you should take this with a grain of salt.

Positions: 500 @ 12

2/26/21 03:32,"Some basic TSLA Tech Analysis for you Smooth-Brained Apes So, TSLA, along w/ the rest of the Tech stocks is on a downward trajectory, which leads to the obvious question: When does it stop so I can buy in and maximize my upside potential?

I took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:

1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed >10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.
2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.

The stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

2/26/21 01:29,"Lots of Upside with Upwork I posted something similar in r/stocks so I apologize for any redundancy for users of both subs.

Upwork released earnings on Monday after close. Not only did they beat consensus but they raised their guidance rather significantly. More notably, their CEO said that the trend in usage of the platform does *not* seem to be a feature of the pandemic - rather, usership will only go up as we enter re-opening.

For those that don't know, Upwork is kind of like Uber for the gig economy. Economists have been saying this is the future of the job market for years. Say what you will about valuation being stretched (that hasn't seemed to matter the last decade or so), they could be poised to grow massively over the next decade. There is a positive feedback loop as more people adopt the platform. The same way that using Uber, for example, makes you more dependent on using Uber, so does using Upwork. Millennials and Gen Zers have shown a clear desire for career flexibility, which only adds to the bull thesis.

For the sake of this post not just being propaganda, the bear thesis is that it may be overvalued, and that a bigger social media enterprise could build a similar type of platform. To the first, I say maybe, but look at Tesla. To the second, I say, if adoption of the platform is/continues to become significant enough, anyone trying to replicate it will be too late to the party. For example, Facebook has a marketplace now, and have for years, yet eBay is still alive and well, and actually thriving.

This is not financial advice.

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

> * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday’s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday’s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.

> * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday’s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high

> * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.

*****

> # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage

> * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill — which is seen passing the House on Friday — on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.

*****

> # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&J’s single-shot Covid vaccine

> * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn’t have to follow the vaccine committee’s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies’ two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.

*****

> # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO

> * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.

2/26/21 20:45,"Do your own thing, but don't forget where you came from GME is special. Something this good isn't going to happen very often, but it will happen again... sometime.

A little calculus or watching an interview with someone like Drukenmiller will inform you that it only takes a certain number of people getting out  to move the market enough to the sell side, thus removing  the needed support under a price.

I'm not saying it will be a collapse of course; only that the collective buying, continued holding -- any tightly held stock enjoys being expensive to buy  -- and the special stuff a group of inspired people coming together creates, is what will guarantee GME  at or above $300.

What I am saying is that looking for what will be the next great thing, will not find another GME, for now. Things like this tend to happen once and quite spectacularly, but almost never come in twos or threes. YMMV, and there's more money to be made as a retard.

DISCLAIMER:  I'm just saying.  I bought 1 GME share yesterday, and lost 30% between the open and close, and figured as much; I'm now happy to be a part of this.  I have for a while, and continue only holding some amount of gold, for now.

My contention, is if you're long enough GME, you will, in that time probably watch the company do an offering  of as little  as 50M ordinary shares for up to $2B equity, or perhaps raise enough cash   on the back of a fuck-ton of the kind of  advertising you can't buy; like what Elon did at Tesla.  With enough cash to execute the e-commerce strategy, and transition to online, you might find that GameStop was in fact a $200 or $300 company.  This would be the true story of the company.

My point, is that you might do just as well to keep doing the same thing, and holding the line.

This is not any kind of advice of course, just someone's perspective. People should make up their own mind.

2/26/21 15:10,"Possible Correlation? So for this entire week I’ve noticed some interesting stock trends and I wanted to run my question by a few reliable and intelligent minds.  Unfortunately none of them were available, so I’m stuck with my fellow smooth-brained apes.  Hopefully our individual brain cells can work together to answer my question:

Is there a possibility that the dips of every major stock on the market could be caused by shorts selling to cover GME?

I ask because prior to GME rising, the prices of FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL, TSLA, and almost ever other big boy on the market dropped despite the DOW closing at record highs.  I’ve never seen that before.  I’ve owned AAPL for the last six years and I have never (and I mean NEVER) seen the stock drop $2-$3 consecutively for this long.  AAPL has been one of my safest and most consistent investments, so I’m a little surprised.  Especially since they just posted over $100 billion in revenue last quarter.  It doesn’t make sense.  Almost every ticker on my watch list is down by a lot.  Of the 40 tickers currently on my watchlist, GME is the only one in the green.

**Trend:**

TSLA is a momentum stock. It has also historically been a killer of shorts. The average bearish trend on TSLA lasts about a month. The current bearish trend started on 29-Jan-2021, which is more than a month ago.

**Trade strategy:**

Over the last two years, TSLA has delivered more than 5% daily return on 102 trading days. This is compared to 21 days for AAPL and 7 days for S&P 500. In simple words, don't try to time the bottom for TSLA. That would be far more difficult than trying to time the bottom for S&P 500.

*Processing img spac8fwd1kk61...*

TSLA's volatility is more than 100% at the moment. I.e: There is a very high probability of an IV crush over the next two months if one is buying naked options.

So an ideal strategy could be to start buying this dip using covered calls. Covered calls and not shares, because (1) the position is hedged if the bearish trend continues a little longer and (2) benefit from IV crush when trend reverses.

3/1/21 14:29,"We're Gonna Need a Bigger Float - GameStop is a Remix and How to Maybe Profit Off It Whether you are of the opinion that GME is a revolution, a case study in fundamentally broken market rules (naked shorts), a truly good company, or any combination thereof you certainly have to admit that it is unprecedented.

Or it it?

The specifics around the whole Melvin/Robinhood part is, and the new landscape of the internet making data (good or bad) more accessible to the masses will certainly be creating new rules about how the markets function. But, in the pure form of a short squeeze this is in fact a case of ""there's nothing new under the sun.""

Most have become familiar with the Volkswagen squeeze that occurred in 2008, as it has been touted as the most direct short squeeze comparison. Chart photo below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/st5n6zjngck61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b5f0c118efebc43b115246a09e10744c01eee1

Tesla has also been compared to the GameStop situation but that was arguably a slower burn and to be fair had been on a steady march upward leading to the explosive growth in 2020.

But there is another squeeze that occurred in 1901 that might provide a better comparison to GameStop not in terms of its cause and setup, but the potential secondary effect.

**The Great Panic of 1901**

Leading up to 1901 the Union Pacific railroad had been on an acquisition tear becoming the largest rail player in the West under the leadership of Edward Henry Herriman and backed by a syndicate that included the likes of Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Goulds, Ameses and Kuhn, Loed & Co. (read as ""people who don't like to lose"").

But, in order to expand East a key acquisition had to be made. That acquisition was the Chicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad. However, James Hill through the backing of J.P. Morgan (also read as ""someone who doesn't like to lose""), controlled the Northern Pacific Railroad and had similar ideas for expansion.

A back and forth bidding war for the Burlington Railway ensued which ended in Hill being chosen and Hill proposing a Burlington and Northern Pacific merger. But, Hill and Morgan did not hold outright ownership of Northern Pacific and collectively held roughly 23% interest. Believing that the $155M or so needed to gain the controlling stake in Northern was of no issue they pressed on with the Burlington merger.

Meanwhile, Harriman quietly began buying the majority of Northern's preferred shares and about $37M in common stock putting him within 40,000 common shares of control.

On May 6th, after getting tipped off of the activity, Hill and Morgan began frantically buying up common shares on the open market to block this attempt sending the share price from $110 to $130. Not wanting to announce their activity, great effort was put towards masking their buying and the general market remained unaware of the tug of war that was occurring between the two railway giants.

Believing that the price hike was artificial, traders began shorting the Northern Pacific stock.

Here is an excerpt from *The American Magazine 1907* to give an idea of the climate at the time, it carries some similarities to today:

*""It is important to understand the mood of the time. Ordinary investors had recently been worked into a frenzy as U.S. Steel shares were promoted and railroad stocks were rising fast on various rumors of insider accumulations and mergers. Lefevre recounts a ""raging public speculation in stocks"" while Clew talks of a ""restless sea of reckless stock speculation that swept the American people into its vortex, with all its razzle-dazzle extravagance.""""*

By the next day the Northern Pacific shares were up to $150 and short sellers were weighing whether to close the position and take the loss or to liquidate other holdings to remain solvent. The following day, that decision was forced upon them as the stock climbed to $200.

By this point Hill had successfully seized control, yet neither side was going to sell and jeopardize what they each believed to be the controlling stake. As the market realized there was not going to be enough share volume to close short positions the price climbed to $1000 a share. Fearing the deadline to deliver, short sellers began dumping everything to cover their Pacific Northern losses and margin rates spiked to 60% only compounding the issue.

This created a panic in the broader market and following the lead of the short sellers the entire market sold off. The short sellers lost somewhere between $40M-$70M in the mayhem but those who sold in the broader market dip got burned as well.

Overall, the total pain felt was short lived and smaller than it could have been. Realizing what was occurring Hill and Harriman reached a truce and agreed to allow positions to be closed out at $160 a share. This allowed markets to stabilize and return to previous levels, not to mention save some of the short sellers from ruin.

**How Does This Mimic Today?**

An interesting take away from this story that has some value in today's situation is first that margin played a key role in causing a broader sell off and second that the stabilization came from two whales calling a cease fire.

Today margin is at a record level, almost at the COMBINED amounts leading up to the internet and housing bubbles, even after adjusting for inflation.

Some data on these levels further down in the post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueSqueeze/comments/lpftk7/investor_gardening_101_know_when_its_time_to/)

So, should the GameStop situation run away to a sufficient level, we can expect the incentive to sell due to margin will work its magic. Kind of like dry wood building up in a forest waiting for a fire.

A bit of an instance of ""correlation does not equal causation,"" but it seems that when GameStop goes up the broader market does tend to sell off.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wb2hq9pqgck61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=a603988fe3cad8c2ddc2e03ad205f3de2b1b83f4

Some statistical data I've seen from various sources keeps landing at about a -0.50 correlation to the indices with a T-stat of < 0.05, which means a low likelihood of random chance correlation.

Eh, maybe a stretch but I bet the inverse correlation gets stronger as GameStop goes from $200 to $400 to $800 etc.

*Now for the scary part,* in the above example two whales met in the middle to call an end to all of the madness. I suspect there will be no such ""bailout"" in today's case. A quick review of the sentiment around the GameStop revolution shows that convincing a diverse population of shareholders who see this as more of a crusade rather than merely a profit endeavor is going to be an uphill battle should the price keep rising.

And good on them, but should 1901 repeat itself the SEC may have to force some hands. We've already seen brokers take matters into their own hands.

**How Not to Burn Your Hands and Maybe Get a Chance to Profit**

If you are profit motivated, you could of course try and time an entry into GameStop if you expect the squeeze has not happened and that the best is yet to come.

But, assuming the above is a good proxy for what could happen, might that be the best way to approach the situation?

If you are on board for the revolution by all means take what money you can afford to lose and join the cause. But, for those dollars above and beyond this amount, the ones you have to make calculated bets with, can some second order thinking provide fantastic risk adjusted returns?

**The easy way** would be to mimic what a certain Bernard Baruch (a trader on the floor at the time) did in 1901. A quote from him during the panic:

*""On the Exchange floor fear had completely taken the place of reason. Stocks were being dumped wildly, dropping from ten to twenty points. There were rumors of corners in other stocks \[in addition to Northern\].""*

Baruch realized what was going on and he bought heavily in the drop. He knew great companies were being sold at fire sale prices and he took full advantage.

To follow his lead in today's situation would be to have some DD already done on companies you'd love to own, make sure the cash is available and see if some fireworks happen.

**The hard way** would be to actually put on a short. Which does not have to be done *prior* to some positive movement from GameStop. But ask yourself, in a selloff situation what is likely to happen?

Most probable would be a flight to safety. So, if you are a trader, going short growth companies as GameStop makes some serious moves upward may be the safest short equity bet. Historically speaking people are most eager to let go of those companies that have yet to grow into their multiples (think high P/E ratios).

Regardless of the method that works best for you, which of course depends on existing positions, risk tolerance, etc. the current situation has the potential to create a low risk high reward outcomes as a secondary effect. We already have a historical data point to look to and the dry tinder waiting behind that one was a fraction of what we have today.

Some thought put towards a response to this possible outcome may prove to be profitable. And for those solely seeing this as a movement, that secondary effect would still mostly be at the expense of the institutions.

3/1/21 05:06,"Is NIO ready to skyrocket in 2021? There are many EV manufactures in China (the largest EV market in the world) but NIO is one that always called my attention because of their design, innovation and sales volumes. This brought me to create a projection based on past deliveries, and noticed that  **NIO** might sell more cars in China this December than Tesla. It seems hard to believe but that's why I have attached a table with the raw data so you can do the projection by yourselves. Another point that I’ve considered, was that when comparing January 2021 deliveries to last December, Tesla dropped 35% while **NIO** increased its deliveries by 3%. This is not a lot, but compared to January 2019 NIO increased an impressive 325%.

February **NIO**'s vehicles delivery which is supposed to go out next week will be key to confirm this trend. February of last year was a bad months for **NIO** given the Chinese New Year, and the pandemic. However, if **NIO** was able to deliver more than 1,000 vehicles in February 2021, then it should deliver more that 100,000 total cars in 2021, and maybe overtake Tesla in December as the top EV supplier in China. If achieved, this will mark a big milestone for **NIO**. Sure that 100,000 is shy of the 800.000 cars delivery expected for Tesla in 2021, but it took Tesla 6 years to reach 100,000 vehicles, while NIO might achieve this important milestone in it's forth year. It’s also important to mention that February is a slow month for car sales in China because of the new year celebrations, therefore all vehicles' manufacturers are expected to report lower sales than in other months.

Usually **NIO** announces past month’s car delivery at the beginning of the following month, so most likely next week we’ll know how many cars were delivered in February 2021.

I owned 6,000 **NIO**'s shares, and after the price dropped last week I sold 1,000 of my **NIO** shares and bought 150 5 March 21 $50 Call Options with the proceeds.

3/1/21 05:01,"BB - a long and factual look at Chen's hints and predictions during earnings calls It's weekend, going outside is illegal, and I'm bored. I started my own DD into BB by looking up the most relevant recent information. If y'all don't feel like reading through the earnings calls transcripts, etc, I've put together a little summary. :) Figured I might as well post it here - if only for my personal records/safekeeping. (Automod deletes posts with links to certain sites, so you'll have to seek out the earnings transcripts yourselves, unfortunately.) Enjoy.

 

**Blackberry Q2 earnings transcript, 9/24/20.** 

 Most interesting (to me) takeaways: they're lobbying the US and Canadian governments to get more contracts; approaching other governments as well; trying to work with individual states, though pricing is an issue there. Chen recognizes that his sales people suck - that structure is being changed.

 

**December 2020:**

The AWS deal is already priced in: the 50% spike in December 2020. Bullish articles from analysts: what if it partners up with Tesla as well?

&#x200B;

**Blackberry Q3 earnings transcript, 12/17/20:** 

Added a lot of federal government clients as well as the Bank of India and the Government of Rwanda. (How random is that?)

BB's AtHoc (secure communication) now owns the entire state of California.

Referring to the AWS partnership announcement: ""Combined, we’re able to provide a full end-to-end platform."" Hmmmm, this is probably just wishful thinking, but Amazon loves owning end-to-end stuff... I don't think they'll buy BB, but the potential is always there - just like they bought Goodreads, [Diapers.com](https://diapers.com/), etc.

BB's goal for integration in an actual car is 2023: until then, it'll remain in development. We won't see any subscription revenue this year or next, but there might be interesting announcements on more automakers partnering up with BB.

Annual Recurring Revenue is decreasing for the second quarter in a row. They expect it to go up when the covid mess gets better, meaning Q1-ish. Implication: it'll still suck in Q4.

Partnerships with Zoom, Verizon, and Microsoft.

Curious: papa Chen specified that his sales folks are using the SolarWinds hack (which didn't affect BB) as a big selling point. (Should we expect more sales revenue in Q4, then?..)

IVY beta version should be ready in September 2021. The developer version should be ready in mid-2021.

They're wooing 20 different electric vehicle manufacturers. Once they sign up, public announcements will follow if the manufacturers are fine with that.

Papa Chen name-drops Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS - and the upcoming CEO of Amazon later in 2021. Says ""He specifically spent quite a bit of time on how this particular -- this relationship. So you can see that they are very serious. This seriousness not only come from the cloud side, but it comes from the IoT side also at Amazon.""

The IVY revenue will be split with AWS.

 

**January 2021:**

The catalyst for the spike to $20 was the news about the Facebook settlement. However, none of the details of the settlement were disclosed. (Articles don't mention WSB as the catalyst. Heh.)

&#x200B;

**My thoughts:**

1. The Facebook settlement news is interesting... That alone was enough to spike the price, which has since fallen by \~50%. Once the details are announced (on the 3/31 earnings call?), that alone might drive another price spike depending on how much money BB is getting.
2. Q4 earnings won't be announced until late March (3/31?). Sounds like they made a lot of new sales in Q4 by pointing out that the SolarWinds hack didn't affect them.

2a. More government contracts based on how badly the hack affected them?

3. Papa Chen might make new announcements about new electric vehicle partnerships at any time. I suspect if there will be big announcements, they will come before the earnings call, just like the AWS news dropped before the late-December call.

4. IVY developer version will drop in mid-2021. That might generate some headlines at long last.

5. This is the big one. Andy Jassy will take over Amazon from Jeff Bezos in Q3. Jassy is on record as a fan of Blackberry. That is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge. Read the Q3 earnings transcript: papa Chen and Jassy have a bromance. Unlike all the other developments, I don't think we'll have to wait for years and years until we start getting some interesting headlines from the AWS/BB team-up.

6. Papa Chen has not given any interviews at all in 2021. As far as I can tell, he hasn't made any public comments at all about the spike and the crash of his stock. Interesting. The guy is smart and he knows when to keep his mouth shut.

7. The Facebook settlement. The giant gorilla in the room. We still don't know how much money we're talking about here. That was one of the key things (aside from WSB haha) that spiked the stock in January. That's still a huge wildcard. The settlement's details will most likely be revealed either before the earnings call (mid-March?) or during the call. I don't think it's baked into the current stock price because right now BB is trading at pre-Facebook-announcement levels. Once the news is announced, it could be nothing, or it could drive another huge spike in price. And if that announcement is combined with some other good news... Well, I hope the guys that short BB will have enough to cover. :)

**tl;dr** \- BB has **a ton** of potential. I've been averaging down and holding because I like the stock. I'm not an advisor, this isn't for educational purposes, this is purely for entertainment.

Last week was a good week for all the Tesla sceptics who are waiting for the so-called ""Hype"" to be over and the price to drop. But are they right? Let's look at some of the macro and micro trends and let's see where the share price could be possibly heading.

**1. Macro:**

* In the US, Biden has made it clear that the EV boom is just getting started. This means, that those who are already ahead of the curve are in a very strong position.
* He made it clear that we are going to see a major shift, stating he plans to replace the entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles.
* That includes 245,000 in various federal agencies… 225,000 in the United States Postal Service… and another 173,000 in the military.
* That adds up to a grand total of 643,000 cars, trucks, and vans set for an upgrade on the U.S. government’s dime. 
* Also across the world, more countries are following or have already started.
* For example, Norway imposed several changes in the government years ago just like the United States, and it’s led to a sweeping transformation. 
* In fact, 54% of all vehicles sold in the country last year were electric vehicles.

**2. Micro:**

* Tesla's forecast in terms of deliveries is looking very promising.
* Deliveries are expected to rise from about 500,000 last year to 894,000 this year and 5 million by 2024. By 2030, annual deliveries could climb to about 9 million.
* This is mainly due to increased efficiencies in the production and new productions plants being built in China, Germany and Texas
* Some analysts also expect that Tesla could be generating 37bn free cash flow by 2025; just as a comparison Facebook is currently generation 23bn.

To summarise: Before any sceptics get too happy, Tesla is still a very much hold for us and some well-known analysts even anticipate the **price to head towards $1200 next year**.

Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.

*Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).

In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.

As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**

**Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**

Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.

Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.

Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)

**What is their current situation?**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99

https://preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4

As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.

**Options/Puts**

https://preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598

Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.

**Volume**

Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.

https://preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e

As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.

[  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https://preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)

Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)

**Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**

But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.

**Q4 report and team guidance**

So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen. Link [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/root-inc-root-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/root-inc-root-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

EDIT: FORGOT TO MENTION, in the earnings call they say **they have FUCKING $1.1 BILLION in cash** and cash equivalents at Root, Inc. and outside of regulated insurance entities with an additional $255 million in cash and investments at insurance subsidiaries. This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**

**TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).

**TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Do your own diligence, do not message me on what to do or not to do, hate or love me, I am just sharing it here since I got banned on other subreddit for mentioning a digital currency couple of times in a row, lol.

**To end, I believe this company is undervalued, shorted, earning transcript showed me they are bound to comeback, good for short term small gains and long-term big gains.**

 Nickel supply bottlenecks are the biggest concern for Tesla as it scale up lithium-ion cell production.

 That would be the reason why Tesla is switching its models with standard range to iron cathodes.

3/3/21 13:53,"General Motors $GM - PT $500 coming soon, DD inside Hi fellow WSB,

$GM has some real potential to bring me some generational wealth. $500 PT. Yes, you heard that right. 

1.	GM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles. 

2.	GM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.

3.	GM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.

4.	GM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.

5.	GM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge! 

6.	Apple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.

7.	Famous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.

8.	President Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.

9.	Chip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.

10.	Newly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).

Megabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do! Position below. Cheers guys.

3/3/21 12:00,"How to find the Next thing (foreal) **Step 1:** switch that ""hot"" button to sort by ""new""

**Step 2:** ignore all things that say GME,  or RKT, or whatever the next big thing is at that time

**step 3:** look at all other tickers, if they are related to GME or RKT rather then just dd in any way (mortgage company like rkt, heavily shorted for gme) ignore it they're likely just after the hype caused by the rush.

**Step 4**: You've found a stock, coo, now look at its financials what's its share holders equity what's its net income? what's its market value? and how much do you weigh each of these? that's a personal thing, a lot of people have taken the stance that fundamentals are useless now siting TSLA and the like but that's still the easiest way to sort through the shit if you ask me.

**Step 5:** look for news, what's the sentiment? what are the aims its going for and when is this going to be revealed? you want something that has a clear way to burst through the market OTHER THEN EARNINGS, earnings are nice but it needs a clear cut reason it should go off. RKT's PE ratio was insanely good for its sector and what it was making giving it a clear cut above the rest.

**Step 6:** buy in with a A PORTION of your money into a call/put/stock based on your own taste. the more your in the market, the more you'll understand what your looking for better. i personally like to aim for previous lows within a bullish run.

**Step 7: Profit? lmao probably not**, i said to use a portion cause everything i said can help give you a better shot but lets be real here, **your using a sub who calls each other autists and retards, that recently got swamped with people who have no real stock knowledge,  when we were already struggling in the knowledge department before hand lmao.

Edit: A lot of people are putting ""I followed this and found xxx stock"" and let me tell you i hate most of their financials, JS, yall got some shitty understandings of step 4-5.

I want to start off this DD with the standard statements. This is not financial advice and I am NOT a financial advisor! I just really like this stock. 

Quick history lesson for you apes, Microvision is an old company, older than you (probably). These mamma jammas have been slanging since ‘96. What business have they been in you may be wondering? The future mother fucker. VR, Augmented Reality, Laser Imaging. These people grew up in the ‘90’s watching shit like Terminator 2, Starship Troopers, The Matrix. They watched these futuristic films and thought to get ahead of the curve and get into the business of future tech early. 

Microvision is headquartered in Washington, and as a tech company that’s a big deal. That means they aren't an overvalued silicon value trust fund baby. To viciously oversimplify what this company is vested in; their tech is applied to display applications ( Projections / VR), sensing (LiDAR), and Display and Sensing ( ??Augmented Reality?? ). 

The only application of their tech I give a single fuck about is the automotive sensing. Sure VR is great for when I’m watching my Brazzers and I really want to feel like I’m getting laid since I am too afraid to go outside or talk to people in the real world, but on a large scale economic evaluation the VR industry is a moot point. 

$TSLA (Shameless papa Elon Simp) is arguably the best current automotive manufacturer on the planet. Every other automotive manufacturer is looking to take some pointers from them and start down their own path of autonomous driving. When it comes to autonomous driving there are 3 different types of technology that can be used to achieve this. Camera sensors, Radar sensors, and LiDAR sensors. Please go through this informative piece to educate yourself on autonomous driving you silly mongoloid. 

[https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:\~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars](https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars). 

TL&DR : Of the three major sensors, LiDAR is the best in terms of quality of sensing, but the drawback to this technology is the cost of use. When it comes to LiDAR there are two major types of sensor arrays, ones that spin and move a bunch and ones that don’t. Can you guess which ones would be more preferred by an automobile manufacturer? \*\*\* hint it doesn't move \*\*\*

Microvision has released a statement that it is now able to build a stationary LiDAR sensor around a sub-$1000 price point and this sensor will meet all of the specifications set by car manufacturers. 

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15)

On Feb 15 Ford dissolved their stake in a different LiDAR company, Velodyne. Coincidence ? I think not. This tells us two very important things about this tech and the direction of the automotive industry. First, automotive manufacturers see the value in LiDAR as the technology of choice for autonomous vehicles. Next, they are positioning themselves well ahead of the curve to be seeded in the correct positions to win.

MVIS was just officially granted a patent on it’s tech. On April 4, 2021 automotive manufacturers will  finally be able to get their hands on these sensors and (assuming they meet all OEM requirements like they already said they can) MVIS is more than well positioned to be the LiDAR company of choice for all automotive manufacturers looking to enter the autonomous driving industry. As manufacturers they have already shown their investments into this technology will come early and fast. It is impossible for anyone to predict if the company will be acquired or if they will lease/partner up, but all the information points to the rapid success of MVIS in the automotive sensors industry.  With all that being said I just really like the stock. MVIS go moon.",37802,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999839544,True
3/5/21 16:59,"GME IS THE MOTHER OF ALL SQUEEZES What’s happening to NIO and the rest of the big name stock like Apple and Tesla? I’ll tell you:

Most have you must have heard of rising interest rates in the U.S and that is the supposed reason to why the market is taking a slight dip. Well it’s not the reason. It’s fake news. 

Here’s what going on. The market is taking a slight dip because institutional investors are selling their shares of these big growth stocks. Why are they selling? They are selling because of the whole GME fiasco. GME has not been squeezed yet and that is a fact. You will see media like CNBC saying that Melvin capital is done with GME or that there is nothing left to squeeze. That is all false. It’s FAKE NEWS! The reason why they are taking away the spotlight from GME is because they know that the SP will hit at least $60,000 USD. I know that most of you think it sounds far fetched but it’s not. 

Hear me out: once GME rockets past $60,000 USD a share what will most retail investors do? They will sell. What will most do with their new found wealth? They will look for other stocks like NIO, Tesla, Apple, and etc.... the list goes on. How will they know which one to choose though? Of course most people will go for the lowest stock price and highest return rate. 

Do you see where I’m going with this? Wall Street is manipulating the market to create a dip. They want retail investors that profit from GME to buy more shares while the market is red. Why would they do that? Same reason you might put your money into those growth stocks in the first place. They want a high return. Once retail investors flood the growths stocks with their GME profits, Wall St will piggy back on us and drive the price even higher than before. This is what’s happening.

Don’t listen to shills or fake news media.

It’s pure manipulation. Just be ready and buy the dips as much as possible. Individual retail investors are not selling. It’s only the big guys. Look at most of the charts from this past week. Compare NIO to Apple and Apple to Tesla. It’s the same. The list goes on? If the charts are the same that means all investors are thinking the same thing right? No. It was planned. The stimulus checks that the U.S will be providing, where will it all go? Into the market! Once all that plus GME profits go into the market WALL ST will buy back! Hold your shares and buy the dips. This is manipulation at its finest. Once Wall St is done poking it’s fingers everywhere, the market will be more bullish than ever before.

I sware today I kept the edible mg low, took my adderall with water rather than Redbull, & only had one shot of vodka with my supplement drink after my morning workout.   
Any way.  I’m coherent & here is my issue my deranged brain can’t figure out.        My TD AMERITRADE is supposed to NOT send my info to companies I invest in.  & for years they have not, other than emails on Tesla     But as of lately the last couple weeks when I check the mail expecting my boner pills to show I’ve been getting  a couple letters from companies that I had been invested in on either shareholder news , stock offerings or ceo voting.      Weird right ?    They are direct from the company & nothing to do with TD Ameritrade.   ( so I’m not throwing TD under the bus).    Just stating it’s odd I’ve never gotten anything over the years & even double checked that I wasn’t soo shitfaced that I grabbed my neighbor’s mail by accident.  
But,   The weird thing is also , on TD Ameritrade everyday I get the news alerts saying WSB top 20 picks...      problem is.    When I’m not looking at porn I’ve constantly been looking on WSB everything & I don’t see ANYTHING ANYWHERE that anybody has posted mentioning at least 1/2 of the tickers they so call claim as (WSB top 20).          & manipulation isn’t happening??                The clowns want to eliminate retail traders from trading apps.  But BIG TECH is the power house that won’t allow that with all the profits rolling in.   So the second strategy is to eliminate the ability of retail investors to trade options.        But,  with that not being an immediate thing that can happen justifiably , they somehow decide to create a way to make the market soo choppy that it’s impossible to know wether to place a Calls or Puts because every stock has become extremely volatile the last few days.

I’m NOT selling.  & I’m NOT going to use media propaganda to determine what Stonk I need to invest in.

1. 3/19 - 5x 23C
2. 3/19 - 24x 27C
3. 3/19- 30x 26C

AMKR provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. It provides essential services to companies that deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and works with big names such as NVIDA, Sony, Tesla

***1.*** ***Financials are great***

5B of revenue, 5B Cap, criminally low P/E of 17.7

Okay, but what about other companies in semi-cons. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17.  AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79. This alone tells you how  undervalued this company is. Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

The company is constantly reducing it’s debt and increasing operating income and it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends too.

Low volume

Great financials

***2.*** ***Company is in a hot, growing space.***

Semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board.Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon..

***3. Outlook is great:***

last earnings call says that everything is going great and growing HUGE -

“Okay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor’s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021”

To summarize:

1. Great outlook
2. Best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. Great revenue and P/E

While I wait for one of Papa Musks celestial tweets I found a pretty decent short term play in Costco earnings after hours today. It almost feels like free money.....almost cuz the market is probably gonna take a poo poo.

Price per share is currently at $322.25 with expected eps of 2.42. That’s a 15% increase YoY and that’s not even accounting for the fact that they most likely will be reporting 2.45-2.52 EPS. Have you been to a Costco lately?  The day of Q2 earnings, the price per share reached a high of $314. There is a huge discrepancy between current price and fair value.

Costco is the only company that is competing with Amazon because they have a loyal customer base that is seeking true value in their products. The current price drop is not correlated to business financials but short term sentiment drop on the macro level. 

Have you been to a Costco lately?They’re packed every time I go and come on, can you beat $1.50 hot dog and soda. NO.

If you’re looking for a way to profit from the popping of this tech bubble you’re gonna wanna go balls deep in $SQQQ. This is 3x inverse exposure so if your risk tolerance is low then go the fuck home and buy some ETF’s. SQ is no where even close to its 52 week high and it’s gonna keep climbing at least until the stimmies are issued and a little life is injected in this market. Yes the economy is fine but the stock market and particularly the tech industry are going to continue to see plenty of red days in the near future. Disclaimer: I’m literally on the spectrum.

Edit: The fact that most of WSB is against this move makes me love it even more. Gonna double down at open tomorrow. Thank you tards but I know this isn’t a long term play I’m riding it into tomorrow afternoon. Unsure if I’ll hold through the weekend yet.

The stock dip seems a little extreme compared to any of the potentially negative public news rumors that I've read:  


* There was a two-week production line shut down due to battery supply issues that have been restarted.
* Price cut to Japan car imports.
* Discussion of federal interest rate hikes that could affect growth stocks that were later alleviated to some degree.
* Tesla did not announce a hard number for expected deliveries for 2021. Instead, they said that they expect more than 50% growth this year due to a doubling of their gigafactories.
* Tesla bought $1.5 billion of digit currency which opens them up to additional risk
* Ford Mustang EV has launched, though the number of units sold has been quite minimal  


I read in a number of articles that TSLA is the number one shorted stock. I wonder how much that may be affecting the current stock price. With their new factories, the price of their digital currency, new CyberTruck, new tradeable, automotive regulatory tax credits, and the new EV tax credits being discussed. I was leaning towards 2021 being another big year for TSLA.

(1) [The Ishares Russell 2000 Growth ETF which measures growth stocks (think tech, TSLA, ARKK and others with higher P/E ratios) over the 6 month appears to be falling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w3FSUWd1ZCzWSyKVvAniCtVs5rizD-8W/view?usp=sharing). MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) dropped below 0. The slope of the line is similar to that observed in March 2020.

(2) [Momentum (a measure of the continuity of the existing trend) dropped below the 4-month moving average.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q76e2j_V1m6eqkMW-9Q5IuOaBH1pSxCW/view?usp=sharing) This only happened twice in the last year – once in November, at which point it bounced and retraced, and the second time in March 2020. MACD is breaking below 0 at a rate not seen since March 2020. RSI is below 50 and dropping at a high rate of speed..

(3) The VIX – a measure of market volatility. [The one-year trend suggests a flag/pennant pattern indicative of consolidation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1swR1oymlPbZrWEne5Q0aW1gnlZdUtTFY/view?usp=sharing).

On the 1-month scale, [the indicators suggest an upward breakout will occur](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEy8548Ns1b7Y8EMgx6VsYK8JIbmInnL/view?usp=sharing).

(4) [SQQQ (a short-index of the NASDAQ) trends on the 3-month indicate a convergence in moving averages, with MACD above 0 and increasing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYQP1_yUJu-DywAeMXS7MhITqm3pdhGH/view?usp=sharing). RSI has been at or above 50 since February. The slope of the RSI and MACD lines indicate the trend is set to continue.

3/5/21 12:41,"NNOX shorted, FDA 510k incoming, disruptive technology, stock at insanely undervalued price, was shorted by Citron in the past (so was Tesla) Edit: It seems that, whether it be fomo or just the shitty day the market had today, most people have strong feelings against NNOX. Read my replies, and my half ass DD, and look into the company yourself. You have to be optimistic and not shut down anything that’s not being pumped and not make yourself believe disruptive technology doesn’t exist. I was attempting to help point out a ridiculous terribly undervalued stock but if disruptive tech isn’t for you then that’s ok. 

Think of NNOX like like Elon Musk when he was an infant, and you are a couple who is unable to have kids so they go adopt a kid, and turns out you adopted the soon to be richest man alive. An infant company soon to become one of the largest disruptive technology businesses of the decade, that just graduated from middle school and is off to high school where he will decide what he wants to do with his life. When he graduates, he asks to be able to comeback home after college, and your job as his parent is to say yes or no. He really wants to and says he will never talk to you again if you say no. As he seems to be worth nothing and no benefit to society, you say no. Turns out he goes off to college and graduates and becomes the richest man alive. The only issue is, he won't talk to you, or even look at you, because he's to busy being a multi billionaire. You are now wishing you took him back in after college. Don't not take in this business once it graduates from college (and begins manufacturing and selling product).

&#x200B;

I have been in NNOX since the beginning, and wish I bought at the price it's at now every time it dipped. Although it is the Tesla of x-rays, NNOX has no sales and are waiting on FDA approval which is to be obtained within 30 days (after they had a additional information request). The graph shows the hype when it first went public, then when it was shorted by Citron, and then its live demo, and then retail investors (who own majority of the float) getting bored and selling / panic selling in current market conditions. Not necessarily a DD but something that you ought to look into. Insanely disruptive technology that early investors get rewarded for holding before the hype takes over and goes to the moon (like Tesla) when Citron shorted it. Nano-X Imaging Ltd is the official name and NNOX is the ticker.

3/5/21 10:47,"Tech stocks being in a bubble is a lie. Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population.

Month to date my EV positions are down 40%, so wanted to put things in perspective for a few fellow WSB, and I’ll make it short. 3 points

1. See the forest for the trees
Down 20% a dah is hard but if your investment thesis is centered around if a company double/triples on a 3-5 year horizon , why the fuck do you care if it’s down 20% cuz everything is a dump today? Manage your leverage - hold stock / roll options forward/buy itm options where u r not paying dealers free theta money - to live to fight long term. I attached an interview for a big tech hf, watch his first point on investment philosophy:

Ok on YouTube search ‘Philippe Laffont, CEO Founder and CEO of Coatue Management - Part II’

Having a 3-5 year horizon IMO is lot more profound/ harder than it sounds. Mkt is near term, and risk premium/or in a way alpha beyond market beta risk, is embedded in being able to stomach the near term volatility and hold the position long term - granted ur thesis remains intact. 

2. Put rates in perspective
Too much talks on rates. 1.60 on 10s scared the sht out of the mkt so far in March. But I’d say it should scare the sht out of bond guys a lot more than equities because if you put things in perspective, TSLA is aiming to increase delivery by 50% on an annual basis - that’s just their car business; Cathy wood thinks EV Global sales is coumpounding 82% annualized rate during the next five years. Her fund is down she’s coming out more to talk her book, I get it. I expect people to say that.
1.6% vs 50-80% , it’s all priced in right ?🤡

3. Risk management, cyclical rotation, etc
Now ppl gonna say you down 40% a week on EV that’s retarded- you could’ve stopped loss/added hedges/rotated into energy stocks - u probably right. you also hear all the mmgr on CNBC talking about rotation into cyclical/energy/small cap blah blah blah. If you are a professional institutional stock picker or indexer, you had to follow the market flow and buy into where the sentiment is - and yea you really expected any of them to say something original ??..  If You can do that and always be up , you don’t need to read this, you can just go buy a lottery ticket and make 100mm$, but just know that where the news is gets crowded. Assume most of us have a day job/study, don’t have the time/or alpha to time mkt, I just stay in where my conviction is , and wait for the other side of the tunnel .

1. Let’s talk about Cathie’s call on TSLA hitting $4k ($800 post-split). As you guys know from my posts and comments (if you’ve seen me around), I’m a longtime TSLA bull. Fortunately, I am also no longer a broke grad student, and I have Elon to thank for that.

Cathie’s bet was one I agreed with when she made it. In fact, I still agree with it. The problem is, we hit that crazy number *two years early.* I have a re-entry plan for TSLA, maybe it’ll happen maybe it won’t, but the point is, *according to Cathie’s own thesis* TSLA was ahead of itself by *two years* AND SHE BOUGHT MORE. A lot more. “According to Cathie’s own thesis” is the focal point here. Now, in a vacuum, this isn’t super massive. For example, Blackrock bought tons of TSLA at $800. But this becomes an issue when you combine it with the next few points. 

2. Tilt. I’ve gotten into poker recently. On the swing trades I occasionally play, it’s actually improved my skills noticeably. Why? I recognize my tilt. Tilt is your emotion whilst gambling- the tug making you angry at the market, or the flush that just beat you. To the point about TSLA being overvalued by Cathie’s own standards - this *hints* toward tilt. I think it’s entirely possible she sees TSLA as a stock instead of a *bargain* which is what a fund manager should be looking for. I mean, why else would she practically double her stake at these crazy prices? Additionally, if anyone hasn’t heard her talk about how God influences her, the shit is weird. Yes, that’s why the funds are called Ark. I don’t trust people who allow God and financial decisions in the same room- hell, the same city. Why? Tilt. Tl;dr short $GOD.

3. Mean regression. When the senate turned blue, I hopped on ICLN. When it hit $32 or so, I hopped right back off. Why? Back when Obama became president, the same shit happened- hype for green energy went through the roof, stonks went up on speculation, and... nothing happened. Same with weed every few years. It’s sell the news on steroids. 

Cathie’s general return on ARKW, as an example fund, is about 40%. The 1yr is about *156%*. Much like Tesla, this is something that could have easily kept going up, and we could still have a spirited debate about the next six months. But what about the next six years? 

I generally like Cathie’s holdings. She has a few that straight-up suck, like the 3D printer thing, but mostly they’re pretty agreeable. But I’m reminded of a video from ‘99 of an older guy telling Warren Buffett that he made 100% on tech stocks and asked him if it’s too much to ask him to use his brain and give similar returns to his investors. *Lmao* 

Buffett shut him the fuck down, saying basically we aim to beat the market modestly (he beat market by 20%-ish for decades lol) because flying high puts you in the Icarus zone, but if anyone wants to invest with you instead of us, give em some business cards. 

If you strongly believe in Cathie and think she can maintain 40% gains YoY (I don’t), then she’s due for a correction, even from the current prices. Eyeballing it, Id say a correction of about 24-40%. If you believe that, like ICLN, many of her stocks are propped up by really low bond yields and market-wide hopium, you’re looking at a deeper and more sustained correction. Again, **I like a lot of Cathie’s holdings**. But stocks moving this much in this period of time are not sustainable growth machines, they’re speculative in nature and as such **many will end up falling**. Look at /u/deepfuckingvalue portfolio on his youtube channel- dude made a lot of small speculative plays betting probably 60% would net him a nice profit. This is not being priced in right now with Ark, lots of morons just think every stock she has is gonna moon forever. Which brings me to my final point...

4. Cathie’s main audience is young retail high on hopium. Let’s look at retail tilt: 
- Most traders who invest in risky shit are men (go through this sub for one day, it’s obvious). [Men are more likely to bet on past performance and hubris than women. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4736715/) . But past performance and hubris are NOT GOOD INDICATORS. 
- Traders who see a 150% 1yr gain on a fucking *mutual fund* and decide now’s the time to go all-in are lacking patience and perspective. They want a quick buck. It’s like FD’s on steroids. 
- Even those with a longer-term perspective (which is silly, for reasons I outlined) will be forced to watch their already tiny and impotent stacks get burned for weeks and weeks and weeks, and will most likely bitch out. Then, they’ll FOMO on a dead cat bounce. Then, they’ll bitch out again. For those who learn from the mistake and become actual traders, this will be referred to lovingly as their first big loss. 

Now let’s look at Berkshire again. Who invests in Berkshire? Who EVER invested in Berkshire? People who are comfortable with two old as fuck guys using their competitive advantage (acquisition) and eye for companies with strong dividends, balance sheets, growth prospects, and leadership and giving them money for decades. Look at BRK’s all time chart vs ARK-anything’s all time chart. 

Looking at Cathie’s holdings, I can probably name like 4 that are actually profitable AT ALL, nevermind reporting strong earnings and a respectable balance sheet. If BRK has a bad year, it doesn’t matter, because a bad year for them is down a bit and more investors will pile on and hold forever because their fundamentals are beyond rock solid. For ARK? A few months of retail’s “savage young robinhood hustlers” shitting their pants cause they lost $450.67 and running with their supreme between their legs could be enough to cause them a liquidity crisis, and if not that, it’ll force them into a position where they have to sell profitable positions to maintain liquidity. 

So anyway, that’s my long term 🌈🐻 thesis on Ark. I think ARKF is the only one which may actually do well long term, and ARKG *possibly*, if you’re willing to hold for like 20 years (srs) and get lucky. But neither are a solid cop right now and neither should be massive stakes in your portfolio. **I mean, don’t you think it’s funny how every single Ark chart looks EXACTLY the same for the past 12 months, despite being in wildly different sectors? It’s almost as if the returns are based on speculation and FOMO instead of fundamentals. Hm...**

After getting out of TSLA, I drank a beer, did some DD, and switched over to $F. Do your own DD, this post is too long. Also I’m a big PLTR bull. 

Anyway, that’s it. Fuck off. 

**Tl;dr Ark funds are likely victims of their own success. Tilt, mean regression, and a bad and disloyal investor base will bring them back to fair value in the 1-5 year term and beyond.

It opens the game up to the “retail” swarms that mobilized around GME on Reddit. They targeted the huge exposed short positions in GameStop (well over 100% of the company’s outstanding float).

3/6/21 21:02,"The TSLA bubble has finally popped Good morning fellow Daddy Musk fans, it's time we talk about what's  happening with TSLA and why it's happening.

As many of you are by now  aware TSLA has been in free fall for the past month blasting through  multiple ""support levels"" and leaving a **trail of loss porn** behind. Now you may be wondering why your OTM weekly calls are  going to zero week after week and I'm here to tell you it's not going to  get better.

Let's take a journey aboard the modern day EV Titanic known as TSLA.

**Disclaimer: This is fan fiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place, not financial advice.**

Before you blast my ass how TSLA shorts have been fucked every single time during the past years I'll explain to you why **this time it's different**. I'll start with a late 2019 quote from our autistic uncle Dr. Michael Burry.

*""Passive investing has removed price discovery from the equity markets.""*

What  does this mean? Well, the quote applies to the overall market but in  the case of TSLA it means actively managed mutual funds with TSLA long  positions have been replaced by passive index funds and ETFs. Passive  funds have overtaken active mutual funds market share in the past 2  years. How the fuck does this relate to price discovery? It means for  the past 2 years retards and degenerates like us have been piling money  onto ETFs like Mommy Cathie's ARKK without actually doing any DD on what  turds the ETF is actually holding. I know, the gains have been  impressive with CNBC and Bloomberg praising Cathie's ETFs to the fucking  moon. Fair enough, however let's take our lips off **Cathie's tits** for a second and look at what ARKK is actually holding.

Here's the punch line (taken from a random tweet yesterday):

**Top  10 ARKK companies have a combined market cap of $1200B with revenues of $76B and  earnings of $2.5B. If it was a single company it would be trading at  480x earnings, 16x sales with a profit margin of 3,3%.**

Let that shit sink in before we move on.

Now back to the situation at hand. ARKK is down 25% in the past month and so are the other **simp funds** trying to ride **Mommy Cathie's ass**  to the moon. Outflows from the ETF have accelerated in the recent  month, which will cause Cathie to sell off her overvalued babies and dump  them onto the street with TSLA being the biggest and most overvalued  stock she's holding with a weight of 9,99% of ARKK. The outflows may  cause overall liquidity issues for her fund, [/u/seldomsage](https://www.reddit.com/u/seldomsage/) wrote a great post about this shit on [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) . Go read that shit to understand what's about to happen.

Let's leave the **certified GILF** alone and jump into a hot tub time machine back to December 2020. Our **gay uncle Burry**  came out of the closet early December last year and stated he's  shorting TSLA. Why? Well he recognized active players on TSLA had gotten  out and short interest was extremely low (limiting any short squeeze  risks, I believe it was around 5% of float). I believe after reading the  🌈🐻 erotica uncle Burry has been tweeting for the past months, the **cocaine nosed HF suits**  on Wall Street started to pile onto his TSLA short. You can clearly see  this in TSLA options chain, the put/call ratio and spiking short  volume. It seems right now everyone and their retarded cousin is  shorting TSLA. This will lead to a cycle where TSLA goes down, ETFs  holding TSLA will go down, outflows from ETFs will continue and TSLA  will go down even more. Thus, there's a chance TSLA will drag down the  overall market with it.

In addition here's a list of smooth brained arguments why I think TSLA is still going down.

1. The **P/E is still 938**. No fund manager with an IQ above 80 will touch this stock at these prices.
2. The stock is at **$597 a piece**. Most of us work at Wendy's and don't have the cash to buy a single share.
3. Call options are **expensive as fuck**, again, Wendy's.
4. TSLA stopped taking orders for entry level Model Y. Together Model 3 and Model Y account for **90% of TSLA sales**.
5. **Lithium shortage**, probably related to point 4.
6. Ford and Volkswagen. Particularly **Ford Mustang Mach-E**, which started eating away TSLA market share.
7. The  jig is up. Selling flamethrowers and tweeting memes wont make TSLA  profitable any time soon, eventually the market will go back to the  fundamentals and realize that TSLA is actually just a car company with **low profit margins**.

Lastly I'm not saying TSLA is a bad company or that the products are bad. In fact I think they're making **great products**, the company is just **BIGLY** overvalued at this point.

If we're constantly ignoring valuations, continuing to buy into companies that are significantly overvalued,  why can't we just keep doing that forever? I'm only half joking. If Tesla was overvalued at $500 for example, it was still overvalued all the way up to $800 and yet we kept buying. Why does valuation matter? No one but large institutions actually gets anything out of owning any stock (with the exception being dividend stocks). Like ok, yeah, you get a ""piece of ownership"". Good luck trying to get Google to stop stealing personal information with your 0.00000001% stake, or getting ExxonMobil to stop spilling oil into our oceans. We just assign this shit value.

Last year, Apple had a hell of a run. After dipping as low as $53 per share, we saw an amazing growth of nearly 300% when it hit an all-time high of $145.09 in January. Like Tesla, anybody who would have gotten in on Apple this time last year would finally be moving out of their wife's house to give her and her boyfriend some privacy.

3/10/21 02:14,"Ride the NIO to the moon up more than 10% already HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers Li Auto Inc LI.O, Nio Inc NIO.N and Xpeng Inc XPEV.N plan to list in Hong Kong as soon as this year, tapping a growing investor base closer to home, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The trio each aim to sell at least 5% of enlarged share capital in the Asian hub, the people said. Based on their New York market capitalisation on Monday, proceeds could reach $5 billion.

The companies have been working with advisors on the sales which could begin as early as mid-year, said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.

Li Auto, Nio and Xpeng - which have raised $14.7 billion in U.S. markets since 2018 - declined to comment. U.S.-listed shares of the three automakers rose between 3.7% and 5.3% in early deals.

The plans come as the trio increase capital raising efforts to fund technology development and expand sales networks, to better compete in the world's biggest EV market where U.S. peer Tesla Inc TSLA.O is boosting sales of its China-made vehicles.

This year is set to be crucial for EV makers to seize market share as the industry expects China sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) to jump almost 40% from last year to 1.8 million units.

""Despite much richer financial resources now compared with a year ago, EV start-ups still need to invest heavily in next-generation technology,"" said analyst Shi Ji at Haitong International. ""Exploring a secondary listing much closer to their home market, if any, is a good move.""

Selling shares in Hong Kong would also add the trio to a slew of New York-listed Chinese firms seeking a presence on more local exchanges amid Sino-U.S. political tension.

The rising number of such listings ""has enhanced the status of Hong Kong's capital markets globally, and also helped issuers reach higher valuations and raise more capital,"" said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset.



TRACK RECORD

Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.

Li Auto and Xpeng went public in the United States mid-last year so will likely apply in Hong Kong for a dual primary listing, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter.

As per Hong Kong's dual primary listing rules, firms are subject to full bourse requirements in Hong Kong and a second exchange, but are not bound by the two-year condition.

Xpeng is also considering a third listing on Shanghai's STAR Market for new-economy firms, said two other people.

""In the long run, it's helpful for consumer-focused companies like us to connect with domestic capital markets and domestic investors,"" Xpeng President Brian Gu told Reuters last week, declining to comment on any Hong Kong listing plan.

""This is the direction we should pay attention to.""



GOING GREEN

China's government has heavily promoted NEVs - such as battery-powered, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars - in response to chronic air pollution, spurring interest from technology companies and investors alike.

Last month, Reuters reported telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL plans to market EVs as early as this year. nL1N2KW0HV

China forecasts NEVs will make up 20% of its annual auto sales by 2025 from around 5% in 2020.

Domestic vehicle deliveries last year totalled 32,624 by Li Auto, 43,728 by Nio and 27,041 by Xpeng. That compared with 147,445 vehicles by Tesla, industry data showed.

3/9/21 09:24,"Why $NIO is a good buy This is my first DD, feel free to go in raw and no rubber, nuts to butts with your criticism

1. Backed by the CCP

“Generally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.” - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))

The CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.

&#x200B;

2. Reasons for recent price movements

There are two causes for the recent price movements. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:

* Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3
* Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3
* Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3
* Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3

While the earnings report may not have completely met analysts’ expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.

The second potential cause of $NIO’s decline is that it’s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))

&#x200B;

3. Market Cap compared to competitors

$NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly.

&#x200B;

4. Potential for future growth

Although $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO’s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn’t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.

$NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j

&#x200B;

5. The actual products

In order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can’t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for 30 minutes without a supercharger, or one hour without one before being able to drive 44 miles (source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla’s, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive.

&#x200B;

With the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.

**TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.

Ok retards. So I was one of the apes who bought GME during the first squeeze, and instead of holding or selling at the top, I sold and lost my life changing gains by selling at the absolute bottom of almost $40. So naturally this didn’t bode well with me, but I have a really really good idea.

So I have decided here and now that I will take out the biggest, juiciest, fattest loan and I’m gonna YOLO all of it on GME. Now I know what you’re thinking, I’m completely retarded, and you’re right, I definitely have a few extra chromosomes than the majority of you apes. But this plan is foolproof, I have no debt, I have good credit, and I simply don’t give a fuck because this literally can’t go tits up. 

I’ll either retire early or “retire early” if u catch my drift so it’s a win win either way. I’ll update you guys as soon as I can find the meatiest loan to yolo into GME and I’ll see you guys in my million dollar mansion and Tesla in a few weeks. Also if GME breaks 700 I’ll go into GameStop and buy every PS5 in stock and give away every single one of them.

TLDR: YOLO money I don’t own to become a multi millionaire 🚀 🚀🚀🚀

3/11/21 08:15,"Iqiyi ($IQ) - the Netflix of China - poised to soar - TSLA all over again **TL;DR**

IQ is undervalued and technically promising. It has a cocktail of factors similar to TSLA 4 months ago before the 1000% rise. If it breaks out of its current trading range, it can soar very high.

**Fundamentals**

iQIYI is currently the #1 video streaming site in China. Truly the 'Netflix of China', it has more users than any other platform. Competition is intense - Tencent and Alibaba have competitor platforms - but iqiyi is still number 1, and that gives them the opportunity to grow their lead.

IQ is a growth stock, currently being valued as if it isn't. It's heavily in debt - as you'd hope all growth stocks would be - and it continues to invest in producing original content, at the expense of more tangible assets. They don't seem to care about profit, and have very rough financials. This is typical for growth stocks with a high valuation - the valuation is usually based on speculation about the future. However, IQ has a low valuation. Speculation about the future is *not priced in*. Its market cap is just $22b. It is currently being viewed like a struggling company - which it isn't. This means it is highly susceptible to a huge change in valuation, just by viewing it as a growth stock and pricing in the value of the huge array of exclusive content, and more users than any other platform. This current valuation is insane.

IQ is also being shorted, based on some very, very, uninformed claims ('[faking their numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/iqiyi-accused-of-fraud-by-wolfpack-muddy-waters.html)' - a company surveyed people in China and basically didn't find as many using Iqiyi as their numbers would suggest. A completely unreliable unscientific study that used a tiny sample size (1500) and drew sweeping conclusions, aided by a single ex-employee, and some unspecified *'data'*, this is garbage, probably produced for self-promotion purposes among the Sinophobic investment crowd. This study launched an SEC investigation, which heavily suppressed the stock price, but the whole thing is simply ridiculous). Regardless, shorts get squeezed when the price goes up, whether they're right or wrong.

**TECHNICALS**

*IQ has been in a trading range for 2 years

*It has just closed at the very top of that range.

*Momentum has been VERY strong approaching this level - rising almost every day, even when related stocks/indicies fell.

If it breaks out of the range, it will soar - due to: 

1. The technicals (the end of the trading range leading to a breakout)
2. The short squeeze
3. That price rise causing reevaluation as a growth stock and pricing in the intangible assets.
4. Then, renewed interest and maybe even the hype it deserves.

**SUMMARY**

This is a growth stock being wrongfully viewed as a struggling company, beset by shorts and in a trading range for 2 years. This is *essentially the exact same scenario that Tesla ($TSLA) was in 4 months ago*, before its 1000% rise. If it breaks out, it can go very high.

If it doesn't break out, it will likely go down to the $15-$17 area at the bottom of the range. Trading ranges do continue more than they change, but it's hard to see that happening now.",40755,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.993109465,True
3/11/21 15:53,"GE might be doing a 1:8 reverse stock split Here’s an article about it:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-ge-is-doing-a-reverse-stock-split-and-what-it-means-for-you-11615391261

And here’s my take on it:

There is no innate reason why a stock split or reverse split would change the held value of a stock, it just changes share price and the amount of shares held/floated. That being said, last year we saw some big movement when popular companies (like TSLA for instance) did stock splits to reduce their share price. This had the effect of making these stocks more available to retail investors like us, which ended up causing prices to surge.

Now, could a reverse stock split work similarly? Well, no, because it’s putting shares further out of reach of the average retail investor. That being said, current share price of GE is around $14 so the new price would be around $112, which certainly isn’t ludicrously expensive. The thing that I’m most attracted to is the fact that this would have the effect of immediately cutting float by 87.5%.

Think about what’s happened with GME (similar ticker lulz). Basically we fucked the shorts by eating up all the float. When there’s not much float available, prices go up, and shorts get fucked and end up driving the price up further when they close out their positions. What I’m saying is if investors start buying up GE heavily up to the reverse split and/or even shortly after it, the float is going to get very limited, which could have the effect of pushing the price very high (supply and demand).

Anyway, I just like the stock. I’ve been playing it long for quite a while now and it’s been climbing very steadily over the past few months (new CEO seems to know his shit).

# The Teslabro Fears the CanooTruck

I never imagined that I would spend so much time shilling for something that looks like it was designed in a Sanfransiscan Bath House but [today's leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/) of Canoo Truck really pushed me into the zone of CanooBro fanboy.  This Lesbian Mystery Machine is so financially compelling that I am straight ""Jacked to the Tits"", as /u/effinwookie puts it, in GOEV calls.

**My current positions.**

1. 46 4/16 15$c - Original Sane Position
2. 20 3/19 17.5$c - Straight Gambling
3. 40 4/16 30$c - Retarded Yolo Gambling  Inspired by CavemanTurboChad /u/knyggaplease

I might be Blue collar fancy on the dab but I'm not as ""Jacked"" to the **Moontits** as the rest of the fucking market. There is a total of [98,725](https://u.teknik.io/nbcFT.PNG) open interest for March 19th Calls.... 9.8 Million Shares most of them out of the money.  Think about that...

I didn't even look at the puts... ^((Ok TBH after writing that  I just looked at the puts because I don't want to be wrong) )

Lets talk about today's trading and what Ortex tells us about short interest. Today we saw a gap opening which settled down into slow bullish trajectory that dipped into close. As I write this at 1900 3/10 I am going to predict that short interest grew as today (ortex lags a day in estimating short interest) trading was characterized by a price capping style where there always seemed to be a few hundred shares that appear out of no where.  This is encouraging and discouraging at the same time.

**Future Self finds** \-  Ortex [money shot](https://u.teknik.io/BvM6k.png)\- 3/11/201 - **Oh this is good!**

* **DTC Increased to 1.46**
* **Estimated SI Increased to 10.1 Mil!**
* **Utilization is 100**

edit - 3  (SI increasing with Price is confirmatory of my thesis there was significant price capping yesterday but they were unable to actually bring the price down.  The DTC increase is the most significant and we are looking like we are going to a gap open this morning)

I am highly encouraged that some shorts have covered yet others (or the same one) have/has opened new positions at a lower share price. Average age of shorting has increased over the past few days but this could just be that the new short positions ""weigh"" less than the older ones.  This digging in of the heels shows the power of the gamma ramp magnetism.

[GoevWhale Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoevWhale) found this Dark pool Order by [Dark Pool Melstone](https://twitter.com/MelStone31/status/1369353690566524934?s=20)

(Dark pools allow massive transactions of shares to occur without affecting the share price)

I consulted the **Godfather (AKA Cartesian Ghost AKA Hal Squarerootofnegative1)** about the fact that 2 Days ago someone purchased 5000 4/16 25$p  which this dark pool order perfectly matches. Someone is probably taking up a synthetic short position to hedge their bets against the share price increasing.  As the share price goes psycho the IV spikes so do the prices of Puts.     This is big time shit.. Retail is just along for the ride.   The Godfather advises that this is to essentially retain the freedom to maneuver and stay net neutral to ride the SP.  This is a bet that the SP will skyrocket in March and dip in April and then Continue to move up... Or April gave them the best vantage point to play the field... its probably /u/deepfuckingvalue

What is encouraging is that the pattern over the last few days has been gap openings met with  price capping and bullish long pressure to stabilize and push it.  (I actually think that monday we saw a recent short cover as we ran around the mountain and AVG age of shorts increased) We can see from the above chart what gap openings do to the price.  (A: MM have to buy more shares.)  Check the last few days we have seen an immediate spike in price on open with it settling down and then slowly rising as a long continues to push shorts, its actually straight warfare if you watch the L2 (and of course normal profit taking, day trading or retail or whatever its not all about short squeezing is it now).

**This makes me believe that Shorts are opening new positions lower but aren't willing to go hard in the paint...**  They are essentially just digging their heels in as they are being slowly shoved towards a cliff..

SI increasing slightly with SP increasing is confirmatory of this thesis.  I'll update in the morning

**Listen, What I am saying is that Someone or some people with 9 milly in Short Interest spent the last few months beating your stock like a rented mule and then went and spent that margin somewhere else thinking $GOEV was SPAC trash.

(**I can't confirm this directly but reports from the front state the article originally just said truck leak yadda yadda cool story bro.)**  Then they went to go talk to the Chairman (Who cares about the CEO these days) who didn't answer them until the market closed and said, yeah **GigaChad Tesla Killer** will be made in a microfactory...

3/12/21 02:11,"Tesla vs. Apple Company Trends DD Disclaimer:  Before I say anything, please know: I am very retarded. I do not own  any Tesla shares; I merely own a Tesla and am a tech enthusiast. These  are **my own observations and my own opinions**, not taken from any sources or market trends. Another thing: this is **not** a stock DD, merely a company one, but it does have implications for the stock.

Recently,  I've been thinking a lot about Tesla and Apple and couldn't help but  notice just how similar the trends in their practices are. Let's take a  closer look at what exactly they do similarly.

**Broadly  speaking, while many other companies base decisions off of current  consumer wants, Tesla & Apple dictate their decisions based on their  own vision of simplicity**. This generally means that the  decisions they make are more geared towards their vision without too  much regard for the consumer. On Apple's side:

1. They  took away the headphone jack from their iPhones in 2016. Sure, there  were valid reasons (saving space on the inside), but this pissed a lot  of people off. In the end, we saw that this decision was a way to  promote their Airpods and further their version of a minimalist future.  And guess what? Not long after, all other companies took away the  headphone jack too.
2. They  removed the charger from the box of the iPhones in 2020. Once again, an  anti-consumer decision. Whether or not this decision ""saves the  environment"" or not isn't something I want to debate, but we just know  this further contributes to their minimalist vision. Again, Samsung and  Xiaomi followed and took away the charger from their box as well.
3. They  took away the standard USB ports from their 2016 and later Macbooks,  opting for USB C. Who the hell used USB C in 2016? Nonetheless, this  decision made the computer more minimalistic and simple; in fact, five  years after that transition, USB C seems to be the way to go for most  laptops nowadays.

Like  Apple, Tesla has made a number of decisions that are controversial, and  their new 2021 Model S lineup seems to further support this idea:

1. The  2016/17 Tesla refreshes dramatically simplified their vehicles in the  name of simplicity. For one, the Model 3 had automatic windshields,  headlights, and even braking (you very rarely have to press on the  brakes ever since regenerative braking automatically stopped the car  fully). These were not that controversial, but the windshield one seemed  odd. To control the windshields manually, one had to enter the Tesla  menu and change it there rather than having a windshield stock like all  cars did at the time.
2. The  2021 Tesla Model S refresh made a number of ""anti-consumer"" decisions  much like those of Apple. For one, the yoke steering wheel seems to  serve NO practical purpose other than put drivers at risk. It is rumored  that there will be no D/N/R gear stock, meaning the car AUTOMATICALLY  decides which gear you should be driving in based on your surroundings  (ex: if you're in a parking spot and there's something in front of you,  it will automatically put the car in reverse). Like, who asked for this? This is the MOST Apple-esque thing that Tesla has ever planned to do. 

Another  aspect of simplicity is the release timeline and refresh of models. To  accurately illustrate this point I'll compare them with other companies.  Let's start with Apple:

\- Releases only a few new phone models per year. In the past, there was just **one iPhone per year**.  This year there was the iPhone 12 mini, 12, 12 pro, and 12 pro max. It  sounds like a lot, but compared to Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi (the  three biggest Android phone makers) it's nothing. Of course, they have  their main S20/S20+/S20 Ultra/Note 20/Note 20 Ultra, but Samsung also  has their S20 FE, M41, A51, A71, A71 5G, A51 5G, and the list just goes  on and on. Yes, there are even considerable differences in the 5G  versions of each phone, such as having different chipsets and thus  different performance. You can look at the smartphones for Huawei and Xiaomi and the lists are equally long.

\-  When Apple makes decisions, they stick with them for a long time. The  home button iPhone models with the <4 inch screens (2007 iPhone —>  2013 iPhone 5) had very similar designs. What's more, the 2014 iPhone 6  —> 2017 iPhone 8 had **indistinguishable**  designs. They had identical screen sizes, resolutions, and the  exteriors looked exactly the same. The same applies for the notch at the  top of the screen. Since the 2017 iPhone X the notch design has barely  changed even after four release cycles (X, XS, 11, 12). For comparison,  take a look at Samsung's main S lineup: S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21. **Every single year the phone looks considerably different**. This is not a good or bad thing, but just an observation.

Ok  this post is getting super long but bear with me here. Tesla is no  different from Apple in these release cycles and to show that I'll  compare it to some companies.

\- **Tesla only has five models** (one unreleased): **S, 3, X, Y, Roadster** (tehcnically). The models are **only refreshed every four years or so**.  In 2016, the Model S was refreshed for the first time since 2012,  getting a slightly sleeker design and some interior changes. Again, this  Model S held until 2021, where the model is undergoing changes for the  first time in five years. Let's look at how many models **Toyota**,  one of the biggest car brands in the world has: Corolla, Yaris, Prius,  Avalon, Camry, RAV4, RAV4 EV, C-HR, Land Cruiser, Supra, 86, Mirai,  Tacoma, and the list goes on forever.  Each of these models goes through a refresh cycle quicker than every  four years like Tesla, and a lot of stuff is changed (not just a minor  front cosmetic refresh like the Tesla Model S).

What does this all mean for the consumer? It means two things, good and bad:

1. **They have less choices to make.**  The consumer's buying decision is much easier. If they want an iPhone,  they only have so many choices. If they want a Tesla Sedan, there aren't  20 different choices like one would face buying a Toyota.
2. **On the flip side, the consumer is subject to the choices, good and bad, of the company**.  Whenever Apple or Tesla make a bad decision, the consumer has to go  along with that decision if they want to stay with the company. When  Apple switched their **entire laptop lineup** to USB C, or when they removed the headphone jack from **all of their phones**,  consumers had to deal with that if they wanted an iPhone. If that  individual instead had a Samsung phone, they have a ton of other phones  to choose from, many of which retain the headphone jack (of course, a  buying decision is more complicated than whether or not there's a  headphone jack. this is just an example).

Lastly, ***what does this mean for Tesla's future?***

Here is one potential way this all could play out based on Apple's position in the market:

1. In  the next five years, Tesla will be all the talk the same way the iPhone  was everything in the first few years of its launch. No other company  had done what Apple had done with the phone then, so they played catchup  in this period.
2. By **2025–2030**,  a number of companies will have exceeded Tesla's EV in different ways.  Some might have much better performance (faster 0–60s, higher HP, etc.)  for better prices, or longer range. The analogy of this is in 2014 and  2015 when Android phones began to cost less than iPhone with better  specs.
3. In  10+ years when the EV market matures, Tesla will still be a market  leader but likely in the same way that Apple is a ""market leader"". While  not being majority percentage of the automobile market Tesla will still  be one of the biggest players (the same way Apple currently holds 9%  market share in computers with macOS and 27% of the global phone  market).

Once again, I'm  a retard. There will be things you disagree with and maybe things that  are out-right incorrect, but I hope you took away something based on the  general premise of the post.

tl;dr: Main reasons for why Apple and Tesla are similar:

1. Apple  and Tesla make decisions to advance their ultimate vision of  simplicity, not thinking about the consumer first (Apple removing iPhone  headphone jack in 2016, removing iPhone charger in 2020, Tesla's yoke  steering wheel 2021 + automatic gear shifting)
2. Similar  to 1, but their lineup advances this vision of simplicity to make the  consumer's decision easier (Only a few new iPhones each year compared to  other phone companies, Tesla only has four current car models)

Prediction  of Tesla's future: While for the first few years they will be the  dominating EV maker, companies will start to catch up in 2025–2030 and  have ""headline features"" (ex: longer range, better performance, more  software quirks). After 10 ish years of EV market maturing, competition  will continue to be fierce and push the boundaries of innovation but  Tesla will still have a considerable stake in the market (between 10%  and 30%).",41083,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998915911,True

I still have 20 more calls (also shown below) that I'll try to press to a $60 strike before closing/rolling that position.

My basic premise is that while most are viewing GM's rise as an EV play, the share gains are actually because of Boomer metrics.  GM is producing too much cash and growing earnings too much to have a dying industrial PE multiple.  They're sandbagging earnings and have a history of such.  When they beat earnings again next quarter, GM will moon, again.  You don't have to view GM as a Tesla rival to have tendies print now because of large SUV's.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

FSLR got caught up with short selling around the same time as GME so it is looking like some tasty dip right now, let me tell you why.

THESE FUCKING GENIUSES DON'T USE SILICON

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR. SPWR uses silicon, I can't find explicit text about TSLA/Panasonic material but it does look like a clusterfuck of a deal that's falling apart. 

FSLR is the largest. Since 2015. AND THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Solar panels are about to be even more in demand than GPUs are now. Only one domestic company can fill trucks with them this year. 

MSM were churning out articles convincing people to sell this stock while they were actively shorting it. Not one fucking article mentions THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

3/16/21 23:07,"I am going to short the whole state of California I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts California is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current NON-GOVERNATOR government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of Hollywood California. Due to systemic nepotism, there are Stanford teachers that don't know what IP-addresses are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never not fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The NON-GOVERNATOR Government solved this, against advise of Mel Gibson, with constant remakes. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the Hollywood Buck which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates of Silicon Valley (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison watch dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as TSLA stock and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated opinions comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). Californians are more likely to have their privilege checked than any other state as there are so many tales of Political Correctness and shaming and threats of getting cancelled. This equates to the most based citizens leaving CA and most CA based businesses diversifying out of the state as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Californian in history Steve Jobs who is now a dead American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock. 
I first thought about shorting California over a year ago when I was researching ~~hot Hollywood actors~~ the state.  (I'm a diamond hand, I read much on the state for fun). I found the only index tracking CA (ECA) wasn't an accurate representation of CA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of CA (mostly to other parts of America). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on CA going full Paper Hands/Detroit. Detroit having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.
My new broker, Harambe's Diamond Hands, allows negative currency positions as long you post your kids as collateral. Now my native currency are HarambeCoin, where inflation in 2020 was fekkin' high while the Hollywood Buck was fekkin' higher in 2020. That equals a super-fekkin' high return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting HarambeCoin inflation to stay between fekkin' low to fekkin' lower every year while the Hollywood Buck (ticker HOBO) stays north of 69% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for CA to implode.

3/21/21 11:20,"$FSR is worth $58 a share I have put my life savings of $158,000 on Fisker (previous thread for proof) and I am going to explain why. Read before you shitpost.

Book value: company has $1b in cash and no debts. Its fair value is $5/share. It cannot go lower than this unless the company were to burn all the cash and create no marketable product.

Forward looking: Production is not for another year. The stock market is as psychological as fundamental. DeepFuckingValue primarily invested in GameStop before the new console was released because he knew investors would become excited towards the release date. It's a similar concept here. As production nears, investor sentiment will only increase.

Bears will say the EV bubble has already materialized for FSR. It hasn't. Here's why: TSLA trades 6.5x projected 2025 revenues, NIO about 3.25x. **FSR is currently trading <.5x projected 2025 revenues.**

So what is a ""fair"" multiple for FSR? I do not think Tesla or even Fisker's multiple is fair at all. Tesla has Elon Musk as a CEO's premium that Fisker will never reach because its CEO is known as a failed automotive CEO that has already bankrupted a company. It is also a battery company, along with NIO, something Fisker is not. That is outsourced to Magna. So those multipliers are unlikely. But a 1.25 multiplier is very reasonable. That is a $58 price target and 16b valuation.

Management cares. Fisker has already bankrupted a company before and he will certainly not want to again, pretty much it's all or nothing here. His life is on the line right now. He, his wife, the CFO, and others have shown this by all taking minimum wage job salary cuts in order to maximize shareholder value. The company has also utilized cashless warrants to minimize dilution (and shows they are confident in their cash balance to reach production)

Obvious risks: partner Magna cancels the company is probably cut in half valuation, reservations could miss, funding could miss, things get delayed.

It's worth a bet. I trust Fisker to make it right here. And if he is right, investors will be very well compensated. Thank you. You may shitpost below.",42071,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.9930408,True
3/17/21 11:25,"RKT vs UWMC This isn’t advice, I’m just rambling.

So I listened to you monkes and bought RKT.
Then I listened again and bought some UWMC.

Now UWMC is sitting low right now, and expectations are plain that it’ll recover with magnificent green for anyone HODLing like a good boy. And UWMC is coming out of the RKT little trade dispute claiming victory. And their graph looks promising, since the expectation is it’ll go back up, then keep growing because why wouldn’t it? Unless their ultimatum doesn’t pan out how they hoped it would?

But RKT isn’t just going to go out of business. Their stock price is lowish, and maybe they lost some market share to UWMC after that ultimatum. But odds are they’ll recover; or at least won’t go broke immediately. They don’t announce their next earnings until May, so we won’t know for sure how this pans out for a little while. But here’s the thing. As of a week ago, with the previous earnings report, RKT has an EPS higher than the price. That gives it a P/E of <1 as of writing. And that means it *should* go up.

Look at any other stock. Their P/E, specifically. You’ll see 10, 20, 50. Bought TSLA? That’s 1000x P/E. That means that the stock price is that many *times* higher than that percentage of the company is profitable. Higher P/E values are irrational, and represent investors expecting the company to grow to meet that number. Except for insane stocks like TSLA, because growing that much is impossible. But big numbers are fun, and TSLA attracts the nuts, so fine. TSLA is a rollercoaster. Just, perhaps, a rickety one.

Now look at UWMC. Their P/E is 0, because their EPS is negative. They are losing money, they are unprofitable. This is not a good thing for a company to be. Without outside assistance or major internal change, they’ll run out of money eventually and go out of business. Unless they’re a growth stock in a new company, in which case those negative earnings represent the “start up time”; getting the ball rolling costs; once it gets going, it pays off. And guess what, UWMC *is* growing, so hey there might be something to that.

But RKT? They are objectively undervalued. And while the stock market is generally understood to be irrational, it will, occasionally, pass through the rational values to get to other irrational values. Moreover, it’s generally irrational *up*, not *down*.

Point is, UWMC should go up because it’s a growing company, and may *hopefully soon* become profitable.

Meanwhile, RKT should also go up, because it is *actually* profitable *and* undervalued right now.

So *why not both*?

3/18/21 10:45,"Who will win Autonomous Driving? Waymo Vs Tesla After watching a video featuring Teslas ""Full self driving"" video Vs a Waymo video I have realized Waymo is far ahead of Tesla. Comparing the dashboard display of what the car is seeing, Waymo's software is far more advanced, less erratic and to me seems evident that Elon will indeed need a Lidar/Camera sensor like Microvisions which will be released in April . IMO Teslas software doesn't seem to read the velocities of other cars and pedestrians well. The rep seems to think the Tesla isn't programed to see potholes. Which we have seen from the MVIS Lidar video to be a key point. In the video the Tesla has a hard time reading curbs, pillions and a fence/ wall and by now im sure we've heard of at least one Tesla crash. This leads me to believe that Autonomous driving will be regulated and Elon could eventually be forced to use Lidar as Lidar could eventually become a mandatory sensor in all new cars, especially Autonomous. .

(Youtube video links are not allowed here but you can look up Waymo's self driving videos vs FSD beta 8.2 in Oakland )

Tesla's ""Full self driving"" at times acts drunk and requires the driver to continually disengage the auto driving feature. While in Waymo's case passengers are sitting in the rear seat separated by Plexiglas and there is no one to take grab the wheel and over, to me that means Waymo is more advanced and confident in their tech.

This in my opinion Is great news for MicroVision $MVIS investors considering their ""Best in class Lidar"" is coming out in April and is going to be a two in one Camera and Lidar Combo under $1000

This is great news for MicroVision for the following reasons (not in chronological order):

""Waymo began as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009.""

Sevals Oz the recently appointed MVIS director held a previous position for google\[X\] was ""Self driving cars- HEAD of global PARTNERSHIPS and BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT""

$Ford and $GOOGL ""come together in first-of-its-kind partnership to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to accelerate Ford’s transformation plan""

Ford pledges $29 billion for Evs and Autonomous Vehicles

Ford backs out of $VLDR ( alsoVLDRs CEO backs down saying the company has fostered a anti share holder culture.)

Former Ford executive of 32 years, Judy Curran is added to the Microvision BOD.

Microvision's CEO has continually stress the fact that he wants to maximize share holders value and has stated he wants to burn the shorts.

Look at Waymo's website, while they maybe ahead on the software side but I'm sure they are dying to to remove ALL of those big bulky sensors and increase aerodynamics and decrease drag coefficients . Thats why Microvision is so important to them. I'm sure Waymo and google are eager to release a car to the public especially after seeing teslas falsely advertised ""Full Self Driving""

Waymo Via has been learning to self drive class 8 trucks for 4 years now.

When clarifying the A Sample in Microvisions ER CEO Sharma mentions Long haul trucking for the first time in the following quotes:

""Our solid-state, long-range LiDAR sensor could enable any interested party to perform testing with our sensor on their moving platforms, such as cars and longhaul trucks""

..""No, that's A sample. That's where it's up for sale. So as I said, potentially, if somebody wants to work the hardware on a moving platform test because obviously, we're not investing in moving platform testing on cars or long-haul trucking""

Could they already be working with Google? Lets not forget Microvisions Board of Directors and their Google/ Ford ties..

A look at Microvisions Board:

CEO: Summit Sharma : Former Head of operations for Google glass

Seval Oz: Former Google Self driving cars- head of global PARTNERSHIPS and BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

Mark Spitzer: Former Operations Director at Google

Judy Curran: 32 years at Ford, in Director and head engineer roles. Current Head of automotive strategy at ANSYS

Microvision is up for sale, and to me it appears google is making moves..  I don't see anyone from Microsoft there (Even though Microvision is inside the Halolens 2) .. I could imagine the bidding war is In full swing as both of the Tech giants seem to have planted their roots in MicroVision. We all know about the Value the Near eye display brings to MSFT. At this point Im starting to believe MVIS will be acquired by Google due to the value MVIS could bring to their Autonomous Vehicle sensors, Heads up displays, Augmented and Mixed reality, and interactive projections


EDIT: For everyone saying camera vision is all you need and LIDAR is doomed. Check out what the simple application of what LIDAR did to the camera in the new iPhones and iPads, all the new features and laser fast focus, the accuracy and precision, the extra data and speed of it, which allows the computer to use less battery and processing power. I’m not saying camera vision is wrong, I’m saying they need LIDAR to pair with it, LIKE THE MICROVISION LIDAR AND CAMERA UNIT. They need the same data source of data with zero latency between them to bring any self driving car to scale. Im not saying radar can’t be used in conjunction but LIDAR lasers and the speed of light is faster than radio waves as their waves are longer and use less frequencies and make radar irrelevant and more of a redundancy. LIDAR can use more frequent programmable pulses and use time of flight senors to read velocity and create a point cloud of 33 Million p/s with multiple Fields of view. If autonomous driving is regulated and OEMS are required to use LIDAR and a bundle of sensors, Tesla will be in a bad position being so behind in LIDAR. 

Yahoo Finance talked about Microvision and autonomous vehicles this week in their article titled  ""Two Tech Stocks To Watch As Biden Pours Trillions Into The Green Economy"" and I quote ""And [all] these automakers’ ambitious plans aren’t possible without companies like MicroVision (NASDAQ:MVIS). MicroVision is one of the industry’s leaders in LIDAR technology, the tech that helps autonomous vehicles “see” when driving. The technology will be a main driver in the adoption of the next auto-revolution, and MicroVision is already pushing the tech to the next level. In fact, MicroVision is already seeing major success with its own long-range lidar sensors, which could be available within months.

There is at minimum 100,000 ITM options expiring this week, definitely more than that but I wasnt gonna sit down and get more than a rough count.

""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,"" he says.

3/22/21 18:42,"The arbitrage Michael Burry trade on Volkswagen Michael Burry said **“I don’t own a Porsche, but I own the Porsche that owns VW that owns Porsche”**. Your autistic brain is most likely confused right now, what did this retard say? Let me explain.

**Burry is essentially indirectly buying Volkswagen shares at a significant discount. He's doing this by investing into Porsche SE (POAHY) instead of Volkswagen (VWAGY).**

* Porsche SE is the largest stakeholder of Volkswagen, they own 31.4% of the entire company.
* Porsche SE also holds the largest Volkswagen voting rights (ordinary shares) at 53.3% 
* Porsche SE is not the Porsche car brand (known as Porsche AG)
* An investment into Porsche SE (POAHY), is an investment into Volkswagen at a discounted share price. The Volkswagen shares that Porsche SE owns is significantly worth more than Porsche SE’s current market-cap.
* Volkswagen current market-cap is 153 billion, 31% of that is 48 billion. There should also be an extra premium on top of that $48 billion as they hold 53.3% of Volkswagen majority voting rights. Porsche SE current market-cap is only 31.5 billion. 
* Porsche SE also has other investments in Lidar and software companies such as Aurora Labs/AEVA.
* This is a sort of arbitrage opportunity that the market still hasn’t fixed.
* Simply put, Porsche SE has the largest ownership and majority voting rights of Volkswagen.

&#x200B;

Volkswagen recently had their own type of ""battery day"" and showed they're dedicated into investing in a EV future (More than $40 billion). They sold more than 9 million vehicles worldwide last year compared to Tesla's under 500K. Tesla lost double digit EV marketshare in Europe in 2020 and the VW ID3 is closing in on Tesla Model 3 sales. Volkswagen has the large customer base, brand power, assets, factories, and EV tech to dominate Europe in the EV industry soon. 

TLDR: Porsche SE (POAHY) seems to be the best way to invest into Volkswagen's EV future at a major discounted price.

3/22/21 10:21,"$FSR is worth $0 a share This stock will fly again due to hype, but it's a $0 company.  My current thesis is they never actually mass produce a car.

Firstly, their projections are to start production in Q4 2022.  Think about that for a minute.  It'll be late Q1 2023 before they plan to ship a car.  And that's IF everything goes to plan.  By then, GM, VW, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Honda, Toyota, Lucid, and others will have a two year head start on actually delivering EVs.  By then there's no reason for someone to wait 24 months for a car.  People did it for Tesla's because they were the only game in town, but they won't do it for a Fisker.

Second, the CEO is a huge liability.  He already made decisions that ran the exact same type of company into the ground.  This does not bode well for long term success.  Yes, it could be a one off due to failed battery packs, but who approved their use?   Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean.  And where?  At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory.  You remember the one?  [https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump](https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump)  .  This does not show me that he's improved his decision making.

Third, price.  If they can deliver on what they are promising I will be amazed.  A 300 mile range EV with a solar roof, and full vegan interior for $37,000.  I may be wrong, but I just don't see it.  They have no proprietary tech, so will be getting all the internals from other manufacturers, but can somehow undercut their prices?  That's a leap of faith.  Faith that hasn't been earned.

Fourth, volume.  They will need to stand up an entire after sales support network (repair shops, trained repair techs, replacement parts, distribution, etc.) for a brand new car line.  In every country they plan to sell to.  You need huge volume to justify this.  Even Tesla is having problems getting people timely repairs to their cars.  How long will that solar roof last after the first hail storm?  Or the first drive behind a dump truck with unsecured gravel in the back?  Who's going to repair it?  How much will it cost?  How long will it take to get the parts?

Fifth, design.  A small concern, I know but I am thinking that by the time they ship a car their design will be outdated.  I think the car looks great now, but so does everyone else's.  And design tastes will change in the next two years.  Can they afford a design refresh before they even ship a car?

Finally, they have no real differentiator.  There's no reason to buy a Fisker over any other EV that will be out ahead of them.

I see canceled pre-orders, manufacturing troubles, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately a failed endeavor without anything to show for it.  Man, I hope I'm wrong, but the more I thought about it the more it didn't make sense.

Source: [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/)

According to which, the expected share price for TSLA is $3,000 in 2025, and in bull case it would be $4,000.

I calculated (based on $4,000 PT) that it comes down to an average of $2.42 gain per day till January 1st, 2025. Ideally, if the price moved linearly then this is how it would look like (six months intervals).

|Date|Projected Price.|

|July 1, 2021|$906.24|
|January 1, 2022|$1,350.97|

|July 1, 2024|$3,555.27|
|January 1, 2025|$4,000.00|

We know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.

Currently, I only have one TSLA $687.5c 3/26e.

As always, please do your own DD. TSLA is a very volatile stock so be patient and extra careful with your plays.

Edit #1: Sold my TSLA call for 120% profit.

Edit #2: /u/tortoisepump pointed out that it makes more sense to use fixed percentage value (instead of fixed dollar value) for projections. Here is the updated projection after today's price action.

3/22/21 06:05,"TSLA fundamentals analysis - why it's not overvalued ARK’s latest price target for Tesla has been the subject of a lot of discussion lately. They believe it will reach $3000 per share in the next 5 years, which based on its current market price of $654 implies about a 50% annual rate of return. If you haven’t already, you can take a look at the [article](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/) they published explaining how they arrived at this price target and the assumptions they made.

I recently got [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8pntp/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/grq28wo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) for suggesting that this price target wasn’t illogical and that Cathie wasn’t crazy. So I wanted to explain my reasoning a bit more so that more people can downvote me and tell me why I’m wrong.

Now just to be clear, I’m not here to argue about whether EVs are the future, whether existing car companies are unprepared to switch to EV, or whether Tesla is an insurance play. I’m assuming that you’re already interested in investing in Tesla and the only thing stopping you is its valuation.

**P/E. It’s over 1000! But is it a useful metric?**

P/E seems to be the most common argument for why Tesla is overvalued. Why buy Tesla at 1023 P/E when you could buy GM at 14 P/E or even Workhorse at 23 P/E?

Let’s step back a bit. Companies can be categorized into one of three stages: growth, maturity, and decline. P/E is useful for valuing mature companies against their mature competitors, since all other things being equal we’d expect their P/Es to eventually equalize as well. For example, I recently bought Target partly because of its P/E of 22 vs Walmart’s 28 and Costco’s 34 (although one could argue that some/all of these companies are still in their growth stage).

On the other hand, P/E is less useful when looking at companies in the growth and decline phases. You could find companies with P/E below 1, but they may be value traps rather than automatic buys. If they go out of business next year, their stock will be worthless.

P/E is similarly flawed when looking at growth stocks. P/E doesn’t account for whether a company is spending a lot aggressively re-investing in itself, or if a company has small earnings now but a good chance of quickly growing into a much larger market. If you had the chance to buy a loss-making company now at $1B market cap now, knowing that its addressable market will quickly expand to $100B, you’d still make a profit over the long term, even buying at massively “inflated” P/E.

That said, P/E is still useful for measuring risk in a growth stock or upside in a declining stock. If Tesla were to transition from growth to maturity or decline, there’s no doubt its P/E and share price would decline significantly. But risk is part of growth investing; this risk exists with other growth stocks too.

**Forward P/E**

While Tesla’s trailing P/E is 1023, its forward P/E is a high but less eye-popping 119. Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing the stock’s market value by its share price, while forward P/E is calculated by dividing the company’s estimated earnings in the following year by its share price. Forward P/E is a more error-prone and risky metric since nobody knows what a company will earn in the future. But it can still be useful when considering the price of a stock, since the market tends to price in expected future performance.

Comparing to some other popular growth stocks, Tesla’s forward P/E is still high but not unreasonable. PINS has 58, SHOP has 227, NFLX has 40. And at least it’s positive. Many growth stocks such as NIO, NKLA, lucid, PLTR, and LMND don’t expect to be profitable within the next year.

And while Tesla’s P/E is high it’s difficult to make a direct comparison with these mentioned companies since they’re not profitable companies in the EV space. There really isn’t another profitable EV company to compare forward P/E with, and that uniqueness/first mover advantage could be partly why Tesla trades at a high forward P/E.

That said, Tesla is still overpriced if (unfairly) comparing against mature auto-makers; GM is at 10 forward P/E, F is at 8. But if you believe those companies have a chance to become EV growth companies and won’t be weighed down by their mature/declining combustion businesses, I’d argue that’s more of a reason to buy them than to sell Tesla.

**Price-to-sales**

If a company is re-investing in itself aggressively, it may be incurring costs that aren’t part of its core business. Once growth slows, it may be able to cut these expenses and dramatically improve its P/E. To account for this, we can look at price to sales.

TSLA’s price-to-sales is 20. For comparison, SHOP is at 47, PLTR is at 40, FVRR is at 42, NIO is at 27, NKLA is chilling at 63619, lucid is at infinity since it doesn’t have sales yet. It’s quite an oversimplification to make these comparisons without considering what portion of a company’s expenses is related to operating costs. SHOP has better margins than TSLA for example, since it’s in a totally different business. But nevertheless, one could argue TSLA is currently undervalued by this metric, even compared to other EV companies.

**A historical example**

Another common argument is that the whole market is overvalued right now, and this is especially the case for growth stocks. I don’t pretend to know what the market will do in the short term, and I’m certainly not discounting the possibility of a further rotation out of growth in the near future. But I know that eventually the market will rotate back into growth stocks. You may have looked like a fool buying Amazon or Microsoft at the height of the dot com bubble, but if you held until now, you’d get the last laugh.

So let’s look at an example from a time when there was less talk about stocks being overvalued. Facebook IPO’d in 2012 at a P/E of 91.2 and price to sales of 24 ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2012/05/17/facebook-is-flat-out-expensive-compared-to-google-at-ipo/?sh=5c83b70c6d03)). Both FB at the time and TSLA now have an annual growth rate of about 45%.

If we take Tesla’s forward P/E, this comparison actually makes Tesla’s price look reasonable, even though Tesla currently trades in a market with record high average P/E.

**Market cap**

One last note - market cap. Yes, Tesla’s market cap is quite high as it’s already one of the most valuable companies in the world. At $654B, if Tesla actually reached $3000 per share it would be the most valuable company in the world (unless other top companies continue to grow as well, which is likely).
The global market for EVs is expected to grow to $800B by 2027, from $162B in 2019. If this is accurate, and you believe Tesla retains its market share and current valuation, without expanding into other areas like ride hailing and insurance, then  the EV market ~5Xing could justify Tesla’s share price ~4.5Xing.

**Tl;dr**

While Tesla is certainly overvalued by trailing P/E, this is a somewhat flawed metric, and by looking at other metrics like forward P/E, price-to-sales, and growth rate, an argument can be made that Tesla is more-or-less fairly valued, and potentially even undervalued. This argument holds even if looking at historical examples from less frothy markets, such as FB after its IPO in 2012.

Like any growth stock, Tesla is a high-risk investment, since its future share price depends on future growth of both the company and the EV space. But the potential for reward is also higher.

3/21/21 08:38,"GME - Possible Tesla Like Short Squeeze? - DD In the comments of [yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/) by u/yodisc I saw some commenters mentioning that this is looking similar to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze, so I did some digging and I'm here to share what I found with everyone today. 
&#x200b;  
#GME Graph and Shorts  
First, let's look at the graph of GME. According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  
&#x200b;  
Now, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#TSLA Graph  
Now, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     
&#x200b;  
Towards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  
&#x200b;  
Tesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#Is This Similar?
Based on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   
&#x200b;  
It is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  
&#x200b;  
#Unknowns
Now, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   
&#x200b;  
I would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  
&#x200b;  
If you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    
&#x200b;     
From this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.      
&#x200b;  
That's all I have for you apes today, thanks for reading, and I feel as though this is required;

**12 Reasons to consider an investment in [Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/):**

**1.** The Endurance will be the first Pickup EV in the WORLD, with 57 beta models set to come out this month


**2.** Targeted for sale to fleet customers (This is unique compared to other EV offerings)


**3.** Marketing agreement with [Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/), one of the largest privately-owned dealership groups in the United States, established in the 1920s (Henry Ford turns in his grave as I type this)


**4.** Lordstown is the only EV company (aside from Tesla) with a huge state of the art production facility (6.2 million square feet)


**5.** Capabilities to produce an Endurance model every 6 minutes by 2022


**6.** Partnership with Camping World and Good Sam, the largest seller of Recreational Vehicles in the World with over 220 locations nationwide.  Also, see [Marcus Lemonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Lemonis)


**7.** Lordstown is currently working on their second vehicle, an Electric Van set to release in 2022 - The earnings call mentions ""Electric World"" set to debut this year. ([Relevant Tweet](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1338707090903347200?s=20) from CEO of Camping World). EDIT: Also, see [Electric World job listings](https://www.google.com/search?q=electric+world+jobs&oq=electric+world+jobs&aqs=chrome..69i57.5831j0j7&client=ms-android-google&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=tlexp&htiq=electric%20world%20jobs&htitab=&htichips=organization_mid:/m/0c8kps&htischips=organization_mid;/m/0c8kps:Camping%20World) at Camping World.


**8.** Dealer approval for direct sales in the State of California, with [pending approval in Ohio](https://www.manufacturing.net/automotive/news/21283873/lordstown-motors-wants-ohio-to-ok-direct-sales)


**9.** Participation in upcoming [Baja Race](https://www.motortrend.com/news/lordstown-endurance-ev-baja-racing-san-felipe-250/)


**10.** On track to begin production in September 2021


**11.** Will use LG chem batteries (Same batteries in Tesla's Model 3 and Y)


**12.** Previous mentions of a battery pack in development for travel trailers that will eliminate the need for standalone generators - ([GREAT reference article](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup))

&#x200B;

You would be blind to not see real potential here, with a target to sell to fleet customers, Lordstown Motors will have many future catalysts, and the best part is that it's an American company.

Now, Imagine how foolish you would feel to ignore the current dip.

The stock price was **$13.30** at market close on 3/19/21 and was just above **$30** on 2/11/21

**My Assessment/Prediction:**

This stock will launch directly to the moon and settle. - The purpose of the current baseless short attack is to push the stock price down so large investment firms can get in while it's low (maximum gains). Then they too will go to the moon with us.

# #RIDEORDIE

**TLDR:** RIDE is going to the moon and bears are actually bulls playing a different angle on their investment.

3/28/21 14:44,"[$BB] The size of real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla's A huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).",43017,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.967925847,True

**Summary:**

\- Most of the article is about VW (maybe sponsored by VW? :-) )

\- VW become the #1 EV maker in EU last year

\----EV cars sales in EU: Dec 2019: TSLA: 110K , VW 46K;  Dec 2020: TSLA: 96K, VW: 174K

\- VW CEO (Diess) using the same strategy as Musk (creating media hype, ""power day"" similar to ""battery day, etc), stock has gone up 80% ytd, meme stock potential

\- This year, VW plans to deliver 1 million plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, and Diess aims to surpass Tesla in EV sales no later than 2025. Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.

\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn’t have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market—and sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).

\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.

\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years

\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)

\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models

\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)

\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from ""legacy"" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves

\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think ""only EV after year xxxx"" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider

&#x200B;

**My Opinion:**

\- good article but would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is where TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with

\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)

*What do you think?*

I thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour.

3/24/21 06:19,"$FROG DD -- The Only Way to Achieve Fully-Autonomous Driving **JFROG** is in a spot that you rarely ever see: a spot where the market doesn't quite understand what they do. You get the chance to capitalize by understanding.

This is my first real DD post, so I would appreciate feedback and criticism here. I think this company is massively overlooked, and here is why:

**What they do:**

Their main product is **JFrog Artifactory**, a universal repository for software binaries (executable code). It also serves as a mirror repository - it stores local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer **JFrog Xray**, which scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities. **JFrog Pipelines** then puts the pieces together, automating the ""building"" of the software. And the last piece is **JFrog Distribution,** which packages up the finished software package and delivers it to its destination (a piece of hardware, like your car, phone, watch, computer).

As a metaphor, let's use a pizza restaurant. Artifactory is the walk-in fridge, Xray is the health inspector, Pipelines is the chef, and Distribution is the delivery driver. They all work together seamlessly so that you can get your pizza.

**How this ties in with the huge Autonomous Driving market:**

JFrog already has partnerships with all of the big players in autonomous driving -- Tesla, Lucid, BMW, Daimler, Toyota Motors, etc. They actually have an Automotive DevOps conference every year ([https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/](https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/)). **JFrog is the sole reason** that you no longer have to turn your car off to apply an update, it's just done automatically over the air.

I'm going to fit the earlier framework into the framework of Autonomous Driving-

* Developers want to improve the function of their vehicles, so they write fresh new code or pull in a new open-source software package
* The fresh code they write, along with the open-source packages is stored in Artifactory
* The code and open-source packages pulled in need to be scanned for vulnerabilities - this is done with JFrog Xray
* The open-source parts and the fresh written parts need to be combined into a program and tested for errors - this is done with JFrog Pipelines
* The code then needs to be delivered over-the-air to the vehicles, seamlessly - this is done with JFrog Distribution

As the autonomous driving industry grows to over 3 trillion by 2025, this specific use case is going to **explode.**

**Other big growth catalysts:**

You may have heard of the Solarwinds and FireEye data hacks/leaks, described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack or ""dependency confusion"". The toolset JFrog offers is the best thing on the market to combat this kind of threat, and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security. **JFrog's Xray tool won the DevSecOps solution of the year award in 2020** ([https://devopsdozen.com/](https://devopsdozen.com/)), beating out all the tools available on the market by a significant margin. Analyst firm **GigaOm** also placed JFrog Xray as the best tool available, beating out other options from Gitlab and Micro Focus.

With each one of these huge leaks -- CapitalOne, Equifax, etc -- the development industry sees another huge shift towards security, and JFrog is positioned to scoop up all of this business. Side note: CapitalOne always presents at JFrog conferences now, and they're a huge champion for JFrog now that they're using JFrog's solution to plug their security holes.

**Company Background**

Founded in 2008, when they launched Artifactory. There is only one direct competitor with similar scope - Sonatype Nexus. Artifactory is both better and cheaper. Sonatype began as a plugin for Artifactory that worked similarly to Xray before Xray was released -- when Sonatype tried to encroach on the ""Universal Repo"" market, JFrog struck back with the release of Xray and nearly killed Sonatype. Sonatype still exists, hanging on by a thread, passed around from one venture capital company to another.

I've used both of these products over the years and have worked in environments with and without. I can say with conviction that Artifactory improves developer productivity significantly and secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by 80%+ the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Apple, Twitter, Tesla, Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook.** These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have a renewal rate of over 90%, with 133% net revenue retention from existing customers **(FYI, this net retention rate is top 10 in the world among SaaS companies).**

They acquired Shippable in 2019 to turn it into JFrog Pipelines, and the CEO has said that they will be using the funds secured via the IPO to continue to do strategic acquisitions. Other acquisitions include Conan, Trainologic, and CloudMunch.

They went public in late 2020 but it was a bit overshadowed, considering they came out the same day as Snowflake.

**Financials**

Comps here are based on the segment they operate in.

DataDog (DDOG) is another development/delivery infrastructure tool mainly centered around performance monitoring which the teams that use JFrog would typically also use. 

Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello, which are used by most software teams for managing development requirements and agile dev team collaboration. They're not exactly a comparable solution, but I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. 

* Net Dollar Retention
   * **FROG: 139%**
   * DDOG: 130%
   * CRWD: 125%
   * TEAM: 132%
* GAAP Earnings: As a high-growth software company, it's not surprising that their GAAP earnings are negative. What is surprising is that they're very close to profitability, and even had a quarter of profitability last year.
   * **FROG: -$0.1861**
   * DDOG: -$0.05
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Market cap:
   * **FROG: $4.9 B**
   * DDOG: $26.3 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Forward P/E Ratio
   * **FROG: 615**
   * DDOG: 666
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* No long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* GAAP Margin is 81%
* Revenue growing 44% YOY, will probably accelerate with acquisitions

**Ownership**

65% owned by insiders and institutions. Most of that ownership is insiders -- there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Fund, IZRL) that own it. ARK just bought another huge block of shares a few days ago. Their final lockup release was 03/15 and there weren't really any huge sales, insider ownership has stayed pretty much the same.

**Summary**

JFrog has a great product, and they are uniquely positioned to corner a growing market (that they invented) which has high barriers to entry. They have proven to be forward-thinking and have fantastic financials.

Like most of you all, I really like Apple. They're a solid company and they keep punching even when it seems like they're a commodity company with commodity products. Barring their crap native macOS apps (cough..calendar) they know what people want to buy and they make incredible margin while they're at it. 

I am overall long on the stock (both equity and options), but very bearish in the short-term. I've taken some big hits and I kept wondering why until I zoomed out. **Apple has retraced every single ATH gap up that I can remember since 2007ish.** Apple has had plenty of gap ups, but the concerning ones are gap ups that take the stock to an ATH. On July 31st, apple gapped up to new ATHs. Obviously it kept going up from there, but it never retraced the original July gap.

Back in July of 2020, [Apple announced a 4:1 stock split.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lcarrel/2020/07/31/apple-announces-4-for-1-stock-split-to-bring-in-new-investors/?sh=62ba0f2b5401) This was around the same time that TSLA did the same thing. There was a ton of market euphoria and guess what happened when apple announced its split? 95 > 108. Nearly a 15% gain in a matter of days. And the stock kept going up from there. Look at that July 31st 2021 ATH gap up. Dang.

So for anyone wondering how low apple will go, my estimate is $95.

I would expect apple to hit $100 close to the end of April - just before earnings

Once the gap fills, I see a steady climb back to $150.

Palantir isn’t Tesla.

And, that’s OK.

TLDR: They’re both innovative, potentially world-changing companies...but they couldn’t be more different...and that will drive short term stock price/market cap.

TESLA

CEO 
- Genius/rebel/hero
- Celebrity meme factory
- Fearless tweeter...420
- Bit enthusiast
- NTF fan

COMPANY - Easy to understand B to C:
- EVs, solar and batteries.

BUSINESS
- Profitability is questionable...selling carbon credits drives current profitability.
- Competitive moat is being eroded. They still lead in battery tech and production, but competition is no longer years away...many auto companies will be launching EVs by 2022.

PRODUCT
- Their cars are sexy, lust-worthy, amazing tech.
- Battery tech/production is years ahead of the competition.

BUZZ
- Legions of fans...EV owners, stonk owners, Musk/TSLA stans.

STONK MOMENTUM
- Driven by tech evangelists, retail enthusiasm and reactionary Wall St momentum traders.
- Most Wall St pros fear shorting this stonk.

THE FUTURE
Strap-in...TSLA stonk is highly volatile...it already 🚀🚀🚀...then dropped a bit...nobody knows exactly where it will go next...the next moves will likely be huge.


PALANTIR

CEO 
- A genius...but, people see the hair and think he’s an eccentric nerd.

COMPANY - Difficult to understand B to B:
- Beyond data mining? AI? Ontology? 
- You literally have to learn PLTR’s capabilities...not many people are up for that.

BUSINESS
- Overall, a very promising company. 
- Their Global TAM is 500B+ and have a clear roadmap for growth/profitability...likely a conservative estimate. 

PRODUCT
- They’ve been developing potentially world changing software for over a decade...funded and battle tested by the DOD/DARPA...this is how Arpanet was developed.
- Their competitive moat is significant...the AWS and IBM partnerships are proof.

BUZZ
- No legions of fans tho...hard to have legions of fans when most will never use this product/understand the capabilities.

STONK MOMENTUM
Totally dependent on tangible results:
- News...Partnerships/Case Studies
- Demos/Case Studies
- Quarterly Revenue/Earnings...would be great to have a blowout quarter...just to flex a bit.

THE FUTURE
PLTR will 🚀🚀🚀...but, it will take time.

3/27/21 04:58,"You're making a mistake if you sell your Tesla shares today. I'm posting this because Tesla is down today and I know a lot of you probably sold. I'm here to help guide you back to the light and hopefully get you to buy back your shares before we close today.

I want to start off by saying a lot of people have been freaking out over the past few weeks because Tesla's market cap is higher than other car manufacturers COMBINED. A lot of people think Tesla is overvalued, but I want to dispel this anti-Tesla heresy by making an analogy:

**Tesla is making the iPod and other manufacturers are still making the SONY Walkman.** 

It is true that as far as a ""cars made"" Tesla has produced fewer ""cars,"" but the product Tesla is making is superior. These types of arguments are illusory because they don't compare apples to apples - they're just trying to put an idea in your head.

Instead of selling your shares - you should be buying more right now. I am not a Tesla cultist in anyway. I'm just point out that the people who are taking a dump on Tesla are intentionally misrepresenting arguments in order to persuade you into agreeing with them. A lot of big money sold Tesla before this move down and I guarantee you they're short the company. They want you to sell and then cover only to buy when it dips into the 500s again.

**How to exit a stock without letting your emotions guide you:**

In all honesty the best piece of advice I can give is to have a check list when you sell any stock. I know a lot of you are like, WhAt'S aN ExiT StrAtEGy? I know a lot of you hate charts so I won't even try to talk about a moving average. But what I will say is this:

1. Ask yourself if you still like the stock.  If it's yes then go to 2. if no, then sell. I don't care why you like a stock, just have an honest conversation with yourself.
2. Ask yourself: Do I need to liquidate these shares because of an emergency? If yes, then liquidate. If no, then hold. 
3. Has GME gone under $100? If yes, then sell all TSLA shares and buy GME. This is obvious, but I thought it needed to be mentioned. I'm joking of course. You should never sell GME shares.

**Closing thoughts:**

Good luck to everyone. Remember, you can buy back in. I'm just saying... I'm also not even sure how to flare this so I'm putting it on as DD. The current price is 607.20. We will see how we go.

I love all of you. Even the bears.

3/29/21 03:06,"QNX hypervisor will be in all future connected EVs (possibly including Tesla as self-driving and vehicle software becomes more regulated) Running multiple OS-es in a single vehicle is going to be a major trend forward (one for instrument clusters, one for infotainment, one for autonomous driving etc.), so hypervisors will be the most foundational software component for connected vehicles. This is why industry experts don't see connected vehicles as ""smartphones on wheels"", they see them as ""data centers on wheels"".

Blackberry's QNX hypervisor is currently the most widely-adopted virtualization platform (arguably the industry-standard) among vehicles that need to run multiple OS-es (instrument clusters: QNX,  infotainment: Automotive Grade Linux/Android Automotive/QNX/Windows Embedded Automotive/AliOS etc). 

The other commercial alternatives in the RTOS hypervisor space (OpenSynergy's COQOS, SysGO's PikeOS, Wind River's VxWorks hypervisor, Green Hills' INTEGRITY) did not find much success in the automotive industry, showing that Blackberry's QNX hypervisor indeed has some stickiness among automakers. In fact, the only 2 hypervisors that currently support VirtIO are QNX hypervisor and COQOS. VirtIO is the upcoming standard that makes the deployment of Android Automotive on vehicles easier by hosting them as virtual machines. 

In other words, if an automaker wants to use Android Automotive as their In-Vehicle Infotainment, the path of least resistance is to either use QNX hypervisors or COQOS because this way the automakers no longer have to implement the Hardware Abstraction Layer required for Android Automotive to work on bare-metal. Android Automotive will likely dominate the infotainment space due to its robust media apps development ecosystem and cross compatibility with the smartphone ecosystem. IVY will provide an interface for Android Automotive app developers to access vehicle sensor and localization data (possible monetization opportunity?). Any forward-looking automaker who wishes to compete with Tesla will definitely choose the Android Automotive + QNX hypervisor (+ Blackberry IVY possibly) stack. Recent examples include Volvo Polestar 2 and Ford. 

QNX also has the largest market share in the digital instrument clusters RTOS space currently. QNX uses a microkernel architecture so it is designed to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements which are essential for instrument clusters and vehicle control. Nobody wants to see their speedometer or brakes lagging behind or their digital dashboard crashing in the middle of the road because this poses safety risk. QNX is ISO 26262 ASIL-D certified, the highest possible safety rating for automotive RTOS. 

AGL is no match in this space due to its monolithic architecture that makes it difficult to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements. Some automakers may choose to use AGL/Linux for now (eg. Tesla), but this is really an unsafe practice and should hopefully be regulated soon. I remember hearing [horror](https://insideevs.com/news/342908/tesla-autopilot-software-crash-while-driving-what-you-need-to-know/) [stories](https://youtu.be/OnJ0jPGmrmM) about Tesla's dashboard crashing and blacking out when the car is still moving on Autopilot on the freeway. Hopefully, as ADAS/self-driving becomes more mainstream, traffic authorities will make ISO 26262 ASIL-D safety certification a legal requirement for all connected vehicles.

On the security side, Blackberry's integration of Cylance into QNX will also be a key differentiator. As vehicles become more connected to the internet, hacking is inevitable and security will be a major requirement for all automakers. To see how scary it can be, see this [Jeep hack](https://youtu.be/MK0SrxBC1xs) video. Blackberry has a great track record in security and its security expertise is world leading, so this is another stickiness of QNX.",43791,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.961221159,True
3/29/21 02:19,"Blackberry QNX + IVY might be the next Android + Google Mobile Services Blackberry as a third-party software provider has the best shot at building an industry-standard vehicle software platform because they do not compete directly with the automakers. 

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will become the industry-standard vehicle data platform.",43794,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.655640841,True

The energy grid as we know is going to change. Currently our grid works like we receive energy from a power plant in our region, and that power plant send energy to our individual homes through power lines

The future of the energy grid is through something called a virtual power plant. Were instead of one power plant fuelling every home in a region, we all distribute energy to each other with batteries.

So we all have batteries in our homes/commercial buildings and can distribute energy to each other, and even if you have your own solar roof, you can generate electricity and sell to your neighbourhood, etc

THIS IS HUGE, and it is happening QUICKER than you think

For those who don’t know, Elon musk is believer in this too, he stated multiple times that Tesla energy will be bigger than the automotive side. Same reason why he’s making a fuck ton of solar roofs/batteries. 

Why I think the push for wide scale of batteries/distributed energy grid is happening right now

Tesla has been quietly installing its own virtual power plants in various regions

They MAKE the software for virtual power plants, so they add there software onto batteries to buy/sell energy to each other/ buy energy when cheap, distribute it to somewhere if their power is out, etc. They have the been collecting data on regions, markets for ever. In fact they even have the biggest network of energy systems connected, with a fuck ton of data. DATA/AI to run thousands of batteries all at once connecting to each other and moving energy around, it constantly learns and knows what to do in every situation, when to move energy at the right price, and where, etc.  There market cap is less than 3 billion. 

Once Elon musk pushes this, which I believe he will soon, Stem inc will rocket too, and even if Stem inc doesn’t become the top player in virtual power plant software, it is a trillion+ market (bigger than the ev market) 

Stem inc doubles their sales in 2020, and already 4xd their sales in 2021 (announced in January, from contracts)


PLEASE RESEARCH Tesla energy, virtual power plants. This is the next big disruption, and stem is a baby company that’s leading it",44098,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999840021,True
4/6/21 10:08,"$GOEV - Bullish theory - USPS Truck Contract Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.


Once I saw the Canoo trucks on their promotional video I thought there is promise for the modularity of them being good candidates for the new USPS truck. But the USPS truck contract was given to Oshkosh Corporation, right? Well maybe. Turns out someone bought 55 million shares before the contract went public. Speculation: If the SEC finds misconduct will the deal be null and void? The vehicles are not due till 2023. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Corporation (I have no idea how government contacts are dealt with)

If the bid is undone I think there are a couple good reasons they are a valid candidate.

**E.V. low speed efficiencies**

Electric Vehicles have insane gains on energy consumption at low speed. 

[Power Consumption Curve for Tesla Model S](https://i.stack.imgur.com/e98Er.png) ([post](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-physics.101931/)). Now I found an [article^1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213624X17300974) that concluded that switching Austin's USPS trucks to diesel trucks would cut down emissions. They used a speed of 15 mhp to run their simulations, note motor vehicles do not get the same energy gains at low speeds as e.v.[1]. I am not gonna even try to factor in the speeding up and down or the real characteristic of the battery pack (there will be energy loss but its Tesla's job to make these batteries as efficient as they can be). The [NEDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) estimates that full charge of 85 kWh can be discharged in 315 miles. User [Frank99](https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/177605/full-charge-range) found he can ride at around 244 Wh/mi for 40 miles at 70 mph. This took Frank 4/7 h or 0.57 hours.
 

With a size of 75k Wh for a total battery comes out to 75k Wh / 244 Wh / mi  = 307.38 miles. Pretty close to the NEDC estimation.

307 mi * (0.57 hours / 40 miles) = 4.385h of driving for an entire charge.

Total Watt hour consumed: 244 Wh/mi * 40 mi = 9.760 kWh

Referring to the first graph the car would be around 300 kW 'consumption' for the majority of the time. The energy spent to hold at that level was 9.760 kWh for 0.57 hours of driving at 70 mph. Now suppose you only need to run to say 15 miles an hour well now you would just need to hold it at 125 kW. Now here's where real research people would know how much of a reduction  in total power consumption this would be. I will guess the reduction to be around 1.5x (9.760 / 1.5 -> 6.467 kWh) this puts the range of the Tesla Model S to over 450 miles before a recharge, but you can kinda just plug in value here and then multiple it with 307 to get your new range. I think anything between 1 and 2 is a good estimate because the reduction in the overall energy cost is a little over 2. 

Now I could not find information on this but I think a USPS truck travel less than 450 miles a day. 

Canoo is probably following Tesla and just letting/following the EPA give their estimated ranges or not even publishing them because so much of the battery life is dependent on the driver's habits.

For viewing pleasure: https://www. yt .com/watch?v=rbnvZlPZZQc

**Modularity**

A general problem for the U.S. has is finding parts for stuff that is old.
The previous USPS fleet truck was designed as Life Long Vehicle and their repair cost went through the roof as time goes on. The USPS even acknowledged this back in 2010 ([pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20100714015726/http://www.uspsoig.gov/foia_files/DA-AR-10-005.pdf)). Per Canoo's promotional video they are focusing on reliability and resell ability.


**Replacing other LLV**

The deal with Oshkosh Corporation was for 50,000 to 165,000 to be produced. In 2010 there were 189,000 LLVs. There could be a cap for 165k LLVs now. Oshkosh could be capped at 50k if the USPS decides to revisit this after the investigation, as I do not think the plan of leaving 90% un-electrified fits with the current party.


[1] Tractor and stuff run at pretty low rpm on diesel so there is a chance to get close to e.v. levels of gains with new science but I haven't done the research, but pulling from article^1 the power consumption is 10x greater with their Diesel van than their electric van listed and they just use money. Coal factories as bad as they are way more efficient than car's when it comes to making energy.

According to which, the expected share price for TSLA is $3,000 in 2025, and in bull case it would be $4,000.

Based on $4,000 PT, it comes down to an average of $2.43 gain per day till January 1st, 2025. An average gain of 0.13% per day would result in the same end result. Neither of these scenario are likely to happen as it is impossible for stock price to move consistently in one direction whether it is dollar gain or percentage gain. This is how it would look like for the both scenarios (broken down in six month intervals).

4/1/21 19:04,"[$BB] Blackberry is well-positioned to benefit from Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan President Biden unveiled the $2.25 trillion [American Jobs Plan](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-ev-rebates-charging-stations/) that includes $174 billion for electrification (building 500,000 EV charging stations, giving direct EV rebates, building EV supply chain in the US) and $270 billion in upgrading train and road infrastructure.

A more robust universally-accessible EV charging infrastructure will accelerate the growth of the entire EV industry and help level the playing field for non-Tesla EVs (Tesla's supercharger network has been a key selling point for Tesla). Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.

Upgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better energy efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world. The [US military](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity-802136475.html) and [NASA](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/computers/article/16707929/space-shuttle-uses-qnx-software-for-camera) have been Blackberry/QNX's major customers for a long time.

It is very likely that Blackberry will win major government contracts soon in this space given its technical expertise in the IoT space and huge engineering workforce in the US.

May I present to you Pacific Gas & Electric; the ultimate infrastructure play. 


$PCG checks not one but two major boxes of the plan that Biden laid out today in his speech. 

1: Electric Vehicle infrastructure

Most of this is already laid out in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmv1q2/pge_launches_ev_fast_charge_program_to_help/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) DD 
The TLDR is that PG&E has a deal with Tesla to promote EV in the Bay area. The company is ALREADY working to improve the EV infrastructure in Northern California, which is home to the largest EV vehicle fleet in the country. ~20% of the EV vehicles in the US


2. Power-line improvements

Now THIS is the part I’m most excited about for PCG. In Bidens speech he directly states “The American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. Protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic super-storms, floods, wildfires, droughts year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient” followed by “My American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work, hundreds of thousands of people to work. Line workers, electricians, and laborers laying thousands of miles of transmission line, building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid”

PG&E, for the last decade, has been NOTORIOUS for their powerline failures and antiquated systems. In fact, the debacle of their power lines starting numerous wildfires in the PNW is the reason for their recent fall from grace starting in 2018. This share used to trade at 70$ before their fall due to settlements. Given the last years fire season, which was the worst EVER on record, there is no doubt in my mind that a huge portion of the infrastructure plan will go towards mitigating the risks of fire in the PNW, and PG&E will get huge amounts of funding to improve their utility infrastructure. The debacle has left the shares in shambles, which are now trading at 11.80 as of this DD

3. Palantir Foundry integration

Oh yeah, I heard you apes LOVE $PLTR. Did you know that PG&E is the FIRST client to integrate foundry software ? Yup. Multimillion dollar deal with them. 


TLDR: This company has been held down by its past mishaps, is too big to fail, and is ripe to benefit from the infrastructure bill.

Cons:

-settlements for fires will bankrupt the company again

-new fires could lead to new settlements

-people fucking hate PG&E as a company. They are not loved


This is not financial advice. I like the stock.

4/15/21 14:17,"""Victory Has Defeated You"" - A quote to remember and live by... A long time ago, back in 2013, I started out with a very small sum on money and subsequently hit the jackpot with my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th option trade. Hitting those consecutive wins really jacked me up (cash-wise and ego-wise). I was just out of college and really began to think I had everything all figured out. Well, as it turned out, I really didn't. I started to lose everything I had gained and clearly I was 'the' fool in the equation.

At around that time one of my favorite movies was The Dark Knight Rises. I would watch it alllll the time when it was on TV. And one day, on a bad-bad-bad market day, I was watching the movie and arrived at this scene:

you(remove-me)tube.com/watch?v=mdM46G984vw

I had an epiphany when I heard the line...I had let victory defeat me. I let those wins cloud my judgement and it made me think I was more than I was. The lucky series of events got to my head and it was clear that I had fallen into this trap of weakness-by-winning.

Over the years I never really forget that phrase. I started to live that phrase in the market - never letting my guard down during the best of times, never letting myself feel like I won...no matter how high the portfolio went. And over time I was able to correct those mistakes I made by ending my option addiction and simply buying stock (cough Tesla cough). And through all the ups and downs over the years, I always kept that phrase in my mind. For awhile it was even my alarm message, so that every morning when the market opened, I ALWAYS remembered how foolish I was in the past.

Ultimately keeping my guard up and never declaring victory led me to the promised land. I now have more cash than I'll ever need. But never again did I let victory defeat me. And eventually not only had I surpassed every financial goal I had set out to achieve, I did it in 7 years instead of 17 years...way earlier than I expected. And now, in a weird way, victory can never defeat me - because I'm not even sitting at the table. Yes I still own stock, a lot of stock, but there's no expiration date and my life no longer revolves around the drama of the day.

Many folks will tell you to ""extend your goals"". Yeah no...that doesn't apply to everything. Sometimes enough money is enough money. Sure, $2 million would be nice...and maybe I'll hit that mark someday soon...but you don't risk everything for more. The first $500k is life-changing, the 2nd $500k not-so-much...so don't risk life-changing money if you have it. There's no harm in hitting 10 home-runs in a row sometimes...you don't need an 11th. And if you keep chasing that dragon, sometimes the dragon chases you back.

And so I leave you all with the quote - Victory Has Defeated You - live it, love it, learn it. Don't let your guard down. Remember, Wall Street is no one friend...if you want a friend on Wall Street, get a dog. And remember to never let your wins make you a loser.

Have a good night :)

Back in February, they squoze to over $5 per share after announcing that they had $19.5m in EV revenues for FY2020, compared to FY2019's $2.7m. The stonk quickly shot down after the big spike up, and has been hovering between $2.50 and $3.50 a share since. They're about to 🚀 to the 🌕 and here's why:

1) This morning they announced that one of their subsidiaries Treelektrik just signed a deal to supply 200,000 electric motorbikes to Indonesia. This indicates growth far beyond a $20m in RV revenue, and this is only one of IDEX's subsidiaries. If the stock will move like it did for a 10x YOY EV sale increase, will it not move like that again for another 10x YOY EV sale increase? 

2) TSLA has been mooning this week, and if you fuckers remember last year (most of you weren't here yet so I'll tell you about it): the broader EV sector is inspired when TSLA moves. Do you think people in Malaysia and Indonesia can afford Tesla vehicles?? No, but they sure do love their little motorbikes (seriously, have you ever seen traffic in these countries?), and they can certainly afford little $2500 motorbikes that don't need to run on gasoline which is becoming more and more expensive. TSLA is king, but their growth is a benefit for smaller EV players as infrastructure grows with it. A rising tide raises all ships, if you don't know this yet turn off your phone and go read some Adam Smith, retard. 

3) Roth Capital just initiated coverage and set a price target of $7 per share, over 3x the current trading price. 

4) DFV identified this as a pick. Do you really want to bet against The One?

Arcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.

TSLA GANG, today was choppy af. TSLA went for the gap fill almost to 661, but held up at 666-669 (which may be possible support for a gap up tomorrow IF no market BS comes up). Looking for a gap up to 690+ run up to touch 700. If TSLA bulls are strong along with the rest of the market, we can fight for the 700 line and end the week 720+. That's my take but then again I'm -40% deep in more retarded calls so hopefully law of attraction works and papa musk hears my prayers.

Locked in gains with ROKU calls and puts early on. Steep drop followed by a quick V recovery because I was playing both ROKU and TSLA calls and puts.

Went in quick AMZN $2900 puts 4/16, in hindsight should've held it to anticipate sell off/breakdown towards EOD. I was too fixated on TSLA and ROKU.

Like a retard, I kept adding on to my TSLA 700c 4/9 position and screenshoted this at  2:10 PM EST but failed to exit. Guess what happened after?

Market sold off + TSLA trying to fill that gap to 661. Ended up holding these bad boys ayyy. That's what happened when you don't follow the golden rule;

IF ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT, ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SELL. Had unloaded and took that -5% loss up there\^, I wouldn't 1. hold this massive fucking bag, and 2. rebuy the 4/16 calls to give me some time even if I believe in the bounce back up / gap up. Hell I could've yolo'd 230k worth with a cost of $3.

My numbers plugged into Options Profit Calculator: [http://opcalc.com/sYl](http://opcalc.com/sYl)I suggest everyone learn how to use this so you can gauge the next day. Plug in your calls/and IV to get the most accurate numbers.

Point your finger at April 8 column and go down to 690. If TSLA is at $690, my position is up 6.84% and so on. If TSLA would've done a end of day rally to say 685-690 or past the high of day to 695, then my position would be 50-98% up.. But it didn't so now I'm bagholding

I started the day with $42k buying power. Bought more of TSLA $700c 4/16 at $11 (lol).

The other $20k I went into AMZN during its big rally. Ended up doing $20k > $80k > $55k because I overtraded AGAIN like a retard.

End of day, I dumped everything into TSLA $700c 4/16.

4/6/21 06:50,"The Bull-Case for Lordstown Motors Corporation (RIDE) – Never Bet Against America Disclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion.

&#x200B;

Recently, [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report.

Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down.

And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things:

1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC.
2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth.

Okay, let’s get started.

&#x200B;

**First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.**

Per Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

U.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\*\*\*\*.”*

“I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye.

&#x200B;

**Now, onto an overview of LMC:**

GM invested in LMC back in 2019 in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). They are working towards mass production this September with their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance).  [LMC now has over 500 employees with plans to be at 1,500 by production this September](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio). They believe that when the facility is at full capacity in 3-5 years, they will be able to produce 600,000 vehicles a year, due to the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all).

&#x200B;

**Enter Short-Seller Hindenburg Research, who first announced they took a short position in RIDE stock last month, and then slandered them in the media just to make a profit:**

I will now break down the main components of Hindenburg’s “research report.” Let’s jump right in.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC is 3-4 years away from production**

Hindenburg claims that they spoke to some “undisclosed former employees” who told them that LMC is way behind on beta production and won’t be able to actually produce anything until 2024 or 2025. Hindenburg didn’t even request to take a tour of LMC’s facility to back-up their claims.

Well, at the end of last week, LMC proved this wrong by [revealing their first betas](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas). This shows that they are very close to mass-production; these betas are coming off the production line and [being welded by robots](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). These betas are essentially 97% of the finished vehicle, and will be [used for crash, engineering and validation testing](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Betas will also be given to initial customers for feedback. LMC’s Endurance already has a 5-Star crash test rating via software crash simulation. Plus, contrary to Hindenburg’s report, LMC confirmed that production is still on target for September of this year.

The betas are going to be a huge catalyst for the stock going forward, and they were just publicly revealed at the end of last week. Now, LMC plans to produce one beta every day for the next 2 months.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that a LMC development mule that caught fire in January was the “first ever test-drive”**

Well, if the first ever test drive was in January, why is there video evidence of test drives as early as [October](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1321504690362818567?s=20) and [November](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?s=20) of last year? Clearly, this vehicle has been on the road for well over 7 months now. Also, the development mule that caught fire [had already been addressed a couple of months ago by LMC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire) prior to Hindenburg’s report.

Ultimately, that development mule was not built on the assembly line and it was not using the actual batteries that their truck will utilize. It caught on fire as a result of human error, which will not be the case going forward since they are at beta phase with robots are welding the trucks instead of humans.

To address the fire / battery issue, [LMC announced they will now use “Tesla” batteries from LG Chem](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.). Oh, and what do you know, [LG Chem is partnering with GM to build batteries right next to LMC’s facility](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/gm-lg-lordstown-ultium-cells-hiring/). 

Btw - that’s Marcus Lemonis (CEO of Camping World) driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a [long-term partnership with LMC](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

Plans for the 1st ever all-electric RV are being released this summer by LMC in conjunction with Camping World. As a reminder, the [North American RV market is valued at \~ $27 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-recreational-vehicle-market), and the growth has actually accelerated due to the pandemic. Enormous opportunity here for both LMC and Camping World with the world’s first ever all-electric RV.

This claim by Hindenburg about January being “the first ever test-drive” is clearly false.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC’s 100,000 pre-orders are largely fictitious / SEC also “inquires” about pre-orders**

First and foremost, the SEC opens thousands of “inquiries” each year. This is not an investigation, even though all of the click-bait articles going around right now would make you think it was. These sites literally make money based on clicks, which is why the media has also blown the story out of proportion – just to get increased viewership. That’s the sad reality of the world we live in.

This is currently a voluntary reveal of information and documents from LMC to the SEC, and they are fully cooperating. This type of thing has happened to Tesla countless times, and many other start-ups as well. I will include a brief example in the comments below on how Wall Street capitalizes from FUD when the SEC gets involved.

Additionally, regarding the pre-orders, go look at basically ANY EV company. They all utilize *non-binding pre-orders*. [LMC has made this clear from day 1](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-remains-on-track-to-begin-production-of-the-lordstown-endurance-in-the-fall-of-2021) – all pre-orders are non-binding letters of intent (LOI). LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house.

Hindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren’t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they’ve put on paper – and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the [E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/#:~:text=The%20Hindenburg%20report%20also%20said%20Lordstown%20Motors%20allegedly,Energy%2C%20came%20to%20the%20defense%20of%20Lordstown%20Motors.) after Hindenburg’s report and confirmed he still plans to fill all 14,000 orders over a 3-year period.

&#x200B;

**What Hindenburg failed to understand during their “research”**

Lordstown is targeting fleets: fleets don’t always buy directly from auto manufacturers. They frequently buy from intermediaries and service partners. Most commonly, these intermediaries and service partners are small/medium sized companies, and it’s critical to develop relationships with these types of partners early and often.

Developing these relationships is exactly what LMC is doing, as they recently announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).

Sure, not all 100,000 of the current pre-orders will come to fruition for LMC, but demand isn’t the issue here. LMC is putting out a [simple and economical vehicle for fleets](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/). What do fleet managers care about? Cost and efficiency.

LMC’s all-electric *Endurance* truck comes in at a $45,000 price point, and the simplicity of the vehicle will lead to less maintenance and a lower total cost of ownership than any options currently available to fleets. This is a no brainer.

LMC firmly believes their demand is robust, and they have already said they are going to sell way more than they can even produce the first two years. All of the talk from the recent Infrastructure bill/proposal sure helps LMC’s future prospects as well. They also have stated that they have interest from the gov/military for the federal fleet, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).

&#x200B;

**And lastly, Hindenburg makes claims that CEO Steve Burns is a con-man**

I decided to do some deep digging on this. Was there a chance he was trying to pump up the stock price in the short-term by over-exaggerating orders so he could dump off his shares for profit like the Nikola founder did?

What I found by digging deep through [LMC’s form 10-K](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001558370-21-003449) was that, this is not the case. Burns doesn’t really have incentive to pump-up the stock in the short-term with the pre-order announcements. This is because, per page 33 of the 10-K, “any shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will be locked-up until October 23, 2021, and 50% of such shares will continue to be locked up until October 23, 2022.”

&#x200B;

**Why is this finding significant?**

Well, this means that Burns can’t sell a single share until AT LEAST October 23 of this year. In fact, I think this creates a HUGE incentive for him to hit their September production target.

Think about everything the Lordstown community has been through last few years, and now a short-seller comes out with a bunch of inaccurate claims to slander LMC’s reputation in the media just to turn a profit.

I would be willing to bet that LMC now has a huge chip on their shoulder to continue to prove all of the doubters and short-sellers wrong. LMC made significant progress in refuting Hindenburg’s claims by having betas coming off the assembly line at the end of last week. Actions speak louder than words.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

Hindenburg made several inaccurate accusations in their report, and as a result, I view $RIDE as one of the best buying opportunities that I have ever seen in my 5+ years of investing. I will be watching this stock very closely in the next week or so, and I will look to increase my position substantially if this touches $11.

Sure, there are risks. But, even with minor setbacks, LMC has shown they are very close to mass-production. They will soon have the first all-electric *full-size* pick-up truck for fleets. These things will sell like hot cakes once they begin production.

&#x200B;

**Position:**

500 shares that I will be holding onto for several years, and I am looking to add October calls for once they are pumping out trucks this fall.

I’m not directly comparing LMC to Rivian; but, think about it like this: Rivian’s expected IPO valuation is $50B this year. RIDE currently has a $1.9B market cap. So, If LMC is able to achieve even half ($25B) of Rivian’s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

[Lordstown Motors is going to change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20) – literally an American underdog story. It’s a damn shame that Hindenburg wrongfully attacked a company in small-town Ohio that is bringing 1000’s of jobs to our country.

4/6/21 00:06,"TSLA effective short interest could be as high as 26% - potential incoming short squeeze **TL;DR:** TSLA short interest is not 5% as reported, but 26% due to float contraction & options bets, making the stock susceptible to a short squeeze.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

TL:DR: Tesla is priced way past perfection by literally every valuation method.

**APRIL 9, 2021**

**Company and Industry**

Tesla was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California. The company operates two segments: automotive manufacturing and consumer solar energy. The automotive manufacturing segment builds and sells automotive vehicles. The consumer solar energy segment manufactures and sells solar energy generation to residential customers (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). Tesla’s core business model across both segments relies heavily on state and federal government subsidies in order to operate (“Tesla 10-Q”, 2020). The company is traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker, TSLA.

**Market Capitalization**

On February 3, 2020, Tesla had a market capitalization of $136.9 billion. On March 1, 2021, Tesla had a market capitalization of $557.9 billion (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). This represents a 307.52% increase in Tesla’s market capitalization between February 2020 and March 2021. At the time of this writing, on April 9, Tesla had a market capitalization of $649 billion.

Tesla’s current market capitalization defies all rational explanations as it is being valued more than Ford, General Motors, Tata Motors, Honda Motors, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Mazda, Nissan, Porsche, and Volkswagen all combined (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). To assert that Tesla is more valuable than the worldwide automotive industry is a ridiculous proposition that is not substantiated by either business fundamentals, nor future growth prospects.

**Stock Price and Employee Information**

Tesla stock price also had parabolic movement as the stock price increased 360.53% 

between February 2020 and March 2021. On February 3, 2020, Tesla closed at $153.00. By March 1, 2021, Tesla closed at $718.43 (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.).

As of December 31, 2020, Tesla employed 70,757 employees. This represents a 47.36% increase in employees when compared to December 31, 2019, when Tesla had 48,016 employees.

**Response to COVID-19**

Tesla was affected by the Covid-19 epidemic that disrupted global trade in 2020. At the start of the pandemic, Tesla received an undisclosed amount of government assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program (“Tesla 10-Q”, 2020). When California went into lockdown on March 18, 2020, Tesla’s Fremont, CA factory continued its operations. Elon Musk was defiant in his insistence that Tesla’s operations not be disrupted even with the virus spreading throughout California (""Elon Musk v. Public Health"", 2020). 

After public outcry, Tesla shut down the California factory on March 23, 2020. However, by May 11, 2020, Elon Musk resumed operations at the Fremont, CA factory in defiance of the state law. By May 13, 2020, Alameda County, CA withdrew their enforcement of the law and allowed Tesla to continue operations as long as they followed social distancing measures (""Elon Musk v. Public Health"", 2020). It is unclear if there was any actual oversight or enforcement of those policies. By November, 2020, California had granted Tesla “essential workforce” exemption (Kolodny, 2020). While there are no consistently reported figures, it is estimated that over 400 Tesla employees contracted SARS-CoV-2 between May and December 2020 (Boudette, 2021).

**Analysis of COVID-19 Response**

Tesla’s source of value is derived from automotive sales of the Model 3 and the Model Y, both of which are only manufactured in Fremont, CA and Shanghai, China. Going into 2020, Tesla only had $8.2 billion in quick assets and $10.7 billion in quick liabilities (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). With a quick ratio of 0.76, Tesla was in a vulnerable position when the COVID-19 pandemic started. Shutting down the Fremont factory in accordance with state law would likely have been catastrophic to Tesla’s financial health, as the company has often been in a precarious financial balance between solvency and insolvency. *(Note: Tesla has nearly gone bankrupt in 2008, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Elon has a gift for doing magic tricks and buying himself more time)*

This uncertain situation is likely what drove Elon Musk to be so defiant about the company’s operations and eventually caused him to rebel against the state’s legal measures to shut down all but essential businesses, of which Tesla is not. This is also the likely motivation behind the stock dilution seen in Q3 and Q4 2020, when Tesla issued more stock and raised $12.686 billion (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). A curious observation is found when looking at the cash flow from operating activities and comparing it to cash flow from financing activities. Year-over-year, Tesla is a company that consistently subsists itself through financing activity, not operating activity (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.).

When looking over all of the relevant information, it is clear that Tesla did what it had to do in order to remain solvent. However, it is also clear that they were entirely fixated on staying operational at any cost, even if it meant its own employees were put at risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2. Employees should re-evaluate their relationship with Tesla and decide if the company views them as an asset, or an expendable resource. Tesla’s efforts in this regard were found wanting.

**SWOT Analysis**

Tesla’s strength is really down to the cult of personality surrounding Elon Musk. For better or for worse, without Elon Musk’s personal brand, Tesla would have gone bankrupt long ago because it is not a sustainable business model. Tesla has survived through a combination of a secular bull market, dovish monetary policy, generous fiscal policy, corporate welfare, and legions of wishful thinking investors (Strauss & Smith, 2019).

The weakness surrounding Tesla is that despite what seems to be carefully crafted earnings management, the core business of Tesla is not profitable and may never be profitable. A counter argument may be that other automotive manufacturers also have razor thin margins and not the best balance sheets. This is a fair argument, but it is important to point out that Ford Motors and General Motors have vastly higher revenues than Tesla, and they rely on cash flow from operating activities, not financing activities, to stay solvent.

There are many threats that Tesla is facing. Tesla has many eerie similarities to Enron (NYSE: ENE). Enron executives were publicly hostile towards short sellers and Elon Musk is particularly vocal about his disdain for short sellers (Niedermeyer, 2019). Enron was routinely hailed as a futuristic, innovative disruptor that was changing the world. *(Note: You can read more about this in Niedermeyer's book. Also read more* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/bq06lc/the_smartest_guys_in_the_room_eerily_describes/)*,* [*here*](https://fortune.com/2020/12/10/tsla-tesla-stock-overvalued-investors-jpmorgan-spx-s-and-p-500/)*, and* [*here*](https://nypost.com/2021/01/20/jim-chanos-still-shorting-tesla-just-more-cautiously/)*)* 

Tesla is also facing increasing competition from well established automakers like Ford Motors and General Motors. These automakers can undoubtedly make a better electric vehicle (EV) than Tesla at a more attractive price point for consumers. As such, they will continue to take market share away from Tesla, and may eventually take over the company (MacDuffie, 2018).

While China has been seen as the promised land for Tesla's profitability, China has many state-sponsored investments into their own companies such as XPeng (Kharpal, 2021) and Nio (""Nio Motors Has"", n.d.). From a geopolitical perspective, it is unlikely that the Chinese government will allow a U.S. business to dominate their own EV market. *(Note: they absofuckingloutely will not allow this to happen)*

The opportunity that Tesla really has is the new administration in Washington D.C., which has recently unveiled a bill entitled “The American Jobs Plan” (""American Jobs Plan"", 2021), which will invest up to $3 trillion over the next 15 years. Much of this bill will involve infrastructure and clean energy initiatives. This is something that Tesla will undoubtedly capitalize on and enjoy the juicy resources provided to them, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. Regardless of sentiment, this fresh capital influx will likely stimulate the company’s operations and allow them to continue operations for the foreseeable future.

**Recommendations and Predictions**

Using a valuation based on comparable firms (Berk, et al., 2017), Tesla’s intrinsic value is much closer to $32.82/per share with a current book value of $24.03 (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). With 959,854,000 shares outstanding, this fair value would give Tesla a more realistic market capitalization of $31.5 billion (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). This market capitalization would be comparable to other auto manufacturers, like Ford and General Motors. However, this represents a 95% decrease in the current market price of Tesla. This would still be a generous valuation for Tesla as at $32.82 per share, because the PE ratio would be around 51 and still far higher than the industry average of around 24.

To be even more generous, one could give Tesla a valuation based upon the discounted free cash flow (DFCF) method (Berk, et al., 2017). This would give Tesla a market capitalization of $312.9 billion, and a valuation of $325.89 per share, yet this is still 51.86% lower than where the market is currently pricing the stock at. This DFCF valuation uses a discount rate of 11% and operates on the assumption that Tesla’s earnings will grow by 50% every single year through 2026 before leveling off at a 10% earnings growth rate from 2027 onward. This simply is not practical, as Tesla’s revenue growth has only been forecasted to grow at 33% every year through 2023. It is safe to say that Tesla has already been “priced to perfection” and then some. 

While the story of Tesla has largely been a successful example of “fake it until you make it”, reality will eventually catch up to Tesla, whose brand is inseparable from the brand of Elon Musk. Were this a street report, the coverage would be initiated with a “Strong Sell” recommendation and a $33.00 price target.

In order for Tesla to justify its unreasonable valuation, the company will need to demonstrate that it can achieve sustainable profitability without the extensive use of government welfare in the form of rebates and subsidies that are paid for by U.S. taxpayers. To that end, it needs to increase operating margin expansion and drive new revenue growth through licensing. The licensing of its proprietary software and intellectual property to other automotive manufacturers might be its only saving grace in the years to come as more experienced auto manufacturers take market share from Tesla in the EV space.

4/11/21 01:38,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjzvwy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made last week. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**                     

https://preview.redd.it/1dwe1p42xcs61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a120cb970f727a95b925dca045324d6d551ba473

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock though there has been a significant drop in the overall number of mentions (last week GME was mentioned 27K times). Tesla is now the number 2 most discussed stock. Facebook is the newcomer into the top 10 list but not in a good way. They had one of the largest data leaks (533 Million customers data was compromised) and the users were understandably pissed. The average sentiment across the comments reflects that. ASO also made it into the top 10 due to chatter on the stellar earnings report as well as the high short interest on the company.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/0l6jei65xcs61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=3008545684de903944b2b4840d2c7e428e1442d9

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. 

**Romeo Power ($RMO)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. The stock was trending due to a 60% jump in stock price on Tuesday following a strategic deal they announced with truck giant PACCAR. 

**Nano-X Imaging($NNOX)** is a medical imaging technology company. They recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. NNOX’s CEO has said that the company is on track to commence system shipment’s from Q4'21. The company’s stock price shot up 20% only to lose over the next week.

**Academy Sports($ASO)** has been on the top growing stocks for two weeks now (which in turn made the stock figure in the top 10 most discussed stocks list). The company was mentioned heavily due to its stellar earnings report (EPS was an impressive 41% ahead of analyst estimates). Adding to this, the company is heavily shorted (\~40% short interest) and the stock price is expected to be highly volatile.

**Facebook($FB)** as discussed above was trending due to their data leak which exposed the user data of more than half-billion users. 

**Norwegian Cruise line($NCLH)** was generating discussions as its CEO has sent a proposal to the CDC on how the company could safely travel once again in July. The company is also planning to resume cruise operations for voyages boarding outside of the United States with sailings originating in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Greece starting in July 2021.

**SOME FAQ’s:** 

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

The stock is trading well below its worth because of recent market turmoil and investors not yet grasping Moderna's endpoint. I have a history of buying call options on Moderna when it went on sale.

**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a scientist and I work at NYU and the CDC. Back in February 19 2020 before there was a single documented case of COVID in NYC my colleague (Dr. Mark Mulligan) hosted a seminar titled ""2019 Novel Coronavirus - A Pandemic Threat"" -- WHO was still hesitant to call COVID a PHEIC and the CDC was currently making recommendations against wearing masks. Mark shared that Moderna was a promising company and poised to deliver a vaccine for COVID sooner than anyone else and faster than anyone else had ever done in the history of the vaccine world. Mark went on to lead the clinical trials for Pfizer. A little over a year later and I'm fully vaccinated with Moderna.

On May 22, 2013 Tesla announced that it paid of its DoE loan 9 years early. It was roughly $19.42, it's now worth 34x as much. Moderna didn't get a DoE loan but they got grant funding and revenue well ahead of their financial plan. They're in a phenomenal position to do three things:

1. Increase production for their current operations
2. Fund additional research in flu vaccines and cancer
3. Pay back debt much earlier than initially projected just like Tesla did

A few times in a decade an innovation comes along that makes a great leap forward. Moderna is one of those leaps forward. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky started the artificial intelligence boom known as deep learning as he advanced an old idea that NYU professor Yann LeCun pioneered in the 90s, the major difference was timing -- both GPUs and data matured in a way where neural networks could flourish. Less than one year later Rob Fergus at NYU reproduced this work, demonstrating one of the most important conditions for growth -- reproducibility. For the vast majority of biotech companies in clinical trials, you're rolling a dice and crossing your fingers. Moderna's approach works, just like neural networks worked -- they will reproduce and mature their technology and apply it to numerous serious diseases and will soon have an expansive portfolio beyond COVID vaccines. Moderna (MRNA) and BioNTech have shown the technology behind MRNA is reproducible and primed to flourish -- MRNA is on a similar trajectory as deep learning. MRNA isn't a new idea nor were neural networks or electric cars, timing is everything.

Moderna makes highly effective vaccines for COVID and Flu (soon) that can be developed in a fraction of the time. That's not even the most exciting thing about this company. Moderna and BioNTech may truly treat cancer and not in the way that clickbait articles promise -- but in the way that we used to see HIV as a life threatening disease and now we see it as a treatable and manageable condition. Moderna will benefit from its highly optimized and nimble operations, it's running at a pace that other companies will struggle to catch up with. While BioNTech has talented scientists they needed Pfizer to hold their hands, Moderna (MRNA) has proven far more self-sufficient in navigating the world of business. AZN, NVAX, J&J -> have proven to be poorer choices. They're slower to deliver, they overpromised and underdelivered (J&J), they're less efficacious and more dangerous (AZN). Meanwhile Moderna is scaling up operations to deliver more than projected.

**Longer term catalysts:** Making highly tailored personalized medicine to treat once life-threatening diseases \~2030

4/19/21 12:24,"DD: Boomer Edition - CSX earnings this week For this week's Boomer Dick and Dividends we look once again at 🚂🚂Choo Choo!  No one knows what the fuck is going on with CLOV hard to tell with that ticker if they are selling healthcare or some other clever name for weed stonks anyway.  RIDE bombed out of their Desert race so EVs that aren't Tesla are going to remain fucked because it seems like new millennial mechanics can't figure out how to actually use a DC motor after hyping it for over a decade. (Hint: Plug in motor = ⏩⏩) 

CSX is set for earnings this week and they will almost certainly beat expectations.

Why?  Well there is a handy tool to track rail traffic for CSX available on their own site to track performance metrics which includes the number of rail cars online at any given time.

https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/customers/performance-measures/

If you download the data it shows that the number of cars online hasn't been this high since 2018 (so not just beating out the pandemic numbers but smashing 2019 as well).  Previous years had much higher numbers but CSX did major efficiency cuts in 2017 that removed thousands of employees and areas that weren't running well.  (You can also see in the data velocity in 2017 was 14.7mph and is now 20mph).  

The short of it is that rail traffic appears to be up about 17% (technically it is 17% more cars online at a given time) while earnings estimates are pegging it at a 7% increase.

(Example of earning estimate stating this just recently https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-report-q1-earnings-low-155803201.html)

On top of that the the rail cost index was near an all time high in Q1 (https://www.aar.org/rail-cost-indexes/) which means that prices on rail freight were UP UP UP.  So they are moving more 🚂and charging 💵💰.  If you looks at earnings estimates regardless of the firm everyone seems to be pegging them at a slight increase from 2020 when the 17% increase was a sharp and almost immediate change on the year.  

If you need further confirmation from a non-CSX source the AAR also confirms that traffic is back to prepandemic levels of you remove the february blip from the Texas freeze.  CSX doesn't operate any lines in Texas so it is reasonable to assume that they weren't majorly impacted as their own data displays. https://www.aar.org/data-center/rail-traffic-data/

To top it off there is not a single part of the transportation industry that isn't struggling to meet demand right now.  CSX isn't going to be a magical exception and just have small growth when they have major lines throughout the major manufacturing centers of the Eastern US.  You can bet that they are doing it with less employees due to across the board labor shortages (listed as a concern in their annual report) and with an increasingly energy efficient line of 🚂 since they have been investing in and showing upgrades for years.

Pros: 

CSX is a profit heavy industry with government support that consistently out paces SPY as a long term investment even if you ignore the 1% per year dividend.

CSX is going to beat earnings because earnings were assuming moderate recovery vs the explosive recovery we got.  Almost no reason to doubt this and no reason to doubt they continue to do well throughout the year because as you can see in sky rocketing commodities pricing we simply cannot meat the demand for materials right now.  🚂 Are much 💪 vs tiny 🚛 when it comes to moving things like wood, steel and copper across the nation to be processed.

CSX didn't get hit by the Texas shutdown as they are an east coast outlet.  This means they will look better than several competitors with lines closer to or inside of Texas

CSX like all the major railroads prints money with a 27%ish profit margin year to year.  Railroads are a lifeblood to American supply lines that tend to do alright even in bad years.  Government support and regulations keep the industry wide stability and growth in place with more and more companies realizing that rail is the ideal way to move bulk goods when you have smart systems to plan around the delivery dates.  As long as Tony Musk and Tim 🍏 don't start shooting our goods down 🧲 tubes soon railroads are going to be good for a while.  

Cons: Good earnings reports don't always mean good stock prices 😕🙃.  Lots of unexpected things can come up and sometimes the stock gets bought up leading to the report and then dumped.  (Stonks did not like the last report but it also wasn't really that good).  $CSX did show very strong and steady growth after the last report so the real question is if there is a drop off on the report or not.  I lean towards no dip but it would suck to buy now and miss the dip since the last one was $10 drop 😕🚂💥.  

Time based Efficiency metrics are down a bit for Q1.  Trains are slightly slower and dwell times at stations are slightly longer.  Mostly labor based but it's still an issue for the slowest form of transit to move slower (note that vs 4 years ago they are 30%+ better).

Boomer Points:. 
🚂 Are an amazing and under appreciated form of transportation.  They are incredibly 👕 so the Democrats currently in power love them and they are big tough machines so Republicans tend to love them too!  It's vastly agreed upon that is long as you are a properly 💉 citizen that you will almost certainly love 🚂 and the way they follow simple patterns too!  💉💉💉💉⬆️🆙⏫=🚂🚂🚂🚂⏫🆙⬆️

Dividends: Essentially comes out to about 1% of the stock price per year if you hold it that long.  More or less free growth on something already beating SPY YOY.

Positions: I don't have any 😕.  Just saw this coming weeks earning notice has CSX.  Looked and saw it didn't appear to have a pre-earnings spike and decided that the rail data should probably show increased traffic since my companies rail cars keep getting stuck in station traffic.  The data shows a 17% increase in traffic and now I wish I had $CSX but I can't buy it til tomorrow.

Recommendations: Worst case scenario is probably that earnings randomly tank it for no good reason.  Last time it took a month to recover on bad earnings so if you aren't going to do shares then buy a call that ends a month from now.  No puts.  🚂💥🌈🐻",44942,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999090791,True

4/18/21 07:17,"Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD I’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through. 

I won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze.",44969,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.977953136,True

4/16/21 09:20,"PLUG is incredibly oversold and way under current stock valuation... And why it's going up at least 100%. PLUG is down over 60% from it's ATH. The renewable energy market was overbought and PLUG needed a pullback, similar to TSLA/NIO/FCEL/etc.

Bad News:

It got hit with an accounting error because of their auditors, KPMG. PLUG (mainly KPMG) has to reinstate it's financial results from 2018 to 2020. This caused investors to lose trust and tumble the stock into way oversold territory. Most analysts summarized the accounting issues to appear as minor but short-term worrisome, and there's limited near-term upside until resolution. This issue was 1 month ago when PLUG was trading around $48. It's nearly fallen by 50% since then.

Multiple law firms, primarily lead by ""Gross Law Firm"", also announced a class action lawsuit against PLUG. Causing it to drop ~10% more. Looking into Gross Law Firm, that's their entire business model, suing companies on behalf of shareholders on stocks that aren't performing well enough. In April alone they have opened up 9 new lawsuits against varies companies. Records show that most are settled out of court or completely dropped. In 2018 Gross Law Firm also opened a class action lawsuit against Tesla and look where TSLA is now.

Good News:

Wall Street already grossly underestimates the hydrogen energy sector. Currently Wall Street is valuing Hydrogen Energy to be roughly 1% of the world's energy. But forecasts show by 2025 it'll be between 5-12%. PLUG is the leading green energy hydrogen company. The O&G industry has reduced lobbying against Hydrogen Energy and is joining the sector: Chevron and Shell joined the Hydrogen Energy Council last year, and Exxon this year. The transition to Hydrogen Energy is starting to explode.

Last week PLUG was invited by the US department of defense to apply for a new $520 million loan guarantee. This news was still overshadowed by the accounting errors and hasn't reacted fully from it.  Upcoming news from the Biden administration will show they are ready, willing and able to provide strong support for hydrogen projects, increasing the valuating of PLUG.

Upon receiving approval from the DoE, PLUG will utilize its electrolyzer, liquefaction and distribution technologies to deploy the first resilient network of zero-carbon hydrogen production facilities across the United States. The facilities will have a combined liquid hydrogen generation capacity of approximately 180 tons per day. 

Let's review their balance sheet. PLUG also has over 1.3B of cash on hand. 1.6B in current assets and 800M in other assets. It has roughly ONLY 236M in current liabilities giving PLUG a huge advantage to invest in future energy projects mentioned above. OR settle any accounting issues, fines, or lawsuits. BABA (45x larger company) settled a $2.4B fine and the shares JUMPED 9% because investors were no longer worried, uncertainty was behind them. When PLUG reinstates it's accounting issues the stock WILL jump. Also, PLUG's 2021 financial reports have no errors and do not need to be reinstated. This is a problem in their past they need to solve.

PLUG also already has major contract supply deals with many top companies, including Amazon and Walmart, which are also current investors of PLUG. PLUG is working with Walmart to provide it with fuel cell-powered vehicles. There are plans for expansion of this deal sometime in 2021.

Looking at current analyst's price targets, 69% (ayyy) of analyst say BUY, only 1 (6%) says to SELL. The LOWEST price target for PLUG is $29, nearly $3 lower than today's close. The HIGHEST is $78, just a few dollars short of its 52-week high. Average is $57, which is 115% upside. Read this again... the lowest... price target... on PLUG... is $29. That is HIGHER than its current stock price.

For those who care about TA, even with over a 500% 1Y gain on PLUG, PLUG has just reached oversold territory based on a RSI of 30. For shorter term traders: the 4h and 1h are also hovering around 30. The Stochastic lines have crossed in every time measure, and it's entering an uptrend off the lows of today. Even if you don't believe PLUG long term, there's potential for a quick gain as this flies back to its support of $28-32 in the week or two.

TL;DR: PLUG is grossly oversold and will bounce back to around $30 in a couple weeks. Good news is being overshadowed by an accounting error and when that problem is settled, PLUG will fly. Average price target is $58, but my price target is $75 by EoY. Based on cash flow, Biden administration push for renewable energy, clean energy sector growing, and PLUG's plan for Hydrogen production facilities and vehicle research/production, PLUG can easily hit that $75 price sooner.

Positions: I've already purchased 60k in $25 and $30 strike calls expiring 1/2023. I plan to increase that by another 40k soon. If PLUG hits the average analyst price target by January of next year, I'll close my position when it crosses $500,000 value.",45085,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.998263657,True

4/15/21 16:26,"The most logical APHA/TLRY Merger Play that know one is talking about Okay so long story short, merger date is coming up.  This may sound stupid but it’s actually the most logical play that know one is thinking or talking about. So TLRY is buying out APHA and therefore your APHA shares will convert to TLRY shares. TLRY is the bigger more valuable company. If you have 500 dollars in APHA it will be converted to TLRY regardless of the share price.  

Here’s where the hidden logic comes in. The best play is to accumulate as much APHA and drive the price up as high as possible, squeeze out the rest of the shorts and hold.

On the other end of the spectrum sell all of your TLRY shares and beat this ticker to the curb. The lower this goes the better. TLRY actually has a high short interest but trust me let the gay bears have this one.

If the APHA shares can surpass the price of the TLRY shares it will be bigger than the original moon landing.  

Once the merger happens those who have 💎👐’s will be rewarded with more TLRY shares than they had APHA shares.  TLRY will then way undervalued and everyone will start to pile in.

If you still don’t get it, imagine TSLA buying out NKLA, you’d want NKLA to be as high as possible at the merger and TSLA as low as possible.

4/15/21 08:33,"What happened today with PLTR is completely normal  

I know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.

However, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.

Now before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.

4/29/21 09:05,"Elon Musk and Tesla 'bearish' case Okay this might sound a bit weird but I've been thinking about how important Elon Musk is to Tesla or in particular to Tesla's investors and I was wondering if you could actually make money by betting on 'something' happening to Elon Musk. 

Now imagine Elon Musk dying tomorrow. I genuinely hope we will not have to see that in the news any time soon... but just imagine. How much would Tesla's stock drop? Probably more than 50% right?

Okay so what if someone were to buy deep OTM Tesla puts every month? Let's do some math.

Currently Tesla trades around 700. Since Tesla is expected to fall more than 50% if something happens to Elon Musk, let's look at 350 puts.
350 puts expiring May 28th are currently trading at 0.37. (https://imgur.com/gallery/uBJEIC8)

If someone buys 1 Tesla put with strike price 50% away from underlying every month, the costs the first year would be 1 * 37 * 12 = $444
The older people become, the higher chance of dying. Now let's say this someone buys 1 more put per month the second year, and one more the third year, and so on, then the yearly costs will increase by $444 every year. 

Musk is 49 years old. The average life expectancy in the United States is 78 years. Assuming Elon lives an average life, he has 29 years left. https://imgur.com/gallery/8diuHNx

Increasing the amount of monthly puts by 1 every year will make the total costs in the next 29 years:
15 * 29 * 37 * 12 = $193140

If Elon Musk were to die exactly at average life expectancy in the United States, then those 29 puts would need to make $193140 in profit to have gains overall. 
193140/29 = 6660 -> Every put would need to make $6660 profit. This means (simplified) that the price of the underlying needs to go 66 points below the strike price, which is 50% below underlying at the beginning of the month.

Using todays stock price, that would mean that Tesla needs to fall to about (350-66) 284 following Elon Musk's hypothetical death.

I'm actually surprised to see that this could be a working strategy. First I looked at a fixed amount of puts every month but that would make it harder to turn a profit and also doesn't make sense since someone at age 49 does not have the same chance of dying as a 70 year old.

This is mostly a joke, I'm not actually going to do this (I think) but I was interested in the actual math so I said why not post it in WSB.

4/24/21 07:45,"The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - April 19th to April 23rd What’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season is in full swing this week, and the markets were volatile. Boatloads of news, combined with a healthy amount of FUD was dropped this week, and I wasn’t around to observe the markets until Thursday, so this recap will be a little bit more bare than most. Apologies in advance. If you want a copy of the newspaper early, feel free to see the links on my profile! With all that being said, let's get into it.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, the media decided to spread some FUD regarding TSLA** after reports revealed that two people died after a driverless crash in Texas. TSLA shares initially slid 6%, until people pointed out that *literally nobody was driving the fucking car*, meaning that the owner purposely managed to bypass all safety measures in order to avoid outright driving the car. Fuk a weight sensor, fuk a seatbelt sensor, fuk a steering wheel sensor, and fuk the bears, buddy put a case of beer or something in the divers seat while he went to plow his Tinder date in the back seat. Despite this gut wrenching news, TSLA closed the week up 4%.

&nbsp;


- To add to the FUD on Monday, **The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill** if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March, *nearly two months ago*, during a treadmill accident. America really decided to snitch on PTON over some old old beef just to put my calls OTM, kill me man. This headline is extra stupid cause a small child and animal can die on ANY treadmill, not exclusively a PTON one. PTON never actually recovered, and closed the week down 7%. Guh.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, Netflix reported some disastrous earnings**. Netflix beat on earnings a bit, but then casually tried to slip in the fact that they lost nearly HALF of their yearly subscriber growth, reporting 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected. Obviously, investors were PISSED and Netflix plunged 10% on the week. To be fair, that’s what you degenerates get for sharing your Netflix passwords with your friends, y’all deserve this one. During the earnings call, CEO Reed tried to “urge investors to look beyond subscriptions"", as if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. NFLX did announce a healthy share buyback during the call, which is pretty awesome considering they just created a dip to buy. Cathie Wood, and CEO Reed were promptly seen religiously doubling down on their shitty investments.

&nbsp;


- Throughout the week, **random shit was mooning left and right, most notably SKLZ and MVIS**. No news announcements, no earnings reports, no catalyst. Just good ol fashioned market manipulation baby. MVIS saw $10.20 before closing the week up 80% around $18.00, while SKLZ followed closeby seeing $12.50 before closing the week up 50% at $18.50. I was eyeing skillz for weeks at this point but didn’t want to catch the knife until it settled. Ah well, live to trade another day I suppose.

&nbsp;


- On Thursday, the media was back to spreading FUD. According to a report by Bloomberg, **President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6%** to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. **When coupled with the 3.8% tax on investment income that funds the Affordable Care Act, federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%**. For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%. Although this news has already been known for a long ass time, it still tanked the markets 1% on the day. Algos reacting to humans reacting to algos, crazy shit. I can’t help feel like this entire situation was comedic as hell. Rich people make too much money, therefore we wanna increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy then immediately withdraw all money from the stock market and we’re left with retail traders left holding bags. Wealth is transferred from the poor to the rich. Mission accomplished.

&nbsp;


- **To those familiar with the [Lil Yachty Indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0975/lil_yachty_theory_goes_on/), this week was terrifying**. On 4/20, Lil Yachty released a hit single, causing the market to absolutely shit itself. Although the market managed to recover, the stress it caused wasn’t all that welcome, because the song itself was pretty dogshit. On top of all that, on Friday he also announced that he’s dropping a ***WHOLE ASS ALBUM***. Friday was a ripping green day, which is really fucking awesome, cause it means I got to liquid all my positions at an all time high. I hope you all followed suit, cause next week we’re gonna be blood red. Don't believe me? Search up ""Lil Yachty Crashes Stock Market"" on youtube for some definitive proof.

&nbsp;


- **There was a whole bunch of news this week that I didn’t have time to write about, but I encourage you to look into it** later if it interests you! I’ll summarize them all below. The U.K. government said it would probe **Nvidia** Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. Chat startup **Discord** Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including **Microsoft**, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, **Apple** announced a new slate of products set to include the company's own chip. **U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to 547,000** in the latest week, below the 617 estimate and from 586,000 prior week. Continued claims fell to 3.674M vs. the estimated 3.667M.

&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Apologies for the shorter report this time round, I was extremely busy with work this week, and earnings season came with WAY too much additional news. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and come back on Monday rejuvenated for some more trading. Cheers 😎",45881,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.998011827,True
4/23/21 16:58,"Investing with Lil Boat, DD based on the album. Yachty killed the coins when he dropped Michigan Boy Boat and tomorrow he's coming for the SPY. The album is filled with DD. Here's my review:

Track 3 - **Concrete Goonies** \- Invest in infrastructure.

Track 5 - **G.I. Joe** \- Long RTX, LTM, BA, DFEN, NOC. This is an obvious play you shouldn't need Yachty to elucidate for you.

Track 6 - **Never Did Coke** \- This is a short play on KO. Yachty thinks kids are more health conscious now, but his bearish sentiment on Coke long-term confuses me. I think they're well positioned for some CBD beverages and healthy drinks.

Track 8 - **Plastic** \- Long oil. This is a recovery play.

Track 12 - **SB5** \- If you google SB5 you get PROFUTURA. This is a bullish Latina futures play. GPROFUT

Track 13 - **Hybrid** \- He's saying short Tesla, as he prefers a hybrid to a full electric. Yachty is bullish on Detroit automakers. He seems to suggest he's made quite the bag off GM and FORD this year while fucking your little sister.

Overall, Yachty invests like a boomer, which is telling. I agree with some of his observations and will be adjusting my portfolio as needed. I give it a Strong 7 weak 8.",45921,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.962566495,True
4/23/21 01:53,"I ordered a Fisker FSR great play, lying GS DOOSH Analyst $10 PT when BOA $31 LOL these guys are educated? DD  

Balls deep in FSR I just sold 10 $13.50 4/30 puts 1800 shares, 1 $15.00 put expire tomorrow. bought $14.50 4/23 calls super cheap expiring tomorrow too. Going on the website now to order a FISKER OCEAN $250.00 deposit. Nice looking car perfect around town EV , dare i say nicer look then TESLA.

Here is my dummy DD :

PART 1 :

Fisker commisioned MAGMA to build the cars, they have the factory turning out beautys like the Toyota Supra this will get them up and running fast. ( RIDE dropped like a billy on a factory and they still fked) I think using MAGMA is the right way to scale this business.

They can buy a factory later when they have ELON money.

Part 2:

OCEAN 1 with biden tax credits may come in under 30k, thats the sweet spot. ( I think that other high end EV  has tough competition with Mercedes in the Rich people sector) for 30k i think the FISKER OCEAN 1 may become the peoples EV and many's first.

Part 3:

FOXCONN coming up and Henrik is excited and ready to reveal some new stuff maybe another model?? Large full size SUV would knock it out of the park.

Lots to look forward to here. Just my Humble Opinion.

Goldman BallSacks Analyst put a $10 PT on this today after yesterdays epic run up. I think sleezy GS and their buddies are stuck in a short play and have lots of calls sold expiring this week.

4/22/21 06:12,"Blackberry covered calls warning...be careful Be careful with writing covered calls for blackberry. They(institutions and shorts) want you to write these covered call. Total short on stock is about 60 million or 10% of all shares. They realized that blackberry has a monopoly in connected and EV car operating system with Blackberry QNX and IVY, and they also have monopoly in Cybersecurity with Blackberry Spark for protecting critical iot devices (government computers and phones, drones, trafficlight, meter, all smart city infrastructure). This is a very critical monopoly that Blackberry will not admit to yet because Congress will then break them up. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in cybersecurity for IOT?  
If you look at all hacking that happened since December on government and enterprise(30,000 companies), none using Blackberry Spark were impacted!!! After Department of Commerce was hacked they immediately switched to Blackberry Spark. Same with Airforce and Canadian Government.  Crowdstrike will be a joke in coming years. Only blackberry has a zero trust architecture out of all cybersecurity company, and that's why they are able to protect governments from hacks like Solarwind and others can't do it. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in Car EV and Connected Cars?  
The Blackberry QNX software is THE ONLY car operating system authorized for connected cars. This is why every car company is signed up with Blackberry. Even Tesla's component coming from NVDIA uses Blackberry. The NVDIA controller used by Tesla for their autonomous driving is running on QNX. QNX is inherntly the most secure operating system in the world!!! The proof is in contracts from every car company to blackberry. The Rev will be about $50 per car in coming years. The Blackberry IVY will add about $10-$20 recurring revenue per car per year in coming years. 

&#x200B;

So why not write covered calls?  
The institution and hedge funds and shorts will trigger them soon. The Patent sale will be minimum of $15 billion for 25,000 patents. Patent is bread and butter of any company. Chen said ""most patents' that's why i'm thinking he's selling more than 20k patents. $15Billion automatically takes the price to $40!!!!!! overnight!!! you will lose your shares to hedge funds that're short and institutions.",46001,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999584377,True

5/7/21 03:16,"How to cope with RKT losses. Many of you myself included woke up this morning with worthless calls, or a lot of RKT shares down almost 18 percent. 

Rather than posting loss porn or crying about it, here are some things you can do to turn the ship around

1. Diversify - there are several good plays always available. Realize that betting the farm on one good play has the very real chance of turning against you. Myself personally, I hate diversification. I would rather just put all my money into a few companies I trust, sit back, and watch what happens. The current market environment right now however is punishing us for portfolio concentration. You don't have to invest in the SPY to be fully diversified, but it would certainly help to have maybe a pool of 8-12 stocks you really like, and try to at least have a little bit of sector diversification so that when all of tech is down you still have something up.  IE.. I love CRSR, ASO, RKT, and TSLA. If you like all these companies about equally, don't feel like a loser for divvying up your money between them. There is no rule that you have to pick one and live or die by their earnings. 
2. If you hold RKT shares, don't sell. It's still a good company. They had one slightly lower than expected quarter (literally missed by 1 penny on the EPS). It's not the end of the world. Most analysts agree that the stock is still undervalued. Right now people are panic selling and trying to make the shareholders feel miserable. If you bought at 23 then you should hold at 18 and tough it out. **AT THE VERY LEAST - if you no longer want to be a long term shareholder, seriously consider chilling out for a bit and waiting for the stock to revert to the mean**. RKT has solid fundamentals. This isn't MVIS, WKHS, SPCE.
3. Sell covered calls - I would wait 1-2 weeks for the RKT hate to die down. When sentiment is back to ""neutralish"" and the stock has recovered a little bit from the major blow, start selling covered calls to work your way back to cost basis. You might have to keep doing this for a few months but eventually I see RKT going back up to 22-23 range quite easily. RKT is and always has been a great stock to wheel, the earnings report hasn't changed that.

\- LAST, don't lose hope. If you lost all your money on RKT calls, it's okay. I started out in the stock market very little capital. It took me about a year to reach portfolio value of around 40k. I'm down a bit from there, but I'm in this for the long haul. This is your chance to restart using everything you've learned about the stock market to make better decisions. Also.. think about it this way. You paid for those calls or those shares for the OPPORTUNITY but not the GUARANTEE that the shares would go up. Those calls weren’t worthless, you made a calculated bet with the hope/expectation of gain. You can’t be too hard on yourself for at least trying to win.",46105,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.986207366,True

Right now QQQ is trading at 29x Next twelve month's earnings

Earnings shall be revised up & i let you conclude with regard to that 29 number and what that does to QQQ 

Now to adress some questions : **Why are Qs so shit since the earnings ?** 

**I've identified 3 themes let's discuss all of them :**

A) Chips shortage story which is now correctly being identified as an issue with double (and triple) ordering from asian clients - This is a problem for the ""value"" semis (MU & friends) not the super structural growth semis (NVDA & friends, though NVDA has another problem called ARM and AMD another problem called XLNX) - My view on SMH is not really bullish but contrary to what people may think it's not that big a deal for Qs and you can just avoid them if you pick another etf

B) MTUM Rebalancing : Momentum N-12 Type strats are supposed to reduce their tech exposure in favor of banks and such which leads to a lot of HFs trying to front run this move. it's a may thing and should be over very soon

C) the most important one : This idea that a lot of ppl are selling big winners to reduce their tax bill because Biden will probs manage to increase cap gains tax. Due to a lot of reasons which are not important to us in effect, this is more something that some ""smart"" HFs are trying to front run than something which actually exists. This sets them up for a massive squeeze < 17 May

Besides these little quircks QQQ is FAR below where it should be given the EXTREMELY NEW ACCOMODATIVE stance that the FED is giving us and the EXTREMELY GOOD earnings. 

some sellside analysts already have a 5K target for AMZN since the earnings ...

5/10/21 07:35,"A quantitative observation of stock selling activities and corresponding timeframe by CEOs and insiders of successful tech companies. Both IPO and Direct Listed companies I knew that when I posted that DD on $PLTR CEO heavily selling stocks within six months of going public will be challenged strongly but I had no idea about the intensity. The comment section in that post is just sad and a true reflection of the state of the desperation from so many bag holders. They are trying so hard to defend these heavy selling of $PLTR shares by the CEO by weak and laughable logic. You really want to talk about the insider selling? Let’s see what other CEO of successful company did-

**Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos**

Company went public in 1997

stock price was $1.73 at that time.

Bezos sold his 1st batch of shares in 2003, six years after his company went public.

He sold 2.95M shares at price range $28-$49

He did not sell any shares in 1999 when the stock was trading at its ATH of $107

When he sold his 1st share it was over 2800% up from its IPO price

&#x200B;

**Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates**

Company went public in 1986

stock price was $0.11 at that time.

Gates sold his 1st batch of shares in 2003, seventeen years after his company went public.

He sold 22M shares at price range $25-$26

He did not sell any shares in 1999 when the stock was trading at its ATH of $56

When he sold his 1st share it was over 23000% up from its IPO price

&#x200B;

**Tesla CEO Elon Musk**

Company went public in 2010

stock price was $3.84 at that time.

Musk sold his 1st batch of shares in 2010, the same year his company went public.

He sold only 1.41M shares at $3.4

And then he bought back those 1.41M shares in 2011 at $5.75 (paid more than he got from selling them)

After that in 2012 he purchased

1.87M shares at $1.6

35.3K shares at $5.65

88.9K shares at $2.22

In 2013 he purchased

1.08M shares at $18.44

214K shares at $9.3

Then he kept buying shares in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 at even higher price. In 2020 he even purchased 13K shares at $767

He did not sell any shares even when TSLA was trading at $900

The only other time he sold 2.78M shares in 2016 at $42.6

***Now go and look at what Steve Jobs and other CEOs did, you will be very surprised.***

&#x200B;

**CEOs and insiders of other Direct listing companies**

What about **directly listed stocks?** Let’s see-

**$SPOT:** It has been 3 years they went public. No insiders sold a single share till today except Direct TV sold their shares.

**$WORK:** ~~Almost 2 years since they went public. No insiders sold a single share till today.~~ CEO sold about 1.8M shares at different price. First sold 125K shares on 06/08/2020 at $30-$32 one year after company went public

**$RBLX:** CEO David Baszucki sold only 1.3M shares at 67.77

**$COIN:** ~~No insiders sold a single share till today.~~ CEO has not sold any share yet. (Thanks to u/aahsir for pointing this mistake)

People kept saying Alex Karp did not sell much or he needs to pay tax on the options he has been exercising. He got 141M shares from options with an exercise price of $11.38 and these options will expire on August 20, 2032 that is more than 11 years from today. None of these 141M shares are even vested yet. Only 2.5% (3.525M) shares will be vested in August 2021. Now tell me what is so hurry that he kept exercising those options and selling these shares when these options are not expiring in next 10 years?

You do not pay tax on these options until you exercise them. Even if you exercise them you pay only capital gain tax on the profit you make from the difference between the FMV and exercise price. CEOs do not just exercise their options they get from their stock-based compensation 11 years before the options expires. Even if they do, they do not just sell them immediately when the company is still bleeding money and cash negative. You only exercise these options if you think that there is little to no benefit of keeping these options for long time and you can get more money if you exercise them now, even after paying the tax on it.

Some people are saying Karp only getting 1M in salary. Oh boy! You have no idea why a CEO take cash salary less than 1M and take options and stocks worth billion. Karp is taking only 1M salary, but his total compensation is over 1B. That means he is taking a salary in cash that is less than 0.1% of his total compensation. Do you know why? Because that’s the maximum cap that you can deduct fully from your expenses. If his expense is 3M in 2021, he will basically pay $0 income tax on his cash salary. But if his cash salary was 2M and his expenses were 3M then he can deduct only 1M expense but still need to pay income tax on his rest 1M cash salary.

Now if he thinks that $PLTR will be $50 by let’s say Feb 2022, why would he exercise those options now and sell those stocks at $20? Think more and please let me know.

Some people were saying it’s his stocks and it doesn’t matter what he does with his stock. Seriously? You know, this is why people, both from other finance related subs and we ourselves, call us retards. Sometimes it might seem funny but it’s not.

And please do not say that it's a long term investment because people invest on a stock keeping years timeframe in mind do not spend time discussing their investment strategies here. Even when people post showing gains from stock they are being mocked heavily although I dot agree with that kind of feedback. wsb is anything but a long term investment sub. Now some people do pretend to become one when they are left holding bags on a meme stock like PLTR. All these might sound bitter to you who bought PLTR at $35 or even at $40 but that's the truth.

&#x200B;

**TlDr:** What the CEO of $PLTR has been doing in terms of dumping shares is completely opposite of what other CEOs did in past and it’s a big red alert.

I do like Palantir Technologies as a company and I believe that with careful implementation of good business strategies they might become a very successful tech company. But, I do not like $PLTR stock for many reasons such as heavy insider selling, compensation structure of the company top executives and most importantly due to their direct listing. If you observe the price action of other directly listed tickers such as $SPOT and $WORK you will have an idea.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Based on few comments, looks like **I was probably wrong on the tax implication of the options granted** as part of stock based compensation. I need to read more on that specific topic.

I am still bearish as other CEO did not sell that much stocks that soon that frequently. Tax implication was just one point and I was wrong on that one, I agree. But, **stock options as part of a compensation are not subject to 1 million cap and can be deducted 100% value of those options**. In fact this is one reason CEOs take less salary (subject to 1M cap), less bonuses (subject to 1M cap), less RSUs(subject to 1M cap) and more stock options.",46372,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999612629,True

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities.

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

1. Losses per share well beat expectations for the quarter. Projection was -$0.46 and they [actually](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nkla/earnings) lost -$0.31/share.....still losing money, but not as fast
2.

3. Nikola has a [LOI](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-iveco-and-oge-announce-intent-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-hydrogen-infrastructure-and-fueling-solutions-116) with some Germans to eat Schnitzel and create a hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure in Europe. This is a big deal because Germany is ([maybe](https://electrek.co/2016/06/14/all-new-cars-mandated-electric-germany-2030/)) going all electric by 2030 and Nikola could be a major winner on the logistics front. Once in Germany (The largest economy in Europe), it will more easily branch to the rest of the EU.

Yes yes, soon after everything else went to shit and TSLA got fucked even harder. With all the shit that's happened this year with short squeezes, I suspect that shorts are just a tiny bit more hesitant about disclosing their positions.

**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

*“With the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,” the UBS report said.*

*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain’s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .""*

How Tesla is quietly expanding its energy storage business
Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in 2015 that the electric-vehicle company would be getting into the energy business. Now, it's starting to take off. On its Q4 2020 earnings call, the company said its battery deployments increased 83% in 2020, particularly thanks to the popularity of the Megapack, which stores energy for utilities.
Renewable energy such as solar and wind need battery storage for when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. As nations around the world set goals to transition to renewables, demand for these large-scale storage systems is on the rise. Grid-scale battery storage is expected to become a $15 billion market by 2027, according to Grand View Research.
CNBC visited PG&E's Tesla Megapack site in Moss Landing, California, and learned why energy storage systems like Tesla's could be everywhere in a future of renewable power. Watch the video for a look inside Tesla's energy business",47501,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999496698,True
5/31/21 15:01,"People are missing the point on Burry's $534m Tesla short People don't see the full idea behind Michael Burry's TSLA short. Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.

He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.

Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.

It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.

So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

TL;DR:

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).",47520,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999511361,True

5/28/21 11:03,"Tesla might be a bad future investment. (long read)  

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below.",47683,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.992672384,True

5/27/21 07:23,"A Deep Fucking Value: Why BB is More Than Just a Short Squeeze; And Why It’s Worth $100 A Share First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

The worst has already come. As with many start-ups, RIDE announced they would run out of money by end of year (very common for start-ups to raise 6 months out from end of cash burn) but they'd still be beginning production in September.

As per Forbes, the short interest is over 31%, with plenty of people betting this company is over.

I don't think it's over. The company is backed by GM, announced they're raising a new equity round, and they're going to be part of the future of EV's in the United States along with Tesla. Just like CLOV / GME they're targeted by short sellers, with Hindenburg writing a short memo just like they did on CLOV (and we all remember Citron on GME lol).

Also, thanks to u/kazaii21 :

Once this company announces their new equity backer, this thing could really pop. It's the future of EV's in America.

From the very beginning, Canoo vehicles were designed in such a way as to easily accommodate autonomous technology such as LiDAR.

Kranz knows the Canoo vehicles inside and out better than anyone else, now he will have full access to the Apple autonomous program.

My speculation is that with Kranz at Apple, this could make the perfect match to make Canoo vehicles autonomous equipped at launch and compete directly with Tesla.

6/11/21 05:07,"$TSLA - BIGGEST PROFIT OPPORTUNITY ON TSLA THIS ALL 2021 I'm going to be quick but clear about what's up, it's a lot of numbers so I TLDR'd.

1. Falling wedge on the annual graph for TSLA, we're compressed and ready to go in either direction. Not good enough. Which direction? 

2. There are 881,441 calls written between now and the 10th of next month and 1,026,076 puts. 88%ish I didn't bother to get perfect %s. 

3. The distribution of the top 10 highest volume contracts from this window of time is 88% bullish compared to where we're at today, i.e. MMs don't wanna get assigned at 645 upward to 700-ish between now and mid-July. The 40% which are bearish are at current levels, lowest is 600. All of this makes sense for a wedge and out of 10, it's basically 20/80, let's just forget the 8% left over... so we need to get clusters from the top 10.

4. Of the 60% which are bullish 33% of them are in the top 3. Top **6** is 60% bullish. 75% of bearish writes are in the bottom 30% of the top 10 highest volume calls.

__**All of this combined tilts $TSLA about 1% toward the bullish direction for a massive breakout between now and the end of July.**__

If you want to believe $TSLA follows any kind of rules, there is also this that makes it maybe 55% bullish on calls.

`In Kirkpatrick and Dalquist's Technical Analysis, they write that the failure rate for the falling wedge is considerably low. The failure rate for an upwards breakout is only 8% – 11%. The rarer breakout lower has a much higher failure rate of 15% – 24%`

6/10/21 07:00,"$NIO has primed it's fundamentals. Steady growth on the horizon. Hello fellow apes. I wanted to bring you one of my old show horses $NIO. As well as let you know that this auto maker is primed for a decent run in the mid-to-long-term. I've been playing them since their IPO. I hope these links are acceptable and can remove as needed.

One quick note I like to repeat to others is NIO has first place wins in the EV F-1 racing scene having the fastest times in the opening seasons. 

This means to me:
1)  They know how to build and manage power supplies.
2)They know how to build high performance EV drive trains
3) They know how to build high performance EV engines.

Now on to the discussion

Back in November 2019 NIO had reached a government backed deal to provide them with 2-5 billions in savings to manufacture at a factory in their Heife region. 

While NIO was managing the build of a new factory equipment they were able to ramp up production of their current model vehicle the ES6. Continuously hitting their production guidance released in their earnings calls. 

NIO then announced in January 2021 that they wanted to produce a more affordable sedan to compete with Tesla. In comes the ET7 this vehicle is slated to be produced at their new factory. To date I haven't seen any news that indicates they've hit a snag (5 day halt did occur) in building out the production capacity at the new facility. They released deal in May 2021 to produce 240,000 per year. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-extends-joint-manufacturing-agreement-090009258.html

This model vehicle will be their mainstream vehicle and it's planned to hit the road in the coming year. 

They've already expanded into the hottest market in EU for EVs Norway.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/nio-plans-to-start-delivering-cars-to-norway-in-september.html

https://www.nio.com/news/nio-announces-norway-strategy

Now that's all production and management of their vehicles. 

But what about the interior and software?!?!? 

Well they've done something a little out there but apparently the consumers are enjoying it they integrated an automotive assistant which is AI driven. This might be something that changes the relationship with owners and the vehicle causing them to hold the vehicle longer instead of reselling on secondary markets. Which drives the demand for new vehicles that they produce.

https://twitter.com/NIOGlobal/status/1394334686025961477?s=19

They also have NIO Navigate on Pilot 1.0 this is the same as Tesla Autopilot with the same suite of features. There's plenty of videos showing that this AI driven software is functioning as designed. This also indicates they aren't behind Tesla but right in step with them.

https://youtu.be/1UaGjztOi94

ONE NOTE about NIO Navigate on Pilot. They said they'd be working on an update but it has not hit the road. So this indicates to me that they're struggling with something to make it to the next phase. Once they release an update they'll be a leader in self driving vehicles in the largest EV market. 

Now just wait THERE'S MOAR! Geez... I'm running out of breath 🫁💨

They have a battery swap service that solves one issue that other EVs have. Super long lines and long charge times. They can swap your battery in their vehicle in 3minutes. 3min and you're back in the road that's as good as gas station times. 

They also released news on a solid state battery which has it's own combustion suppression properties that existing battery technologies suffer from. Google battery fires for four hours on Tesla. 

Some fundamentals:

They've reduced operating costs significantly last quarter.

They've increased margin on their existing vehicle
 https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-third-quarter-2020

They've increased sales month to month and year over year.

They've increased their revenue. 

So what say you? Is this a dieing company? NO

Is this company primed for success, yes! Will they keep up with the major autonomous vehicle players absolutely. Yes!


Two Last points 

1)They are listed on the Chinese companies in Congress for delisting THEY absolutely plan to stay in compliance to stay on the US exchange.

2) they are very active with news, and guidance so it's easy to stay up to date and allow you to reanalyze frequently what's good for your play.",49051,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999535918,True

6/16/21 00:39,"$NIO is worth looking in to! (DD) TLDR:  Nio has great potential, and great tech. however the only things to look out for are financial performance and possible share dilution! 

However I recommend you read this analysis!

I am sure you all have heard of a Chinese Electric Vehicle manufacturer that goes by the name [$NIO – NIO Inc.,](https://utradea.com/stocks/NIO) and I am sure that you have heard them been called the “Tesla of China” but this title is very deceiving and gives the impression that Nio perhaps copied [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA). However, this is false because Nio has a completely different business model and very different technology (especially in their swappable batteries) than Tesla does. Nio is up nearly 1000% on the year, so I decided to do an analysis to find out what all the hype was about and if this hype can be justified.

**Company Overview:**

Nio is a leading manufacturer of premium, smart, electric vehicles. Nio designs, develops, manufactures, and sells their vehicles to their main customer base in China. Furthermore, Nio is constantly looking to improve upon their autonomous driving, digital technology, battery technology and their powertrains, in order to differentiate themselves from their competition.

Nio has industry-leading battery swapping technology, which drives their battery as a service (BaaS) business. Additionally, Nio also has proprietary autonomous driving technology, which enables their Autonomous Driving as a Service (ADaaS) business.

Nio currently sells their vehicles in China, however they are planning on expanding their business into international markets, to capitalize on the growing demand for EV’s. Nio has 4 vehicle models, their ES8, ES6, EC6, and their ET7.

**Investment Information:**

*Vehicle Offerings:*

· **ES8** is a 6-7 seat premium electric SUV that features 2 induction motors (240 kW). The ES8 accelerated from 0-100 kph in 4.4 seconds and is ranked 5 stars by the C-NCAP (Chinese New Car Assessment Program) for their safety standards. Lastly, the ES8 can go roughly 355 km on a single charge. IN 2020, Nio sold 10,861 of their ES8 models.

· **ES6** is a 5-seat high-performance SUV that features one magnet motor (160 kW) and one induction motor (240 kW). The ES6 can accelerate from 0-100 kph in 4.7 seconds and can reach up to 430km on a single charge. In 2020, Nio sold 27,945 of their ES6 models.

· **EC6** is a Coupe SUV that features one (160 kW) magnet motor, and a (240 kW) Induction motor. The EC6 is capable of accelerating from 0-100 kph in 4.5 seconds, and it can go 440 km (70 kWh battery) to 615 km (100 kWh battery) on a single charge. The EC6 also features a 2.1 square meter panoramic glass roof. In 2020, Nio sold a total of 4,922 of their EC6 models, basically just in Q4 alone (16 were sold in Q3 and none in Q1/Q2).

· **ET7** is a Sedan that offers 1 front magnet motor (180 kW), and one back Induction motor (300 kW). The ET7 is very aerodynamic and can accelerate from 0-100 kph in a mere 3.9 seconds. The ET7 has 5-star safety ratings from both Chinese and European Assessment Programs. The ET7 also features their computing system (Adam) and super sensing system (Aquila). This vehicle is said to be able to reach distances of 1000 km on a single charge (with their 150-kWh battery).

*Battery Swapping (BaaS):*

Nio’s battery swapping technology is supported by over 1,200 patents and this technology is supported on all of Nio’s vehicles. This technology provides Nio customers with the convenience of quickly swapping their battery for another one to continue their journey quicker through a seamless recharge.

Nio is releasing their Power Swap Station 2.0 in 2021, which will decrease their swap time to roughly 3 minutes and have the capacity for 13 rotational battery packs. In 2020, Nio had 172 Swapping Stations in 74 cities that swapped 1.4 million batteries.

Nio’s Battery as a Service business generates revenue through “battery subscriptions”, in which users have flexible subscription options that they can choose to fit their battery swapping needs. Currently, Nio has several subscriptions for both their 70 kWh, and their 100 kWh batteries.

If a customer were to select the 70-kWh subscription, they would enjoy approximately $11,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of approximately $150 (USD).

If a customer selects the 100-kWh subscription plan, they will enjoy approximately $20,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of $231 (USD).

*Autonomous Driving (ADaaS):*

Nio has worked on their autonomous technology since day one and now delivers their products that come with “Nio Pilot”, their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Furthermore, Nio is about to roll out their Nio Autonomous driving (NAD).

Consisting of 23 sensors, a front-facing tri-focal camera, 4 exterior cameras, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and an interior driver-monitoring camera, **Nio Pilot** is Chinas only ADAS that is on the market. [Nio Pilot](https://www.nio.com/news/new-nio-pilot-option-packs-and-navigation-pilot-2020) has fleet learning and AI analysis capabilities that will be able to update their cars over the clous and improve their algorithms using their extensive backlog of driving data.

In January 2021, Nio announced [their Autonomous Driving capabilities (NAD)](https://www.nio.com/nad). The NAD system was developed in-house and features perception algorithms, localization, control strategy software, and platform software. The NAD technology uses their super computing platform “Adam”, and their super sensing system “Aquila”.

Nio is planning to roll out their NAD to their customers, through a subscription model similar to their battery sapping service. This subscription is estimated to cost users $106 (USD) per month.

*Electric Powertrain:*

Nio has developed, designed, and manufactured their own proprietary electric powertrains in house since their inception. Nio makes powertrains that are specific to their vehicles, and through their Firmware over-the-air (FOTA) Nio is able to continually improve, update, and adjust their cars to fit the behaviour of their driver.

Nio has greatly improved their motors moving from their 240-kW 2nd generation induction motor to their 300-kW 3rd generation induction motor. Additionally, Nio has improved their magnet motors from 160 kW (2nd gen.) to 180 kW (3rd gen.)

It is this constant drive to keep improving their technology that will help separate Nio from their competitors and help Nio to become one of the best EV manufacturers.

*Battery:*

Nio is very committed to R&D and innovating their battery technology. Currently, Nio offers two battery options: their 70-kWh battery, and their 100-kWh battery.

Their 70-kWh battery is designed, developed and manufactured in-house, and combines Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) NCM prismatic cells, liquid cooling systems and intelligent battery management systems.

Their proprietary and patented 100-kWh battery features thermal propagation prevention, climate thermal management, and bi-directional cloud Building Management Systems (BMS).

Nio has also [announced their 150-kWh battery](https://insideevs.com/news/465188/nio-150-kwh-solid-state-batteries-2022/) which is expected to release in Q4 2022, or Q1 2023, which is another large innovation to their existing technology and proves their determination to be the most innovative.

*Intellectual Property:*

Nio has developed a number of proprietary technologies throughout their business journey. Nio relies on their ability to protect their technologies and property through the use of patents, patent applications, NDA’s, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses.

Nio currently has 2,654 patents that have been approved, 1,397 patents that are in the application process, 3,373 registered trademarks, 804 trademark applications, 133 copyrights, and 686 registered domain names.

*Financial information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Vehicle sales are up by 106.08% YoY, and their cost of sales is only up by 63.72%, which means that their margins are improving. This year was Nio’s first year having a gross profit, which equalled $287M (USD). Their SG&A expenses decreased by 27.88% YoY, which is good and helps their margins. Lastly, Nio decreased their operating loss by 58.42% which shows that they are making their way towards profitability, which would be a huge milestone.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** R&D expense decreased by 43.82% YoY. While this usually is a good sign, R&D is important to Nio’s business model and future successes, so I would like this figure to be higher. Although Nio decreased their operating losses, they still reported a $706M operating loss (USD) and a $813M net loss, this is not favourable for investors and might scare away potential investors.

· **Stock Incentive Plan:** Nio’s stock incentive plan was designed to attract and retain the best possible personnel to promote the success of Nio’s business. Under their 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 stock plans, there are currently 79.32M shares outstanding, that have yet to have been granted. If all of these outstanding shares were to be granted, it would cause dilutionary effects of roughly 6.45%.

· **Share Options:** As of December 31st, 2020, there are 32.5M common shares available in options that are yet to be exercised (and converted into common shares). If these options were to be exercised, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 2.6%.

· **Restricted Shares Outstanding:** Currently, there are 1,735,744 shares outstanding that are classified as “restricted”, these shares will be vested gradually over a period of time, these shares have a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. If these shares were put on the market today it would cause dilutionary effects of 0.14% over 3.6 years, which is essentially negligible.

*Management Team:*

One of the most important aspects of high-growth stocks is the management team that is heading the company. We have seen awful management teams destroy promising stocks over and over again, so it important to know the management team, their experience, and their track record(s). With that being said, lets dive into Nio’s management team.

· **Bin Li (CEO & Chairman):** Mr. Li founded and served as the director for Beijing Bitauto E-commerce Co. from 2000-2006. After that, Mr. Li served as the chairman of the board of Bitauto Holdings. (Formerly listed on the NYSE. Mr. Li has also been named as one of the top 10 most influential/distinguishable people in China’s automotive industry by CADA in 2008. As we can see Mr. Li has a history in the automotive space and is a distinguished person in the space as well, which can help vouch for his credibility.

· **Lihong Qin (President & Director):** Prior to Nio, Mr. Qin was the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Director at Longfor Properties Co. from 2008-2014. Mr. Qin also served as a Senior Consultant and Deputy GM of Anhui Chery Automobile Sales and Service Company form 2005-2008. Mr. Qin has both a background in the Auto Industry (though Anhui Chery) and in the field of management (through Longfor Properties).

· **Feng Shen (Executive VP):** Mr. Shen worked in several executive management roles prior to working at Nio. Mr. Shen was the President and Chief Technology Officer at Polestar China, President and VP at Volvo Cars China and Volvo Asia-Pacific, Chairman at China-Sweden Traffic Safety Research Center from 2010-2017. Prior to this he worked at Ford Motor Company as a Powertrain manager. Mr. Shen has extensive experience in both the management space (Polestar and China-Sweden Traffic), and the automotive industry (Ford, and Volvo).

· **Xin Zhou (Executive VP):** Mr. Zhou served as the Executive Director at Qoros Automotive C. from 2009-2015, and prior to this was the Engagement Manager at McKinsey Co. from 2007-2009. Mr. Zhou has experience in both the Automotive Industry, as well as in management positions, and his experience will be an asset for Nio in the future.

· **Wei Feng (CFO):** Mr. Feng was previously the Managing Director and Head of the auto/auto parts research team at China International Capital Corp. from 2013-2019. Prior to this he was an industry analyst at Everbright Securities from 2010-2013. Mr.Feng has great experience in the financial industry, and has focused on the auto industry and researching the industry.

· **Ganesh Iyer (Chief Information Officer):** Mr.Iyer has over 32 years of experience In the autonomous technology, hi-tech, manufacturing, and telecom industries. Mr. Iyer was previously the VP of IT at Tesla from 2012-2016 and was the Senior IT roles at VMWare from 2010-2012. Mr. Iyer has plenty of experience that will help him to drive the future progression/growth at Nio.

**Investment Valuation:**

The only way in which I could value Nio is through a set of comparable analyses. These analyses will compare some of Nio’s financial ratio’s/multiples to that of their competitors.

*Comparable Analysis #1:*

In this comparable I compared Nio’s financial ratios to that of [$TSLA – Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA), [$XPEV – Xpeng](https://utradea.com/stocks/XPEV), and [$LI – Li Auto](https://utradea.com/stocks/LI).

*EV/Assets:*

When comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to that of their competitors (as listed above), I found that Nio has a fair value of $257.66, which wouldimply a share price increase of 453.39%. This is very optimistic, so I decided to undergo more comparables to find out if this result was consistent.

*EV/Revenue:*

By Comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (excluding Xpeng because their ratio was not positive), I found that Nio is $196.70, which implies an increase in value of 322.47%. This is quite similar and consistent with the results achieved in the EV/Assets comparable, so I decided to do one last comparable to gain more insight.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $45.19 per share, which would imply a downside risk of 2.94%. This is inconstant with the other 2 results, so I decided to average the results achieved by each comparable to reach an unbiased valuation.

*Average Comparable #1:*

By taking the average of all 3 comparable that I underwent in this analysis I arrived at a final all-encompassing price target of $166.51, which would imply a price increase of 257.62%.

*Comparable #2:*

I decided to undergo a second comparable to factor out the influence of Tesla on the results of my first comparable. I did this for a variety of reasons, which include Tesla being valued so much higher than the other EV comparable companies, Tesla being the only company located outside of China (this is because Chinese companies tend to be undervalued, so taking the comparable for these solely Chinese companies makes more sense), and these other companies pose more of a threat to Nio given their ***current*** geographical reach.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to XPeng and Li Auto, I found that Nio’s fair value is approximately $51.64, which would imply a share price increase of 10.91%. this is very reasonable, however I decided to undergo the other comparable to either validate or invalidate this result.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to Li Auto (because XPeng does not have a positive EV/Revenue multiple), I arrived at a fair value of Nio of $52.00, which would imply an upside of 11.68%. Once again, this is very reasonable and constant with the result from the EV/Assets comparable.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B multiple to their Chinese competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $37.46, which implies a downside risk of 19.54%. This is not consistent with the results achieved in the previous 2 analyses, and as a result of this I decided to average my results to achieve an unbiased fair value.

*Average Comparable #2:*

By taking the average of the fair values that I achieved in the 2nd comparable analysis (w/o Tesla), I achieved one all-encompassing fair value of $47.03, which implies an upside of 1.07%, meaning that Nio is approximately at fair value in comparison to their Chinese competitors.

*My Thoughts:*

I think the fact that Nio is undervalued when comparing them to their Chinese competitors is very good for the stock. I believe that Nio should be overvalued compared to them because Nio presents a larger upside. The fact that Nio is undervalued is very bullish, and when incorporating Tesla is extremely bullish. I think the comparable with Tesla will be more applicable when Nio starts to expand their operations internationally, as they will likely start to be valued as less of a “Chinese stock” and more of a legitimate EV company.

I think that investors need to keep up to date with Nio’s financial reports to make sure that they are on the right track, since here is no way to do a proper DCF right now. But other than this, Nio is looking very bullish.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Nio has multiple different streams of possible dilution that will negatively affect their shares price, these streams consist of Nio’s Share Incentive Plan, Stock Options, and Restricted Stock Units. All of these streasm would combine to make a total dilutionary effect of roughly 9.19%, which is not bad. Typically, high growth stocks have large amounts of dilution, and some of Nio’s dilution is spread over 3 years, so I do not see this being a huge risk, although it is worth keeping in mind.

· **Financial Performance**: Nio reported an operating loss and net loss of $706M and $813M respectively, this level of loss is not great to see as investors however they are making moves toward profitability which is good to see. Furthermore, Nio almost cut their R&D spending by ½, which is not favourable in my eyes because I would rather Nio spend the extra money to further develop their technologies and be the most technologically advanced EV maker in China/the World.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Nio exhibited great growth YOY, while keeping the cost of sales growth significantly lower than their revenue growth. Furthermore, Nio reported a gross profit for the first time and decreased their operating losses significantly. If Nio can continue to improve their financial reports/position, and become profitable in the near future, then this will serve as a huge catalyst for Nio.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Social Sentiment Tracker](https://utradea.com/feed), Nio is currently the 20th, 16th, and 18th most trending stock om Reddit in the past 4, 24, and 48 hours respectively, with an overall positive sentiment. As we know Reddit can have beneficial impacts on stocks that they target and is important to keep in mind as a current/future investor.

· **Technology:** Nio has been consistently improving upon their technology, moving from their 1st to 2nd, and now to their 3rd generation of Electric Powertrains. Nio has consistently been improving their motors (both magnet and induction) to futher the technology of their EV’s and offer superior range. Furthermore, Nio is set to release their 150-kWh battery in late 2022, this battery is expected to have a range of 1000km, if this is true they will have the longest range of any EV by a long shot, which will help show Nio’s superior technology.

As you can imagine, this analysis too a lot of time for me to put together, so I would greatly appreciate it if you [follow me](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale?utm_source=R&utm_medium=B&utm_campaign=NIO) to read my previous posts nd stay up-to-date on my new posts!

6/18/21 01:13,"CLOV FUNDAMENTAL🚀 CLOV is my next TSLA

The daily suppression and manipulation of CLOV by the hedges is well known, and there are plenty of DD’s on why CLOV will surpass $50-150+ in the short-midterm. However, I’m not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.

**TL;DR - First, intro - they’re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they’re growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**

**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**

Have you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can’t figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: “Let’s do another test. I’ll refer you to…” It seems like you’re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn’t familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they’ve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it’s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.

Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.

**15% Concentrated Power of Will**

Clover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they’re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla’s AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.

**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**

Last week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd’s claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it’s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.

In spite of the evidence of growth, you’ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV’s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it’s not just a regular health insurance company, it’s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)

Circling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It’s because they’re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla’s time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn’t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** 

If the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn’t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they’re not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they’re looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn’t a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you’ll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.

*""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""* 

* Warren Buffett

**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**

Like I said before, I’m not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y’all have been following Chamath as I have, you’ll know he's known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn’t deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.

I’ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that’s been shared.

*“So when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here’s what I see in a nutshell: Number one… is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I’ve ever made. It’s a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.”*

6/17/21 13:08,"$XPEV DD - A True EV/AV Company In the EV Market, there are an increasing number of players vying for market share, so how is one to know which is the company to own if they wanted to consider investing?
 
The answer is simply....research. And today, I'd like to share some of my own thoughts based on the research I have done to date.
 
1. Tesla has arguably been the King in the EV Space for some time now and minted some individuals a tidy profit if they stuck with the company through thick and thin. Being first in this space from a mass production standpoint, has worked well for them. However the crown is starting to tarnish. 
There are quality concerns, and recently the Model 3 lost Consumer Reports Top Pick Status and IIHS Safety Award after stripping features. Safety concerns with the Model 3 is a big PR problem especially in the world's largest market...China. 

China is also worried about government employees owning Teslas due to perceived security concerns with surveillance. 

One also must acknowledge that Tesla makes its money, not from selling cars, but from the ""regulatory credits"" it gets from governments around the world in their push to reduce carbon emissions. Since Tesla only sells electric vehicles, they get these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other auto manufacturers who can't meet environmental targets. It's big $ for Tesla, but what one cannot look away from is the fact that Tesla IS NOT profitable from selling its cars. At least, not yet.

2. Now on to Chinese Car manufacturers...and there are quite a few. The big names are Buffet-loved and held, BYD. Li Auto which is relatively new, NIO which has some similar roots to Xpeng Motors, but isn't the same. All mentioned here are true EV plays.

Xpeng/Tesla, and the race to autonomous driving. 

3. Autonomous Vehicles is truly the next play in this market and a necessary move for vehicles to go in. Removing driver error is huge for safety and will save insurance companies a TON of money. And in the AV space, the race is between Tesla and Xpeng.

4. Not long ago, Musk charged Xpeng for stealing proprietary tech after a senior engineer left Tesla to join the Xpeng Team. Same was said about a senior Apple engineer who left Apple's Car R&D division and joined Xpeng as well. Tesla sued the engineer and the linchpin was on the AV tech housed in Xpeng's XPILOT software. Tesla argued that their tech was in their software. 
In the end, both companies agreed to allow an independent tech arbitrator to view both company's AV source code, and guess what....it was proven that both Tesla and Xpeng have their own source codes that were designed by their own R&D efforts, and nothing was stolen or was being shared. That was BIG News!!

5. Xpeng in the quest toward Phase 5 self driving cars, liked the safety and accuracy that LiDar tech provides. Musk, on the other hand, scoffed at LiDar for years calling it a 'fool's' play. However, years later, Musk is now conceding there is something to LiDar and may even be developing with it.

But here is the rub, Xpeng has it, is using it, and their software works very very well with all the various sensors combined. Their new model, the P5, was showcased at the Shanghai Auto Show, complete with LiDar, and that show gave Xpeng 10,000 pre orders on reveal day alone. I can only imagine how that number has grown since, and in October, deliveries begin.

6. Xpeng has a new manufacturing facility set to go online in December of this year which will ramp up the ability to produce more cars. In 2022, they also have plans for 2-3 new models, one of which will be a new SUV type.

7. In the race toward full autonomous vehicle capabilities, Xpeng is targeting 2025 as the year for this to be fully operational, safe and complete. That said, they are logging thousands upon thousands of accident free XPILOT driver assisting kilometers with their cars doing a lot of the driving without needing help from the driver. No sleeping behind the wheel yet, but they are charting a significant course towards getting this done!

Tesla? Well...when was the last time you heard of an accident or life lost? Probably not long ago, so they still have  a long ways to go I think, and now Musk is backpeddling on his timelines for full AV capabilities. 

SCALE 

8. Like China or not, with the GREEN push throughout the world and everything drivable going electric, there really is only ONE country that can help to meet the demand...China. They are a manufacturing powerhouse, and Xpeng is ramping up to get the world and humanity, the cars they need.

SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE

9. A big hope for Tesla is that they can sell the software for their cars to have the capabilities they “can"" have. You want software assisted driving? That’s going to cost you like 4 grand as an option. It’s smart, if it works well.
Xpeng has a similar hope, but is really successful already in this strategy. They also deploy OTA upgrades on what seems to be a weekly basis almost, which is exciting like when your phone gets an Over-the-Air update and new features, that same excitement is happening with XPeng’s car owners, and it is translating into more sales. 

And while we are on the topic of sales, you can’t help but notice that Xpeng was the first Chinese EV Car company to start selling vehicles in Europe in Norway, and plan to expand their distribution in more parts of Europe before the year is over. 

In Conclusion...
 
Xpeng is an impressive company with huge goals for itself and they make technologically superior vehicles from many different angles. Entertainment, Drivability, Safety, Comfort, etc.
 
I remember reading a quote of a comment that He Xiaopeng (Xpeng CEO and Founder) said to Musk, and it went something like this...""We will destroy you in China, and we will be an absolute nuisance to you in Europe,"" and I think it won't be long, if not already, that He Xiaopeng lives up to his statement. 
 
Xpeng is worth a serious look and currently has price targets north of $50 USD. A great opportunity for a company of purchasing value today. Do your own research and I think you will come to see the true Tesla competitor, if not successor!

6/17/21 08:45,"I think after I'm done with donkey Kong's $DKNG IMA PUT IT ALL INTO TESLA lmk what u think Shares of Tesla closed lower despite a strong call from Mizuho.

Analysts at the firm reiterated their buy rating on the stock, citing the company's leadership in the global electric vehicle market and expecting the stock to get a boost from the Biden administration's proposed infrastructure plan. 


Michael Bapis, managing director of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management, told CNBC on Tuesday that Tesla's roughly 24% market share and ambitions in the electric vehicle, space and clean energy markets make it a name worth watching.

""Tesla is going to continue to be the leader in the industry, especially for the foreseeable future,"" Bapis said on ""Trading Nation."" ""When you think Tesla, you think innovation.""

He expects the company to keep delivering strong sales and earnings growth, which he said could raise demand for the stock.

""If you look at some of these institutional funds ... and they don't have this stock in there, they're definitely going to get questioned why,"" he said.

Although Tesla did run up ""too far, too fast"" last year as people piled into the stock, Bapis said now is a great time to buy the dip.


""Unless someone comes in and breaks through the difficult barriers to entry, you're going to see this stock grow long term,"" he said. ""Any time you get the chance to buy it, buy it.""

He added that although its supply chain has been riddled with delays and shortages, Tesla was a strong long-term buy considering its fundamentals and growth potential. 

""I think it's the time to buy it right now and just put it away,"" he said. ""Close your eyes on the volatility for a little bit and bet on the fundamentals and the leadership of the company. I mean, you can't get a better leader than they have.""

In the same ""Trading Nation"" interview, Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, noted that Tesla's stock has been relatively flat for the past several months, trading around its 200-day moving average.

infographic
""You don't see that very often,"" he said. ""Whichever way it breaks away from that 200-day moving average will give us a little bit of a hint [about] its next move.""

The stock is also forming a descending triangle pattern, Maley said, saying the upper end of the pattern is around $650 and the lower end sits at $563. Those are the two levels to watch, and where shares move relative to those levels will be very indicative of where Tesla is headed, he said.

""In the past, when the stock has been stuck in this sideways range, once it breaks out, it starts to move in a big way. This should be no different,"" he said.

Tesla's deliveries report in the first week of July could be a breakout catalyst, Maley said.

Disclosure: Bapis's family and Vios Advisors own shares of Tesla.

[Jerome Guillen Was Second In Command at Tesla and Left unexpectedly Last Week](https://preview.redd.it/yzmo64vrzo571.png?width=1841&format=png&auto=webp&s=6abe7f5e0a4e8b3dbb08635a42c142165d804436)

TLDR - **Tesla number 2 guy stepped down days before RIDE CEO Quit - Is he Coming to the Start Up?**

Current Position - **I own 100 long on $10 Oct strike calls and 2 common shares of stock** 

Last week, Jerome Guillen shocked the auto world by announcing his depature from Tesla. He was the second in command at the auto giant starting there in 2010 and his current role was the head of their truck division. While that took place, behind the scenes at Lordstown Motors another shakeup was underway and the company dropped a bomb that CEO and founder Steve Burns would be stepping down from his position along with CFO Julio Rodriguez. Guillen was the Tesla Model S Program Director and most likely had day to day interaction with Lordstown Motors President Rich Schmidt who was in charge of production and tooling for that project.

Did our partner GM persuade Guillen that this an oppertunity too good to pass up. With the Endurance trucks coming off the line in just a few months now and a shiny brand new battery plant being complete in the coming months from LG and GM partnership the time would be now to get in. His experiene with ramping up the gigafactory probably has GM salivating at his exeprtise helping to help with input on how to maximize the potential there. And you may wonder why Tesla would open for him to jump to a competitor which is reasonable but they probably want to be friendly to GM who will be helping their own supply line with the battery plant coming online.

With productiion so close, I would think that LMC fills this posistion and the timing of Guillen's departure from Tesla and Burns resigination at LMC I think there is a good chance we have some Tesla blood coming to Northeast Ohio which would send shockwaves throughout the auto world.",49408,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.994077086,True
6/17/21 07:10,"$RIDE or Die - $20 by July 🚀 🚀 🚀 **Disclosure: $RIDE is a 2-3 bagger by September. I believe it will double by the end of July.**
 
 
For those unaware, [$WKHS has a 10% stake in $RIDE](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/), so $WKHS will benefit greatly as $RIDE climbs. Additionally, if $WKHS were to get a [piece of the USPS contract to build their delivery vehicles](https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh), the trucks would be built at $RIDE’s facility, so both stocks would continue to jump. My preference of the two is $RIDE, as it gives you backdoor exposure to $WKHS through their 10% stake. I also believe $RIDE has many more short-term catalysts.
 
After all, on Tuesday 6/15, the $RIDE President (who was a former Tesla executive) said $RIDE is willing and able to build Postal Vehicles (in conjunction with $WKHS). $RIDE is also rumored to be talking to other Tesla executives as potential CEO candidates.
 
[$RIDE’s short % of float is ~32%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIDE/short-interest/), and I have seen other sources that claim it is as high as 35%. I have not seen a company with more upcoming catalysts than $RIDE with this high of a short interest. I’ve noticed a huge jump in OI for 7/16 $20 calls and many other calls expiring on 7/16. 🚀 🚀 🚀
 
$RIDE also has billions in assets, around $500m in cash, and 0 debt. They are currently in talks with strategic investors and the Dept of Energy ATVM loan program (same loan that Tesla got as a start-up) to obtain more cash and ramp up commercial production. In their current cash state, they can begin production and produce ~ 20,000 vehicles by next May, but a loan or strategic investor would accelerate/increase commercial production.
 
 
**RIDE – Overview, Tech, and Batteries**
 
RIDE is currently ramping up for mass-production of their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). With the backing of GM along with their automotive plant, RIDE believes their [facility will be able to produce up to 600,000 vehicles each year](https://www.carscoops.com/2020/05/lordstown-motors-ceo-thinks-ev-startup-can-build-600000-vehicles-a-year/) at max capacity. They have the 3rd largest automotive factory in the US which is vertically integrated with robots welding vehicles and will soon have the 2nd largest battery assembly plant in the US.
 
Additionally, RIDE signed a [multi-year supplier agreement with LG Energy Solution](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors%27%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.), “a global leader in battery cell technology, to broaden their high-quality, diverse battery cell supply chain.” It’s also worth noting that [GM and LG are building a battery plant less than a mile away from RIDE’s facility](https://businessjournaldaily.com/gm-lg-chem-select-lordstown-site-for-plant/), which will help them with any supply chain bottlenecks from a battery perspective.

 
**Growth Potential for RIDE 🚀 🚀 🚀**
 
The simplistic approach RIDE took with their [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all) will allow them to create several vehicles using the same skateboard, including their Endurance truck, an ERV, an SUV, Postal Vehicles, etc. 

RIDE also announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a leader in the fleet industry that currently has over 2 million vehicles under management. In addition, RIDE mentioned they have seen interest from government and military fleets, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).
 
Looking at the current demand, a 6/15 interview from $RIDE’s management confirmed that they have enough binding orders to fill 2021/2022 production targets.

  
**Competitive Landscape: Electric Truck Startups**

RIDE often draws comparisons to two other EV startups, Rivian and Nikola ($NKLA). Nikola is pre-revenue and seems to be much further out from mass-production, yet still has a $7B market cap. Amazon-backed Rivian is the clear leader in terms of EV startups and are likely to be [valued at or above $70B](https://insideevs.com/news/511272/rivian-seek-70billion-ipo-underwriters/) this fall when they IPO.
It is worth noting that RIDE’s replacement value for their facility is ~ $3B and they have [over $400m cash on hand](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). When looking at the monster valuations of competitors relative to RIDE’s current $1.7B market cap, it just goes to show that other EV companies in general seem to be trading at significantly higher multiples than RIDE. In fact, most trade at more than 5x future revenue.

In RIDE’s March earnings call, they announced their plans to re-tool their facility with additional funding to be able to produce 60,000 vehicles in 2022 in response to increased customer interest for their Endurance truck. Selling 60,000 vehicles would result in over $3B in revenue, which, with a 5x multiple, would lead to a market cap of over $15B for RIDE ( ~$100/share).


**Conclusion**
 
The EV market is flooded with competition, but RIDE is taking a unique approach in their business model by targeting commercial fleets. They also have one of the most productive automotive facilities in the whole United States, which bodes well for the “Buy American” initiative that the current administration has been echoing in the past several months.
Sure, there are risks investing in any startup, but RIDE presents a very nice risk/reward setup at current levels.
Short-sellers and lawsuits have caused the stock to lose ~ 60% of its value from all-time highs. With a current valuation of only $1.7B, when RIDE is mass producing their commercial fleet pick-ups in 3 months, the only problem investors will have is that they didn’t buy more. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Today, Bloomberg reported: “WORKHORSE TO FILE LEGAL CHALLENGE TO U.S. POSTAL SERVICE DECISION TO AWARD DELIVERY VEHICLE CONTRACT TO OSHKOSH”

Keep in mind, $WKHS owns 10% of $RIDE, and if WKHS gets the USPS contract, $RIDE will be building the vehicles at their facility.

The timing is very interesting here. I own $RIDE and $WKHS and might add calls.

6/17/21 02:53,"Tesla Ultimate DD Alright degenerates, how many times have your FDs expired worthless and left you recording your wife getting blown out for the weekend by her favorite day trader bf. Cause personally it's been far too many times for me and that's why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of.

Fuck squeezes I've had it with those DDs and honestly, I don't think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis. Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn't empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped.

Back in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod  showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn.  Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once.

&#x200B;

DD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn't just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. **High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it!** Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the **largest overnight asset increase in history**. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming ""squeeze"" about the latest stock they saw on somebody's shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize.   

TLDR: FSD --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck)

TLDR: Batteries --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of **DOJO,** a neural net trainer. I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that **AI runs on DATA.** The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have **billions** of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google's Waymo has a laughable **millions**. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society.

TLDR: AI & DOJO --> Stock to the Moon

&#x200B;

The crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven't covered many of Tesla's massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well)  I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it'll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. 

More points if somehow you still aren't convinced

\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS

\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast.

\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries.

\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective.

\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong.

\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter?

&#x200B;

If you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls.

6/17/21 01:35,"Invest in Stem The Weekly DD - STEM: The next Tesla?

The new era of clean energy is among us. Clean energy is being backed by governments which means lots of new dollars flowing into the industry. What’s something that not only these companies can do better, but probably everyone in general? How about becoming more efficient? This is what STEM, as a company, is aiming to do.

**What does that even mean?**

STEM’s entire existence is to enable and optimize the energy storage process. Currently, their business model has 3 revenue generating streams:

* Battery sales: STEM purchases batteries from tier-one manufacturers (Tesla, Samsung, etc.), layer on any requested technology additives and resells them.
* Energy management: STEM sells its AI, Athena, as a service. Athena accurately distributes energy effectively, alternating the system between grid power, onsite generation, and battery power for optimal cost reduction.
* Energy sales: STEM sells power from its many storage facilities.

&#x200B;

At the moment the bulk of their revenues does come from battery sales (hardware), however, they CEO of STEM has recently said they are trying to shift away from hardware and more into their energy management software as a service (SaaS - software).

Remember, the way ‘ol WallStreet looks at companies is:

Hardware = Low Margins = BAD

Software = High Margins = GOOD

Not only is STEM making the transition into a higher margin space, they are expanding into a *growing* industry.

&#x200B;

**Renewables are here to stay**

Perhaps the most obvious example governments pouring into clean energy is the $2T 2021 Infrastructure Plan proposed by Joe Biden. One of the key focuses of this plan is a $100B investment on radically upgrading the electrical grid to include more renewable energy (perfect for STEM). Furthermore, this plan reserves another $174B to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles ([source](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/31/982908847/biden-set-to-unveil-expansive-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan)). This will add additional strain to the current electrical grids and require more robust storage and energy management solutions. Although they are currently only dominating the market in California, they have big plans to expand across the entire domestic U.S, enabling them to capture a vast portion of the market.

Overall, STEM seems to be growing at an incredible rate with a large bank account to fund its rapid growth. Their cash flows are solid (recurring revenue is king) and their profit margins are very attractive. While they are currently losing money due to their high operating expenses, they expect to become profitable from 2023 onwards and are moving very quickly towards that goal.

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Like any industry, there will be some risks. In my opinion, for STEM, their biggest risk is that they are unable to capture the market in new expansions and that their SaaS and energy management service doesn’t take off. Remember, hardware industries with low margins are pretty kicked to the curb by WallStreet. Future earnings reports and expectations should emphasize their growth and transition as a software play, if not it may be reflected by the stock price taking a hit.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

Fundamentally STEM’s balance sheet is strong (completely debt free). Sitting with 525m in cash they’ve got a great opportunity to strengthen their presence outside of California, where they are currently dominating, and expand within the domestic United States. This is somewhat of a new industry, but as EV and renewable energy demand increases with the “clean energy” movement this could potentially be a good investment in a company that is set to rule this space (within the domestic US).

6/21/21 01:14,"Wall Street Bets Guide to Options: Insiders Only! Volume I Options are the best way to make a lot of money with a minimal amount of risk.

This guide will help you get started on your path to financial freedom.

Some definitions:

**Calls:** Calls let you “call” your broker and tell them how much you want to pay for a stock. Say Tesla is trading at $700. You can call your broker and tell them you want to buy it at $300. If it’s a new broker that just passed his series 7 he might say something like, “Do you mean 300 strike sir/mam?” Calmy tell this noob that you know about options from WSB and want to talk to his manager. If they still wont let you participate in call options to purchase Tesla at $300, you will need to report this to FINRA. Here is their help line: Phone: (240) 386-HELP.

**Puts:** Puts, much like Calls are insider trading tools used by many Wall Street firms. How a put option works is that you call your brokerage and tell them your want to “put” or give back your shares for their original purchase price. Puts are what you use to get a refund if things went a little awry. Lets say you smooth brain bought GME at $440 after looking at shitty memes all day, tell your broker you would like to use a put option to get a refund. You choose the price, however, one firm rule of puts is that you cannot put your shares back for more than you paid for them. So, in this case, you can put your shares back into the share pool for $440 apiece.

**Covered Calls:** Covered calls are normally only for elite wall street veterans but I will help you trade just like they do. Selling calls should not be done over the phone with your brokerage. Don’t worry Robinhood traders this isn’t a problem for you. You are going to want to do this online after you sign your margin contract with your brokerage. Covered calls are a sale of the aforementioned call options where you essentially sell something you don’t own and make money for just knowing about this trick! Its like being able to sell your neighbors car without him knowing. Its really important when selling calls to not have the underlying stocks in your account. For example, if you want to sell covered calls on Tesla, do not purchase the security first. You dont want to get them called away do you!? Another quick tip: to maximize profit always look for the most volatile stocks possible, meme stocks are great for this. Remember, keep it online, just click the sell button, go a little bit out of the money (more on this below) and you will get the biggest bang for your buck!

**In the money:** ITM is how wall street traders congratulate each other on a successful call or put option. Lets say you used a put to return your shares for a refund, when the money hits your account, you can post it on WSB to let others know you are “in the money!” You will most likely be showered with awards from wall street bettors. Wall Street bettors are very nice folks who are there to support you. Its their way of saying welcome to the club! Here’s some gold. Also, be sure to let us know what brokerage you are using so we can transfer our 4 GME shares over there.

**Out of the money:** OTM refers to trading noobs who don’t know how to trade options. Us wall street insiders consider most of retail out of the money, but now that you have found this guide you will no longer be part of this lower class of human. Trading is easy when you have the power of insider knowledge on your side.

**Strikes:** Your brokerage works on a 3 strike system. If you lose on three trades or try to buy boomer dividend stocks like GE, you will be given one strike. Strikes fall off on a rolling 30 day basis. So, if you absolutely have to buy JP Morgan cause they were Epstein’s bank / brokerage, and defended by their 2nd in command, Mary Erdoes; and, you like that they got caught with a cocaine boat ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/) ) you can only do this three times a month. Only trade options and meme stocks and you will be fine. Ive heard stories of what happens to people at with three strikes, I am not at liberty to say what happens, but lets just say goatse’s ass looked better than people who were punished by their brokerages for getting three strikes.

**Expiration:** If you don’t use your options after Ive given them to you here, they will rot. In order to keep your options fresh, its always wise to sell more covered calls described above or call your broker to buy new calls or puts.

**Intrinsic Value:** refers to what you think your options are worth. If you have options that have gone to zero but you really, really like them, well then there is a lot of intrinsic value in them.

**Extrinsic Value:** refers to the value of options that you used to own. You would say, “I am an extrinsic holder of Amazon options and they would be worth millions of dollars right now.” This is very useful information to share with others in the DD section. Extrinsic value can also refer to the value of your wife after she ran away with her latino pool boy boyfriend. For example, “My wife’s extrinsic value at the moment is the price of a Costco hotdog while she is away on her extended vacation.”

Hope this helps get you started!

6/18/21 19:39,"TSLA Upcoming 4 for 1 Stock Split - An Elon Musk Twitter Analysis Last year Elon Musk tweeted that ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"". Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

https://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

https://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to ""Elon Musk, the 2nd"" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

Our destination is still MARS (thanks to Tesla & Elon adopting AMD's APU's and GPU's).

We expect an EARLY ETA thanks for the J-Powell tailwinds. Dr. Lisa Su is still thumbs up!

Recent events provide a **HIGH degree of certainty** that AMD’s **MISSION will be successful**.

Namely:

**1- AMD Genoa (Zen 4) to have 128 cores (256 threads) winning the DATACENTER (INTEL admits)**

AMD was already taking market share from Intel in the datacenter, but the latest leak (from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV / **HE's BACK!!!**) has Intel’s own internal presentations **admitting AMD will EXTEND the LEAD** in the Datacenter (screenshot below).

[https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195](https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195)

In  essence, the AM4 will be the most successful platform in modern desktop  consumer history, with a new chip coming, with up to 15% performance  BOOST vs. AMD's AMAZING Zen 3 (5000 series).

But THAT'S NOT ALL, as in Mid-2022 Zen 4 is expected. With higher IPC, in the 5nm process, DDR5 RAM memory support and MORE CORES!!!

**To recap:**

AMD to continue **LEADING** the DATACENTER: **Check - all systems go!**

AMD to break more records with new GPU launch: **Check - all systems go!**

AMD to successfully deploy FX Super Resolution Software: **Check – all systems go!**

AMD to continue soaring with Xilinx: **Check – all systems go!**

DD on $STEM

Stem Inc. ($STEM) is an energy storage company focusing on battery storage systems, network integration, and battery optimization. They brand themselves as ""the first pure play smart energy storage company to go public"" - a lot of fancy words words I know but bear with me

First, let's take a moment to quickly understand how battery storage works. Battery storage is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. This is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy. In recent years battery storage (and in part renewable energy) hasn't seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs.

This being said, recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial / industrial level. Battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that come with it.

https://preview.redd.it/xy2e3iml1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8c903a5ac25ef5d70ad9993880886010df73d32

While battery storage has improved, it will not be stand alone solution for many years to come because it simply isn't feasible with our global energy infrastructure. Battery storage will work with our interconnected grid to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production.

Ok, so now that we know how it works, what does the market look like?

* All major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade

Great, so how is $STEM revolutionizing this space? They are doing so by providing a ""one stop shop"" solution for utility companies. Stem's solution can provide integrations with hardware (batteries) and the grid (network), while also using an AI powered software solution to optimize their energy storage.

https://preview.redd.it/ljxci0lu3yb61.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2728140badcbc979109ce3c895f65d3e6057b26

Their solution could possible replace other pure play companies in the value chain which is key.

Interesting, so let's move on to their AI software called Athena. Athena is an operating system for energy distribution and storage systems, collecting big data that enables customers to alternate between onsite generation, grid power or battery power.

https://preview.redd.it/gdctb7fs1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d3265db7fc1978a56bece0b8cac1385bac36f1

Athena is a HUGE part of their value proposition and truly could be revolutionary. It is a large part of their moat, as they have 24 issued patents for it (so no competitor can replicate it).

Now, let's move onto their financials. First, it's important to understand they have a hardware and software business

* Increased rev from $17 mil to $33 mil YoY, expected to increase to $147 mil in 2021
* 81% CAGR from 2020-2026
* Gross margins have hovered around 12-18% since 2018 but expected to increase to 40%+ by 2026
* 90% of forecasted 2021 revs are from closed executed contracts (not pipeline!) -> underpromising and overdelivering
* Software revenue expected to account for 30% of total revenues by 2026
   * $14 mil in 2020 -> $240 mil by 2026
Yeah

A majority of their revenues are from their hardware segment but it will be interesting to see how Athena contributes to their financials moving forward. They need to execute yes, but I'm confident they can do so given it has been in development for 5+ years, and they have continuously improved upon due to years of data collection. They might have used this time to validate Athena with their customers and now feel comfortable scaling it exponentially.

Lastly, I was curious to see how they compare to Tesla as well all know a large part of Tesla's valuation is their energy business. Interestingly enough, they actually use batteries from Tesla, Samsung, and Panasonic. Additionally, they have a partnership with Tesla.

In my opinion, this is an extremely attractive play in the renewables space as it is one of the pick and shovel plays in the space. If any of you are interested, my investment thesis is finding the best pick and shovel plays in emerging industries, such as renewable energy, sports betting / gambling, genomics etc. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/enigma3916) for other DDs I have done.

TLDR: Stem is a leading player in the energy storage market as they have solutions to address all major aspects of the value chain. More specifically:

* Large TAM + strong macro tailwinds
   * \~$1.2 trillion in new revenue opportunities for integrated storage expected to be deployed by 2050
   * Battery storage capacity expected to increase by 25x by 2030
* Market leader with best in class technology
   * 900+ systems operating or contracted with Athena
   * 75% market share in CA BTM storage market, largest in the US
   * First mover AI platform that operates with 40+ utilities, 5 grid operators and over 16MM runtime hours
* Highly visible growth
   * Recurring revenue streams provide strong financial position to accelerate growth
   * Revenues projected to grow at \~51% CAGR from 2021 to 2026

Hope y'all enjoy! Long $STEM

Elon musk said the 3 most important things are EV, solar energy, AND ENERGY STORAGE (watch vid above at 0:30)


ELON MUSK is building the batteries to store renewable energy, $STEM uses there software on Tesla’s batteries/and other batteries that makes them smart batteries

$STEM has more sales then Tesla/any other competitor (leading the market) by using third party batteries from Tesla. So to have more sales it must mean there software is pretty damn good as there literally using batteries from others. 

This industry is going to be huge, we need to store renewable energy as the sun doesn’t shine at night, and wind isn’t always blowing.

This stock is a baby 4bill market cap, has the most sales in the industry that’s expected to 25x (over 1.2 trillion, YET $$STEM is leading the industry), and patented software with years worth of data

6/26/21 12:22,"The Jar Jar Binks stratagem I would like to draw your attention to a trading strategy that we call the Gungan, also known as ""trading the Jar Jar"". That could be of use here.

This is when the stock chart manifests the outline of Jar Jar Binks, true hero of the Star Wars saga who first appeared in *Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace*, a Gungan who became a Senator, and was instrumental in the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine's rise to power, and the ultimate destruction of the Galactic Republic.

Some recent examples of Gungans include BlackBerry (**BB**), Tesla (**TSLA**), and Twitter (**TWTR**).

When a stock manifests this pattern, it experiences three (3) distinct stages. Each stage corresponds to a quote by Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars movies:

**Stage 1.** from Jar Jar Binks' right ear to his right eye: 

>""Yousa Follow Me Now, Okeyday?"" 

In other words follow Jar Jar, the stock share price is on an accelerating, upward trend and it is rational to buy.

[Stage 1.](https://preview.redd.it/qfjrx0kbfi771.jpg?width=1601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fec6ea64ef633e2b83ca41387ac3c316ed2d766)

**Stage 2.** from Jar Jar Binks' left eye to his right eye: 

>""Uh-Oh. Big Boomers. Ohh! Ohh! Huuhh! Uh-Oh! Ahhh! Hey! Hey! Give Me A Lift! Aaah! Oh! Aaah! Ohh!""

In other words, the share price will dip due to Boomer media lies and paper hands, but will lift again. Once it lifts, reaching the second peak (Jar Jar's left eye), consider selling.

[Stage 2.](https://preview.redd.it/058edlucfi771.jpg?width=1682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c1943c09e892f24e2961e96e1c8aa0ebb94697e)

**Stage 4.** from Jar Jar Binks' left eye to left ear: 

>""Wesa Dyin' Here.""

In other words Jar Jar is informing you that the share price is plunging and if you haven't already, you should sell by now.

[Stage 4.](https://preview.redd.it/8yg39zmdfi771.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5c5843662d91b814283f429f8b225d1a7ecab78)

Trading the Jar Jar is a ***very*** complex financial strategy, however this pattern works because, like Jar Jar Binks, the stock market is retarded.

The question here is the calls are showing an obvious loss given Tesla trading at >30 bucks higher, so how do I realize this loss to offset other gains? I looked into some conflicting tax info regarding this. It made it seem like if you don’t buy back the calls, then you can’t realize that loss and you only realize where you bought and sold the actual stock and the calls sold are taxed as short term and you lose that loss factor that could have helped offset gains.

Basically, go watch Patrick Boyle’s video on them and see all the sketchy things they’ve done to pretend to be a real vehicle/tech company. However, instead of taking a nose dive into the ground, they have climbed up to $18.00 per share from their low of like $9.50 a few months back after their crash from $75. So, what’s going on here? Is it time to but puts or calls? If you look at my post history, I am great at losing money on these kinds of questions.

The fundamentals:

Disclaimer: For the purpose of this analysis, the environment doesn’t matter. Sorry, but business is business. I hope for sustainable practices and want the world to be a cleaner and sustainable place, but that’s currently not a line-item on the income statement.

Let’s look at the financials. Nikola has less revenue than the average ice cream truck. They’re currently all sitting on the edge of their seats to see if they’ll even be able to make a real vehicle that doesn’t have to be rolled down a hill. And they’re burning poopy tons of money doing this. At the end of 2020, they had about $900,000,000 in the bank. That’s a lot of money, but how fast do they burn their Benjamins? According to their cash flow statement, they outflowed about $240,000,000 from Operating and Investing activities. Looking at their growth rate from 2018-2020, I’m ballparking a 75% increase in operating negative cash flow expenses year-over-year, but indeterminant investing activity cash flows. Remember, they want to build a bunch of charging stations around the county because their trucks will only use their proprietary charging system. I have no idea what that would cost to put these stations around the USA, but I’m imagining it’s not written with 9 digits. I don’t think they’re going to be able to afford the infrastructure or even make a viable product work before they run out of money. Between the large capital expenditures required, the quick burn rate of cash, and the necessity to either leverage up with debt or issue more shares for money, I don’t like the fundamentals for this company surviving. Cathy Wood also doesn’t like it.

Now let’s look the team: Trevor Milton is gone. This is bullish because he’s a fart-monger. If I had to guess, this is why the stock price has rebounded a little over the last few months. I can’t find much on their new CEO Mark Russell, who picked up the gig from just being their President, so I’m going to assume he’s also pretty sus because he was around when all the sketchy stuff went down. I’m probably wrong though, so he might turn this ship around. I’m not seeing anything significant on anyone else in the company, so I’m guessing they’re irrelevant. Bearish.

And that’s the problem: What if it doesn’t just go to $0.00 like it should? What if an army of retards decide that this dumpster fire is the next moonshot? I don’t know those answers, but I’m willing to take the risk and lose some money to find out if I’m right or wrong. So how about the part everyone cares about?

Puts or calls? This company doesn’t belong on Wall Street. It belong on Shark Tank with a unanimous “I’m out.” However, I know I’m retarded and terrible at doing stock analysis. There’s only like 4 numbers in my financial analysis, so it’s gotta be bad. Therefore I’m going to outsmart myself by buying some $20 Jan 2022 calls and get some some $10 Jan 2023 puts . It’s either going up a lot or down a lot. Or I’m just wrong, it just stays at $18, and I move into a nice tent under the bridge. Now if you’ll excuse me, my next appointment is waking up on my kitchen floor a few hours after my shift starts. Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀. Even though I’m thinking down.

Edit: my position is in the reply to the mod comment. Exit plan: close call at 100% profit or Close put when the company delists.

Edit 2: I put my brain to use and realized the big premium on my calls pretty much erases any potential gains on my puts, so I’ll be looking to roll those into a cheaper and closer expiry if I can, like 1-2 months out rather than 7. These options are also pretty illiquid, so I may have just painted myself into a corner on this one.

Update: rolled the call down to the October $19 call for $360. Also made $1 on closing the Jan call lol. That’s 1/2 of a McMuffin right there!",50251,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.996499658,True

Ford has done a lot in the past twelve months to show it is still in the game.  First; new CEO (hooray!). Most notably turning it's most sold truck in America (the world) into the first (beating Tesla to it) EV version. And might I add, it looks like it's got some great things going for it. Plus one for not looking aesthetically stupid looking like the Cybertruck. You get a nice new throwback vehicle (Bronco). An electric ""Mustang"" (except it doesn't have a v8 and isn't a manual, but whatever). AND a game-changer of an affordable truck starting at $20,000 MSRP, hopefully bringing back the 20K-30K vehicle wars.

If Elon wasn't a tweeting meme, I gather the 'stonk' would come crashing down, just like the window in the Cybertruck reveal.

**TD;DR**

* Passes the SMELL test
* Undervalued
* 34% short interest
* Way off its highs
* Stock pile of cash
* Stocks only go up
* Blink and you will miss it

# What is BLNK

I've come across it a few times but its always just been one of those stocks that you see and mean to buy, but got distracted because you’re out of crayons to eat and forget about it. But now that it is off its highs and all EV related stocks seem down, its perfect timing. They don't just charge your Tesla, they charge all their competitors too. Blink Charging co. owns and operates/provides electric vehicle charging equipment and EV charging services all over the US. They just Contracted to Deploy Charging stations all across New Jersey. Now that all states are required to switch a large percentage of their old boomer fuel to EV, states are rushing to make charging more accessible for their citizens, and being able to charge all electric vehicles including teslas are huge (teslas use a different charger than other electric vehicles). Their recent earnings are dismaying because they have not had any big contracts recently, but they still make profit. Now that the contracts like New Jersey are starting to come in, more will follow, which would explain over a quarter Billion in $tendies stockpile they are sitting on. Im assuming they are getting ready to amp up production with it, or roll out something big 🚀🚀🚀

# SMELL Test

Ive been seeing a lot of people using the SMELL test on here so I decided to give it a try and came up with $BLNK

**Short Interest**: SI of float is currently estimated at 34.51% by marketbeat. We aren't looking for a short squeeze, but simply extra source of buying pressure. If stock prices rise, shorts will want to close their positions soon since this stock already has an eye bulging amount of upside.

**Market cap**: 1.714 Billion according to yahoo finance

**Extremely memeable**: Don't BNLK or you'll miss it.

**Low Liquidity**: Average volume is only 3m shares according to yahoo. Institution ownership is 27.83% and most of that is brand new in 2021 with Goldman Sachs, Citi, Blackrock, JPMorgan, Schwab, all adding 40%+ to their positions just last month alone.

**Low Risk**: IV is 80% which is actually pretty low for this stock, whos high this year was 271%, even its average is 118%, so I think its taking off 🚀🚀🚀 🌕  to the moon soon and the IV with it.

# Expectations

Previously the stock exploded at the end of 2020, and only stopped when everything else EV did to breathe a bit. Now that things are heating back up, if we look at where it sat around 30 and then doubles, Im thinking it will skyrocket past its high of 60 to double again at 80 once it gets going and their new contracts roll through.

I am not a financial adviser, this is just my opinion, you are responsible for your own risk

6/22/21 23:48,"The MOST American Stock One Can Buy Is.... MP Materials. Ticker symbol MP. I can make this sophisticated but will keep it short.

The hot topic seems for ever are electrical vehicles.  And if anyone thinks we here in the USA has a clear cut advantage; you're mistaken.

You can be the most talented cook in the world and make the greatest steaks, but what happens if you have no access to cows? Your talent is irrelevant!!!

Listen to these FACTS carefully:

Without the ingredients such as you can't make a steak without cows; without RARE EARTH ELEMENTS, there is no such thing as an electric car.

So the talented engineers of electric cars in the USA have a problem. The problem? 85%. Yes 85% of the world's RARE EARTH ELEMENTS, the ingredients needed to make an electric car, comes from China!!! Yes China. You can say 95% of Tesla's parts are Chinese. And now China is in the electric car game in an ALL IN fashion. And I am talking ALL IN!!! Do you guys really think the Chinese will first support the Chinese electric car manufacturers or foreign ones like Tesla? China has TWO billion people and they are LITERALLY at the brink of converting the entire country into a highway system. Imagine when cars first came to America. That is whats going on in China and ALL of these cars will be electric. 

So the demand for RARE EARTH MATERIALS will go through the roof in which China WILL HAVE to ostracize all other nations and ONLY give their rare earth elements to their OWN electric car manufacturers period. Its common sense. Human behavior. Market behavior.  Lets not be naive.

But, we have been given a GIFT from the EV gods. MP. MP is the ONLY rare earth elements miners in the ENTIRE United States and heres the good news, they account for 15% of the entire world's rare earth elements!!! Without MP, trust me electric cars in the United States would be risky because we are 1000 percent dependent on China. But, MP takes us off the hook. 

With MP, we prevent geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. Oh yes thats where electric cars are going. Its no different than the missile race of the 80s between Russia and America.  Ev cars are the NEXT big thing for economies because with EV we also must consider autonomous driving that would change the world. So EV is not just a green save the planet play.

Back to MP. Our United States EV makers are sooo lucky to have the SECOND largest rare earth miner in the world to support the United States electric vehicle car makers! And the company is ALREADY profitable and growing like weeds.  They are growth story that is already profitable with no debt!!!! As solid of a stock in this situation as you can get.

But, yet....yet TWENTY PERCENT of MP stock is short. I've done zillions of hours of research where many think the Chinese are shorting it and many have other theories. And the EXPERTS in consensus continue to say you have to be crazy to short such a stock destined for greatness. 

MP protects us ALL in the United States literally.  They are our protectors for the EV battle and race. And I hope we all can understand this. That without MP, electric cars in the US long term is a pipe dream. We need OUR VERY own to supply the United States with the ingredients (rare earth elements) to make EV vehicles.  Without the mega success of MP,  what happens if China tells are US electric vehicle manufacturers, ""sorry we are low on supply this year and we cannot provide you with the elements you need."" That WOULD happen 1000% and it would send a shock to our ev markets. But, with MP we would never ever have a supply issue and hence because MP is our very own and with government subsidies etc- will help our own EV manufacturers to produce even cheaper. 

MP is a NATIONAL SECURITY play PLUS a phenomenal profitable company that LITERALLY has the largest rare earth mining in North America. YET IT IS SHORTED 20%......Folks TWENTY PERCENT......Now let's not be naive. Ask yourselves who would want MP to fail? Let's not be naive. Obviously this highly shorted tells me, someone is scared of MPs success and I believe its geopolitical.  As Americans lets drive these shorts out of this PURE AMERICAN SECURITY company so MP can supply US EV MAKERS FOREVER! Lets burn the shorts here. And the stock is pure fundamentals as well. JP Morgan recently few days ago put an outperform overweight rating on it.

Lets show MP we have their backs as they have our US EV makers back!",50540,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999258459,True

# I've got more news... and frankly, it is beyond my wildest dreams.

We  had **TESLA** loving AMD, adopting their APUs & GPUs in the MODELS X  and S, and an optional for other vehicles. This pushes AMD to MARS... as  autonomous driving is a perfect for gaming.

We  had **Google** signing a contract to adopt Milan Epyc Datacenter CPUs for virtual machine offerings... SMOKING intel. HUGE DATACENTER WIN, as the TCO is dropped dramatically.

We had the 6900XTX Liquid Cooled breaking **World Records** (previously held by the 6900XT).

We have **Valve** releasing a new handheld with AMD by the holiday season 2021.

We have **Fidelity FX Super Resolution** with AMAZING FPS boosts in Ultra Quality and Quality modes (launching **tomorrow**).

We  have the AMD Advantage Program for LAPTOPS allowing for a 5900HX (TOP  mobile CPU) to be paired with a RX 6800M, an VALUE HIGH-END mobile GPU.  Giving Mobile 3080 like performance at $1650, with high refresh monitor  (300Hz on 1080p to 140Hz on 1440p).

But now... it is **Samsung**'s latest info.

We knew AMD was coming in the Galaxy S22.... but it gets BETTER!!!

The  performance of RDNA2 in mobile is **beating expectations**... and SAMSUNG  is signing a future deal with AMD... as they are **SUPER PLEASED** with  AMD's performance. Samsung will effectively ABANDON their GPU plans and  work with AMD going forward.

But that IS NOT ALL.... **GOOGLE** also wants AMD in their Mobiles.

Google, the **Android** software developer... wants AMD. This is NUTS.

7/2/21 16:48,"EVGO team rings morning bell on NASDAQ, tomorrow (July 2)--great short term and long term forecast! Hi folks,

Tomorrow, EVGO, joins the likes of Chargepoint and Blink. The EVGO leadership team will also be ringing the bell at market open on NASDAQ, which should generate quite a bit of investor interest. 

""To celebrate the milestone, members of EVgo, LS Power and CLII will ring the opening bell at the Nasdaq in New York on July 2, 2021.""

EVGO is the nation's largest public fast charging network, and I anticipate this company and stock to grow quickly over the next few months. Some of its partners include Tesla, GM, Ford, KIA, Hyundai and Nissan.

EVGO also recently hired an individual who worked for Bernie Sanders to lobby for them on the Hill. This company will surely be a candidate and benefit from federal support, including the upcoming infrastructure bill. 

I anticipate a near term price target of $22+. My EOY price target is $35+.

Very excited!

Anyone else bullish on EVGO or other EV charging stocks? Which ones and why?


Good luck!

7/2/21 06:12,"A different kind of post - Classic narrative Lately a new narrative has taken over the interwebz.

Instead of investing in innovation and entrepreneurship, it is researching which stocks have heavy short interest and creating a movement to exploit this in order to create explosive growth.

The technique is clear and obvious.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Now onto the classic part of this post:

Every day I check a list of equities.  I don't pretend to think this is a great list or even a good list but it's my list hah

I first look at Tesla (I still think it is over valued but I like to see how it tracks).

I then look at Ride, NKLA, QS.  NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol

Then I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake.

Then I go to Nakd, and Fold.

Then I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola.  I weirdly like to look at Moderna.

Then I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme.

Then I check out Canopy.

Then BB, AMC, GME.

Then SLV, GLD.

Then Trillium, CRISPR.

Then onto the coins.

Then RKT and SPCE.

It is a weird routine I have each and every day almost.

I think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere.  

I think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is.

All in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world.  Also through google finance I get some good recommends on companies that I don't know about that maybe I will like based on that list and then I expand it sometimes.

Companies like CRISPR being the things I want to invest in for a better world.  Despite that I am not touching any of this shit with a 10 foot poll based on the pricing and our current market.

What equities would you add to look at and why.

I'd love to know what your lists are and the reasoning you like to track those particular sets of equities and such. :)

After a woman protested Tesla at the Shanghai Auto Show in April, state media organs compared their cars to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. 

Yes, really. 

Both in terms of production and sales, Tesla needs China. 

But does China need Tesla? With three viable EV startups on the market, the answer is no. 

First off, it is no coincidence that XPeng, Li Auto, and Nio all opened around 2015, when Tesla first started to become profitable. DiDi drove out Uber, Baidu drove out Google, and these EV startups will drive Tesla out of the biggest EV market in the world, because the Chinese government has a history of economic protectionism. They subsidize the fuck out of the industries they want developed, then force out Western companies by any means necessary. 

Look, I’m not saying “don’t invest in Tesla.” I’m saying consider the three EV startups in China, and watch that market very, very fucking closely.

6/30/21 14:48,"The Mass Market is set: Fisker (FSR) vs. Tesla (TSLA) vs. electric vehicle maker Volkswagen The mass market for battery electric vehicles is now set for the near future.

In one corner is Fisker:

[Fisker, Foxconn Firm Up Plan For Sub-$30,000 EV, Target U.S. Production In 2023](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/05/13/fisker-foxconn-firm-up-plan-for-sub-30000-ev-target-us-production-by-late-2023/?sh=7abee1c26b1c)

Excerpt:

> The companies signed an agreement for the so-called Project PEAR (an acronym for personal electric automotive revolution) Thursday and said they intend to sell the small, five-passenger vehicle with a starting price below $30,000. The two companies are jointly investing in the project and collaborating to ensure they can deliver a relatively low-cost, easy-to-build vehicle.

And:

> The new vehicle will be smaller than the Ocean and likely be available in a shorter-range version, with a smaller battery pack, to reach the under-$30,000 price level, and a pricier long-range version, Fisker said, without elaborating. The goal is to make more than 250,000 units of the new vehicle at assembly sites in the U.S. and overseas.

In another corner is Tesla, planning to roll out what will likely be the Model 2:

And:

> Production of the newly designed battery packs will commence in 2022, and if Tesla’s claims come true, the Model 2 could have a highly competitive range, since Musk has earlier stated that a range of 250 miles (402 km) is “unacceptably low”.

Yet in another corner is electric vehicle maker Volkswagen, armed not just with the first mass market EV - the ID.3 - but with more models in the works in its push to become the next market leader in consumer-targeted battery EVs.

6/29/21 20:59,"AMD passed the MOON and MARS... Galaxy S/22 is next!!! (hop on!) # DEAR APES,

A few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.

Today, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!

The deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.

There's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**

The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.

TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.

&#x200B;

[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)

With autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.

So, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.

Then you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.

On GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. ""Chiplets"" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, with less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.

On console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.

On Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre & Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.

[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)

Deals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.

Last, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**

AMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. Its GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.

**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.

&#x200B;

[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)

But enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?

Revenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?

And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. AMD raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.

AMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.

AMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue & profit) is $500 billion.

How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?

It is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.

So yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.

Analyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which is roughly an 18% upside, taking it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.

If you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.

Lastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.

Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.

AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.

# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.

I bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).

Today, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.

If you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).

WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).

7/4/21 15:19,"What kind of performance would Tesla have to deliver to justify its share price  

We’ve built a very simple model for Tesla to see if we can make sense of its valuation.  The model is very simple and has just three forecast variables: revenue growth, operating margin, and capital turns (which measure how efficiently the company utilizes its capital). These three variables are all we need to do our analysis.

What we’ve specifically tried to model out is what kind of financial performance Tesla would have to deliver in order to justify its current share price.  This means playing with my three forecasts variables until I get to $600.

I’ve used consensus revenue forecasts over the next two years as a starting point, and then proceeded from there.  Note that consensus revenue estimates for Tesla are $49.1 billion for 2021, and $65.7 billion for 2022.  This is extraordinary, and represents growth rates of 55% and 34% over the next two years. These growth rates don’t seem sustainable, so beyond 2022, I’ve trended revenue growth rates down to 20% and carried this forward.

I should point out that for capital intensive businesses like Tesla, revenue growth, especially at these levels, is never free, because it requires a company to continually reinvest in the business.  For Tesla, it means continually investing in additional production capacity in order to meet production and sales targets.  You will see this reflected in our cash flow forecasts, where annual capex requirements means negative cash flows for the first few years                                             .

In terms of margins, Tesla has seen steady improvement over the last few years as it scales up, and there’s no reason to think they can’t continue to improve margins further.  Tesla is after all a premium brand, and commands premium pricing. Nevertheless, the EV space is attracting a lot of new players and a lot of new investment, and this will likely put a cap on Tesla’s margin expansion into the future.

For modelling purposes, our NOPAT margin variable is our key lever, and we’ve had to ramp this up very aggressively to hit our $600 target.  Tesla’s NOPAT margin is currently around 5%, but we’ve had to gradually move this up to 18.5% over the next few years.  Now the comps we’ve selected aren’t perfect, but you will notice that at these levels, Tesla’s NOPAT margin would be well above industry benchmarks.  You will also notice that our forecasts generate an ROIC (return on invested capital) of almost 33% at its peak, again well above industry standards.

### What does it all mean?

I’m not going to take a view here, except to say that Tesla is priced for perfection, and this is reflected in the model numbers. Again, the purpose of the exercise was to see what kind of financial performance Tesla would have to deliver in order to justify its current share price. I’ll let you decide whether you think the forecasts are reasonable or not, and then by extension whether you think the current share price can be justified.

In the meantime, I am attaching a copy of the model here, so feel free to play around with it for yourself.

People keep speculating as to what’s going to happen tomorrow when NVDA effects its 4-to-1 stock split, dropping the share price from $750 to $187.50. To that, I say look at what  $TSLA and $AAPL both did right after their splits this year:

In the days following the split, both TSLA and AAPL lost between 10-20% of their share value (post split), continuing to fall for approximately 1-2 weeks post split. 

I think NVDA will share a similar fate despite the overselling dip we saw last Friday and the bounce today. 

If so, NVDA is likely to drop for the remainder of this week, perhaps even into next week, and then recover and far surpass split price for the remainder of the year (excluding external covid factors on the market). 

I'm bearish in the very short term on these facts, and super bullish in the longterm. Going for a quick put option scalp on weeklies, then will likely take leaps and other longer calls.

Precisely because everyone knows.

Since this essentially bullish underlying demand exists, the market won’t crash. The crash and subsequent rise from buyers waiting for a dip is already priced in.

7/16/21 19:17,"Why I think Michelin could be a good long-term play. This is my first DD, please be gentle and tender, but abuse me at the same time.

With things starting to reopen and lockdowns slowly being lifted around the world, more people are going to be using their cars again and wearing out their tyres.

Who do you think of when you think tyres? Michelin.

""But this isn't long term?"" I hear you ask.

Yes it is, here's how I think that Michelin's performance will be tied to the rise of electric vehicles.

As I'm sure you all know, electric motors provide instant torque to the wheels. It's how the Tesla Model S and cars like the Rimac Nevera are able to achieve such blisteringly quick acceleration times. One of the downsides of this instant torque is increased wear on the tyres.

I came up with this thesis after watching the Lotus Evija, a new electric hypercar, at the Goodwood festival of speed. When the car launched, there were huge plumes of tyre smoke, far more so than any of the petrol powered cars.

https://youtu.be/g3ZqeNQKiE8

The Evija appears at 36 seconds.

Although this is an extreme example, something similar will be happening every time someone starts from a standstill in their electric vehicle, albeit at a much smaller scale. It's these microslips that wear down tyres faster in normal electric vehicles.

Michelin also supplies tyres to semi trucks around the world. I believe that the use of semi trucks to transport goods will see a sharp rise in the future. Cargo ships are currently one of the single biggest factors in pollution around the world and we're a lot closer to having electric semi trucks than we are to having electric ships.

More electric semi trucks means more tyres are going to get burnt through.

The biggest bear case that I can think of is that people are going to continue working from home after the pandemic ends, meaning that less people will be using their vehicles to commute to work. If this is the case, there is evidence to suggest that many people will move away from major cities, as they no longer need to pay the exorbitant prices required to be near their former office job. This process of mass urban sprawl would just increase the distance needed to travel between places on a day to day basis, counteracting most of the effects of people working from home.

7/15/21 16:05,"GME SOTU and Technical Analysis: Crayons aren't only for eating, they're also for confirming bullish bias Greetings retards, autists and apes. Here to share my outlook and some very simple TA in way too many words that you don't know how to read which may have already been invalidated in after hours trading with the vanilla NFLX news. This is a fictional account and not investment advice.

# Preface

Today is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI.

GME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself.

# Where we are at

Today just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports:

7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER.

2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( 🚀 ) and below it is bearish (🌈).

4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering.

6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line)

Not only are we at these multiple, coinciding levels of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). *An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull* /u/Uberkikz11 *and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1/20/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod.*

But wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx with AAPL now carrying all of the weight. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7/15) or sometime next week, the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks). Watch AAPL weakness for clues.

All this being said, today I would put us at or around 3/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in.

# Where we are going

All these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235).

At the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never.

Now, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard.

# GamePlan

**Immediate term:** Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close.

IF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday.

Targets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy.

IF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut. Possible supports at 151, 137, 110, 48, 40. Wait for confirmation.

**Earnings play:** Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8/20. Sell into strength BEFORE earnings.

7/15/21 12:28,"ONCE WERE AUTISTS. I truly HATE what has happened to WSB due to the whole FUCKING meme stock revolution.

Instead of just being happy with ourselves for unexpectedly making bank with TSLA, AMC, GME, et al, many of us thought we were suddenly geniuses.

And many of those who weren't IN on those parties the first time wanted to be THE NEXT TIME!!

We also got a reputation in the Media for thinking outside the box AND acting in CONCERT to MOVE STOCKS. (In other words something very close to PUMPING!)

The sub got FLOODED with new people, many of whom were just plain GREEDY and/or STUPID, and many of whom broke the rules. Who weren't FUNNY. Who didn't have anything of value to share. Who wanted just to PUMP their own stock. Or to find out WHAT was the new meme, because they were too lazy to learn anything first, and then pump THAT!  Mods were busy night and day trying to keep it reasonable.

All other interesting and often very valuable discussions started to subside. And with them, a very WONDERFUL, and rare good-humor. After calling each other names, we actually REACHED OUT WITH KINDNESS to those of us who were experiencing loss or some other trouble. Increasingly, to me at least, it has become less kind, and interesting, and a lot more venal.

In the last few days, have you seen what is happening to the AMC subs? Its partisans are all on an **ALEX JONES-LEVEL** **CRUSADE** against all the ***imaginary enemies*** that are ***secretly manipulating*** the prices downward. **NEVER MIND THE STOCK WAS $1.92** on January 1st for good reasons, and could reasonably be expected to return to earth at some point...NOoooo!

There were 'investigative reports' about illegal naked shorts and fake shares. People started taking it all WAY TOO  SERIOUSLY. They put their student loan money on it, they could barely wait for Friday so they could put their checks on it.  One guy used the fact that he needs to take care of his handicapped mom to put ALL of his money on it.  It now is an ALL OUT WAR against some fuck named Kenny who is supposedly masterminding all this evil. And the only way to fight it is to BUY **MORE** of the **SAME TANKING MEME STOCK!!**  **BRILLIANT!!**

First of all, it's NOT a conspiracy. Or if it is, we should acknowledge that WE ALSO ARE A CONSPIRACY, okay?  But even if it were, how is it effective to just SIT THERE AND LET THEM KEEP CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU??!! I mean, the more you prove you can't win, the more you should just LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME, No? But I am actually worried somebody is going to get HURT  by this. It's TOO SERIOUS,  GUYS. IT HAS TO STOP!!    **I don't want**  **Sept 11 NIHILISM IN MY SUBREDDIT, OKAY?!**

Here's what I think...we need to stop being the fucking 'meme stock promoter people' and go back to being the 'hidden opportunity exploiters', the class clowns, the ne'r do wells, etc.

I'm pretty much a permabear anyway and don't try to hide it, but I get yelled at, banned, and called a 'shill' and a lot worse for trying to INFORM PEOPLE who are not experienced that **WE ARE NOT HERE TO ENDLESSLY PROMOTE MEME STOCKS whose time has GONE.**

So, I PROPOSE we start DELIBERATELY SHORTING meme stocks or buying puts on them. I've made like 60% on my admittedly tiny portfolio in the last 2 days with puts on AMC. I'M  GONNA START RUBBING IT INTO YOUR GREEDY APE ASSES, TOO!!

Which reminds me.  I am kinda SICK of this WHOLE APE motif, too. It's so OVER-DONE. **Fuck,  when did we vote for THAT!?** Now all the media is calling us that. Okay, you idiots that want to pretend you are too dumb to care about the valuation of stock but want to call anybody who disagrees with you a SHILL, You be the APES!!  I don't even remember what we were BEFORE. OH YEAH....WE USED TO BE AUTISTS, REMEMBER?

But would we stay on the NEWS, with CNBC counting how many times we mentioned 'blubber' if they had to refer to us a AUTISTS??  NOOOO!! Chad and Veronica would WRITE ANGRY EMAILS to REDDIT. No, we had to TONE IT DOWN. So we became nice, SOFT, friendly apes. Lots of poo and banana joke material there. AH HAHAHAHAHA!! So VERY funny, those apes.

I want Bears, Shorts and AUTISTS to have EQUAL RESPECT. Do you hate Hedge Funds?  GREAT!!! Make a case for us SHORTING THEM and maybe we will do it.  But don't get your damn knickers in a twist if I don't give a shit about your grandma not being able to afford a new colostomy bag because I refuse to help pump your fucking worthless meme stock, **ASSHOLE!!**

This is a real deal company that is being bashed by anyone and everyone... The last report about it being a scam complained that they didn't release and proprietary information, which no company should.

Most scam companies struggle so see insider shares held past 5% at this point.

So why is this thing selling off? It was used to make money, and that's sad but that's the business. This company doesn't expect to make money until 2024 or 2025 and any movements until 2023 should all be speculation and prep.

U.S. electric vehicle registrations increased by 95% from January to April Although electric vehicles now account for only a small part of the total global car sales, the global adoption of electric vehicles is significantly accelerating. According to foreign media reports, this is obvious in the first four months of 2021 in the United States. Compared with the same period in 2020, the number of electric vehicle registrations in the country has increased by 95%. 

　　 According to a new report by Experian, from January to April 2021, the total number of new car registrations in the United States was 36% higher than the same period last year. Part of the reason is as the country's economy recovers from the epidemic. 

　　According to a MarketWatch report, in the first quarter of 2021, electric vehicles still accounted for only 2.3% of the US market, but during this period, the rate of customers registering new electric vehicles was three times that of other types of new vehicles. Tesla remains the dominant player in this category, with 71% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States being the company's cars. 

　　 Two main models are among the best among competitors: Tesla Model Y has 53,102 new registrations, and Model 3 has 35,468 registrations. Followed by Chevrolet Bolt with 13,611 registrations, Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,104 registrations, and Nissan Leaf with 5,023 registrations.

7/13/21 22:48,"ELMS- I think it's going to be the Tesla of cargo vans, and bought in heavy on this first all electric cargo van that will come to market in the US. Am I right? When is was still a SPAC, I bought 5300 shares for $9.74, and 2000 warrants for $1.58. Now that ELMS is a real ticker and I sold some other stock that paid off,  I was thinking of buying maybe  another 1000 shares today, but now after thinking about it a little more I think maybe several thousand more. Since they will be the first one to come to market in the US, are US built and have thousands of pre-orders already, and are already building all electric prototypes of bigger van body trucks (think Uhaul and Ryder size trucks) I really believe they will be the Tesla of commercial vehicles. Other manufacturers are coming behind them, but they will gain the first foothold on that market I think. I have been mostly lucky in picking my start-ups, and feel better and better about this one.

7/13/21 12:52,"MVIS DD Upcoming catalysts :

1. IVAS ARMY update after user jury discussion on Jul 12. Possible announcement or update from Microsoft. Which will in turn make MVIS and “ another company” spike. 


2. ER date announcement(leads to hype and we are also waiting for closure of 140 million ATM offering #warchest)



3. Q2 2021 results (and possible update on outside validation of LRL(long range Lidar) A-sample. 




4. IAA Show on September (finally publicly showing LRL to world at mobility show where top OEMs and TEIR 1s will be attending as well. It’s in Germany so the likes of Volkswagen will be there.) 



With a 140 million #WARCHEST and public display coming I’d be surprised if we don’t get an official partnership before the show in September. 

And may I remind you this company has already landed partnerships with giants. They who shall not be named!! And the likes of sharp and others. Do some research and you will understand what I mean. Hint. Bill gates. LOL 


I’ll also add that Microsoft is partnered with Volkswagen

Data to be released this week will reveal that the Volkswagen Group hasn’t just overtakeb Tesla TSLA for the Number One slot in European battery electric vehicle (EV) sales, but has already streaked away.

Schmidt Automotive Research data shows the Volkswagen Group has more than doubled Tesla’s sales in rolling 12-month EV sales in Europe and its lead continues to grow.

Europe’s rolling 12-month EV sales grew to 856,000 from May 2020 to April 2021, and the Volkswagen Group claimed 206,400 of them.

Also July 12 2021 we had an 8-k filed for CFO Steve holt

The Role of a CFO in Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisitions

Once a company has narrowed down a list of counterparties (either potential buyers, investors or acquisition targets), or has entered the transaction phase, the CFO’s role transforms into chief negotiator – making sure the company achieves the best deal possible. Both seller and buyer want to maximize synergy to make sure they’re extracting the most a deal can financially offer. It’s critical during this stage that CFOs from both sides maintain open communication about acquisition conditions, growth potentials, and other financial targets that will make the deal a success.

As these negotiations progress and the end of a transaction nears, the CFO must simultaneously create a comprehensive integration plan that will be ready for execution the moment a deal ends.

 90,000 RSU's awarded to Holt, transferable upon change of control? $200k bonus payable NOW?

$140M ATM to show a stronger balance sheet to potential partners and customers? #WARCHEST ??


https://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/article/downloads/ACCDG_Spr15Sem_HSpiropoulos.pdf

Using a sample of U.S. firms during the period 2003-2012, we examine whether M&amp;amp;As impact the compensation of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in the bidding and integration phases of M&amp;amp;As. Our findings indicate that CFOs total compensation is higher in the year of acquisition relative to all other CFOs. The higher total compensation of CFOs is driven by higher equity incentives. Furthermore, CFOs receive a greater proportion of their compensation in the form of equity during and immediately after the year of acquisition. We also investigate if CFO compensation during M&amp;amp;A years is driven by M&amp;amp;A characteristics. We find that CFO compensation is higher in M&amp;amp;A years when; the deal size is larger, the time to completion is shorter, and when the target firm has a different 2-digit SIC code. CFO compensation is not associated with the short term change in the acquiring firms share price.

Also looks like waymo is looking to incorporate a “new Lidar” system for their robo taxis 

Waymo to integrate new LIDAR into the autonomous driving system for Level 4 autonomous driving ?

[https://waymo.com/joinus/3218427/](https://waymo.com/joinus/3218427/)

* **Design and implement data and control flow needed to integrate new LIDAR into the autonomous driving system**
* **Develop, deploy, and optimize custom hardware drivers** 
* **Develop novel calibration processes involving multiple sensors and actuation stages in the loop**
* **Analyze data collected from sensor systems, and develop tools to help do so**
* **Support sensor manufacturing by customizing existing systems to improve test integration, assembly tracking, and reporting pipelines**
* **FPGA programming and supporting ASIC development teams**

What i found additionally interesting is Microvision has two new software development requirement opened up. And those requirements uses ""**CUDA""** which is supported **only on Nvidia GPUs**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA)

[https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/?p=job%2FoWE5ffwE](https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/?p=job%2FoWE5ffwE)

**Experience with GPU Acceleration and frameworks, such as Cuda, OpenCL, or OpenGL.**

So i am pretty confident that Microvision LIDAR component uses NVIDIA GPU as we speculated before by many of us. 
Picture of A-sample Lidar 👇

CUDA (an acronym for Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia.

CUDA works with all Nvidia GPUs from the G8x series onwards, including GeForce, Quadro and the Tesla line.

Look into MVIS board of directors. The likes of Judy Curran and Seval Oz. And the recently hired Drew Markham as legal counsel. Known for M&amp;A. 

“Strategic Partnerships Timeline” – Things said by Sumit Sharma

August 8, 2020 – Q2 2020 Conference Call:

I note that Mergermarket recently published an article about our strategic process. The article referred to strong interest from bidders. I would like to clarify that we are engaged in discussions with certain potential interested parties who are at various stage of >diligence.

We do not plan to make public statement about any bid or a potential transaction unless and until and appropriate agreement is reached.

(Bunch of stuff between August 2020 and Feb 2021 about how completing the A-Sample will create value for MVIS. Something that will be required if we’re looking for that +$15bn buyout IMHO).

 February 16, 2021 – MicroVision Announces $50M ATM:

“We continue to make progress on completing our development goal of producing the best-in-class lidar sensor for range, resolution with velocity field output and remain on track to meet our previously announced April 2021 milestone. We believe this financing will give us an opportunity to firmly solidify our balance sheet as we remain committed to pursuing strategic alternatives and building value for our shareholders,”

 March 11, 2021 – Q4 2020 Conference Call:

“I would also like to thank our shareholders for their support that allows us to focus on obtaining the right value while exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the Company. I'm saying that strategic alternatives is the right way to think about it. And we are a stand-alone company right now, but we're up for sale. So I think that's the best way I can answer it.”

 April 29, 2021 – Q1 2021 Conference Call:

“I want to emphasize that the Company remains committed to exploring all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. In October 2020 we set the objective to complete our lidar product and said having hardware that can be productized would be an important step for evaluation by potential interested parties. We completed that objective in April as planned and are prepared to support any potential evaluation of our technology and capability to scale. As I shared earlier today, I believe our sensor technology is differentiated by features that will potentially be recognized as disruptive in the market. I have shared with you that I believe consolidation in this space will continue and signs of this are starting to become public. I believe MicroVision needs to continuously build value with our products, roadmaps, and partnerships, while also exploring strategic alternatives.”

 May 26, 2021 – 2021 Annual Shareholder Meeting:

The completion of A-Sample hardware of our long-range lidar sensor on schedule was a major accomplishment. Passing this milestone provides an opportunity for potential customers and strategic partners to begin meaningful engagement on evaluation of our technology and capabilities.

 June 17, 2021 – Drew Markham as General Council:

Markham has more than 20 years of experience advising publicly traded technology companies in corporate governance, M&A and capital markets transactions… “Drew’s breadth of legal experience, in particular her transactional and governance work, will be an asset to the company as we focus on engaging with potential customers and partners, demonstrating key features of our long-range lidar sensor, as well as with parties interested in strategic opportunities.”

 So what’s changed? Nothing IMO. They need to build value so we can justify this large +$15 billion dollar valuation we all have in the back of our minds.

How does MicroVision build tens of billions of dollars in value?** By signing a long term supply contract.**

June 21, 2021 – MicroVision Announces $140M ATM Equity Facility

“I am proud of the progress our Company has made advancing our automotive lidar program. We look forward to more broadly promoting our technology to OEM and Tier 1 suppliers and publicly testing our sensor with external test-site partners,” said Sumit Sharma, MicroVision Chief Executive Officer. “A strong balance sheet gives our potential customers and partners confidence that MicroVision is a capable and trusted long-term supplier.”

NIO makes it to where customers pay a subscription for their battery so they can save around 8k and not worry about Battery degregation. As a customer you pay a monthly subscription for this service. You can also just buy the battery 

Battery Swapping: China has over 600 battery swap stations (I Believe).
80% of ppl in China live in Apts so having your own charger is pretty tough. (This was proven by multiple Chinese YouTubers who own Tesla’s, XPENGs, NIOs ect. 

China is also a sleeping E-commerce giant. NIO life products selling out in Minutes, they sell food, clothing, bags, all high quality. They’re wanting to change the view on Chinese quality.

Degenerates! Let me introduce you to a company with a cute animal as their mascot. This stock has been shorted so much in the past 2 weeks, and I want to bring some apes or in this case some hippos along for the ride. Full disclosure: I own 2000 shares and am willing to buy more tomorrow before their earnings call on Monday during AHs.

What does the company do? Hippo is a transformative homeowner's insurance company well-positioned to disrupt a $108 billion industry. Legacy insurers will be caught flat-footed in the same way Tesla disrupted the auto industry and Sofi is expected to disrupt the personal finance industry.

The spac was valued at over $6B when it was merged but has been shorted all the way down to $2.95B and the price is now at $5.27 per share as of August 15, 2021. There was zero news for the stock to go down except for being ""overvalued"". This company is now around half of the market cap since the merger and 50% less than LMND's market cap (Their biggest competitor) but yet HIPO still makes more money. This should be shown in the earnings calling happening on Monday (August 16) during after-hours. On August 13, 2021, the stock was shorted at a 78% volume ratio.

SPAC founders (RTPZ), HIPO exces are not allowed to sell for 2 years unless the price vesting is triggered which are $12.50, $15, and $20. This means if the CEO wants to sell his shares within the next 2 years this stock needs go up 137%. Also the PIPE investors bought in at $10 per share which means they are less likely to sell at almost a 50% loss. I don't know about you guys but less insider selling is good enough for me!

Also every time the stock goes up 50 cents, since the price as of market close on Friday, August 13 ($5.27). I promise I will donate $100 to the Save The Hippo fund. (link not included due to content guidelines)",52339,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.702811897,True

Stock is at at an all time low after a slew of bad press.  Expectations are low but upside is huge if they report presales and continue to remain on track for production next month. 

If their production schedule remains unchanged (which they continue to say they are on track) then they might be the first to market with an electric truck.  Tesla’s cyber truck was just delayed to 2022 and the only other player promising a truck by end of this year that I can see is Rivian (who have already announced delays from their original July dates so who knows). 

The shorts have taken pretty outrageous positions.  At last check they were over 28% of float and rising.  

I am personally expecting all of these factors to lead to a massive breakout by end of today.

TLDR- can’t get much lower, most likely first to market ev truck,  shorts over 28% so fuck em.

8/11/21 04:10,"BofA’s Geoff Meacham stated Moderna is over valued based on the fundamentals BofA analyst Geoff Meacham said Moderna is over valued based on the fundamentals


He compared 130 years old Merck(MRK) & 40 years old Amgen(AMGN).

And the market overreacted in co-ordination(BofA has long hands that can reach too far & wide)
See some facts below:
1) 130 years old Merck and 172 years old Pfizer could not make mRNA vaccine. Pfizer is marketing German BioNTech's vaccine. PFE did not invent it.
2) Moderna can not be assessed on age-old fundamentals. The same way Apple, Amazon, Tesla because their valuation is way over.
3) Insulin has increased more than 1200% since it was invented.
4) Gilead Sciences Sets US Price for COVID-19 Drug at $2340 to $3120
5) Gilead Sciences Sovaldi, a drug that can cure Hepatitis C in 90 days when used in combination with other antiviral drugs. The initial price was more than $1,000 per day, and the total cost of treatment could exceed $80,000
6) Moderna has only 1 product to sell. Which happens to be in the middle of a pandemic. Moderna was awarded some funding and it is keeping its prices down for Covid vaccines.
7) Moderna does not need to keep its prices down for future products since it will not meet with a similar pandemic.
8) Moderna has developed 100 proteins in the last 10 years but did not have enough funding to continue with the product R&D.
9) Now Moderna has the cash and can spend money for R&D so it can release many products in the years to come

Now how would you compare the company valuation when there are so many factors in play?
BofA’s Geoff Meacham said to compare its last 4 successful quarters – Moderna started selling its only product i.e. Covid vaccine from last Dec in the middle of the pandemic.

The insulin & Gilead was added for comparison that Moderna would not need to cap its future product price(Covid vaccine price is capped due to small government funding & Pandemic) and therefore will not need to sell many doses to make up the revenue

8/8/21 17:38,"$WISH Discussion: US/China trade tensions. Given that $WISH hv a significant number of Chinese merchants, many investors may be concerned over growing trade tensions between US and China but here’s my take. 

1. Many businesses in US depend on China. We may not be familiar with the names of the many SMEs in US that depends on or benefits from China’s cheaper production costs but we most likely have heard of the big names such as Tesla, Apple, Gillette, Levi’s, Barbie dolls, Ray Bans, Nike, Converse etc and the list goes on and on.
2. Game theory. US is not likely to fuck themselves, their economy and China is not going to fuck themselves either, exiting from such a large market. Both sides are going to suffer the loss of an unprecedented number of jobs and the effect of which is an unimaginable hit in their economies. The best outcome for both cums from co-operation.
3. If for any reason that the size of their genitals matters more to them than their economies and people, we must remember that the rest of world gets fucked as well. This shit could cause a recession that spreads faster than a STD in college, so that’s additional protection (pun fully intended). If all else fails, maybe the UN may just send Samuel L Jackson down as The Negotiator to diffuse the tensions. 
4. With all that being said, if push comes to shove. Imo for a worst case scenario, they may just go into a “you-do-yours, I-do-mine” mindset and maybe China stocks get delisted from US stock exchange. Imagine this: BABA, JD, PDD delisted from US markets. Guess what... $WISH is an American based e-commerce platform. Boom. Mic drop.",52776,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.768285811,True

&#x200B;

Why is Tesla worth anything? Cause they are ahead of the curve. They are ahead on electric cars. They have all other car manufacturers laying awake at night thinking about the moment they should have let Elon Must fuck their wives in accordance with the applicable tech transfer.

Hyzon is ahead of the curve with hydrogen power. period. Hydrogen cars, hydrogen storage, and they have a leadership that is taking them in a focused direction. They arent targeting consumer hydrogen, there isnt a market there. They know the space that hydrogen can exist and its in heavy duty trucks and energy storage. 

They are ahead of the curve because they already have contracted sales and expected deliveries in 2022:

[Hyzon Motors to deliver Australia's first hydrogen-powered trucks to Coregas, a Wesfarmers company (prnewswire.com)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyzon-motors-to-deliver-australias-first-hydrogen-powered-trucks-to-coregas-a-wesfarmers-company-301333282.html)

&#x200B;

and if you follow the stock, they announce new partnerships like every week. Price targets are all over the place, but average seems to be about \~$20. They just went public through an SPAC and are on a downtrend, but I feel like that always with these SPAC debuts. I feel like they arent treated like a real company until the SPAC stink wears off and people forget about how they used some beta cuck side door to get into the game.

Hydrogen still hasnt seen its day in the meme spotlight and I think it has the potential to coexist in memespace alongside EV's. They both will be needed for a sustainable energy future since diversification is a key part in being sustainable. blah blah, if you are still reading im happy for you, but really i stopped adding value after the links i posted.

""Ford is headquartered in the battleground state of Michigan. Michigan was won by Obama, Trump, and Biden, so there is political pressure to award larger government contracts and funding to Ford. Tesla, on the other hand, has its HQ in California. While Tesla will still earn contracts and funding, it's more politically appealing to work with Ford. For example, Biden has already driven the new Ford Lightning pick-up truck. Tell me the last time you remember a president doing a 0-60 pull in an electric vehicle manufactured by Tesla.""

Today, Biden is hosting an event regarding the transition to electric vehicles.  Ford and GM were invited.  Tesla wasn't.  This is a shame because Tesla is a great company, but my theory still holds.  Tesla will get funding, but they won't get all the positive PR that Ford and GM will get.

8/2/21 22:27,"Rolling TSLA Gamma Strategy 200x by October A big trade idea, a little longer term and a rare opportunity for something huge. So first off, I've been in this trade since Friday, and my fault for not at least posting before this morning, I meant to finish writing this last night. But it's a longer term strategy and one day should not derail the overall goal. 

So here's the deal. I've been waiting on this trade almost all of this year.  I rarely trade TSLA or popular meme stocks in general. But there's a trade setting up that is similar to the rolling QQQ trade from 2020. First I want to say this trade only sees it's true potential when there's a prolonged move for an asset in either direction at almost a straight line, which is very rare in equities. 

Taking a step back, another requirement for this trade to come to fruition is that the general bull market in equities continues higher from this point. Length and magnitude don't have to be too large, but another couple months, and another 250 S&P points or so is required.  

With the backdrop of a continuing bull market, by which the case can be made for many reasons I won't go into here, and what I'm about to lay out, now is the time to enter an 8-10 week trade, using a **specific rolling weekly strategy on TSLA,** beginning this morning.

In parabolic bull markets, and specifically in individual names and leaders of those bull markets, proportional growth ratios become a big part of the price action leading into the acceleration phases. One can argue that TSLA itself is the clear leader of this particular bull market, the original meme stock flag-bearer, arguably sharing the title with the likes of AMD.

Taking an outside look at the growth patterns of TSLA's stock during this historic bull run, TSLA shows the most defined fractal pattern, indicating constant proportional growth near the ratio of the golden mean.. than any other leaders. And that makes sense given that it represents this bull market as a whole. Attached are some representations of this growth rate and it's respective pattern. It doesn't need to be complicated.

Given this rare setup, I think the rally to 900 will be almost linear and weekly call options beginning with 8/6 will return over 1000%. At which point **1/3 of total proceeds will be rolled into 8/13 before close Friday.**  This strategy will allow for the errant negative week to occur, or even two in a row.  The expected return on this trade by October end is in the order of 200x original trade size.  It sounds crazy.  I'll explain it more in a bit.



Given the set up has reached maturity, and with the assumption that the S&P continues it's bull run over the next 8-10 weeks, and given whom I consider it's sister company leading this bull market, AMD, already made it's own linear run through all time highs.. as well as others like SQ approaching new highs today on acquisition news or NVDA's recent run to substantial new highs. I'm making the assumption that TSLA will continue it's bull run after a 6 month consolidation, and make new highs which by definition are above 900. 

I think the new rally will peak at about $1350. These are all signs & indications of a blow-off top phase of a general bull market that could last any range of timeframes, but as we've seen some of the most amazing moves in equities can happen during these times, and this trade hones in on one specific move that will be looked at in the context of a bigger picture when it's all said and done. The time and opportunity to make a trade like this is now.  More perfect would have been this morning. But if the thesis is right, the move will be nearly linear and there won't be many opportunities for a pullback.

**Enter for 8/6 to start the roll.   740c**

**Looking for TSLA to close the week out about $805**
