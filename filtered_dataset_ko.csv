1/28/21 14:00,"Call your brokerage and demand compensation for today’s outage! I got $200+ from TDA! I tried unloading AMC at open today to go balls deep into GME (using TDAmeritrade’s ThinkOrSwim) and what do you know...they weren’t working for about 30 minutes. 

I left Robinhood because they always crashed....seeing this happen with TDA and all the other brokerages is highly suspicious as I’ve NEVER had an issue after the first minute or so after market open. 

They have no issue collecting fees on option trades, but when their shitty service breaks for 30 minutes they take zero responsibility.

My position was fucked around $450 and they cut me a credit for almost half the amount at $200+.

I reached out via the the Chat App within ThinkOrSwim and you better believe I took screenshots and videos when nothing was working for proof. 

All these brokerages are acting “suspicious” like we’re criminals because WE LIKE THE STOCK! I feel like they’re out to get us and they have to pay (literally) for screwing us over - give them a call or send them a message if you lost $ due to their outages!",149,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.894654572,True

1/29/21 01:58,"Eastman Kodak Co. (NYSE: KODK) Let me Tell you a Story My father worked for Eastman Kodak for almost all of his adult life.  He starved to death in hospice care because of a brain tumor that made it difficult for him to understand what was going on and due to the pandemic the hospital was unwilling to operate.  


Now his Kodak stuff is my Kodak stuff.  My father and every father who lived in the Rochester, NY area was told that if they got a job with Kodak they could work their way up and be a middle class success.  The area's economy was based around the yearly ""Kodak bonuses"" where employees would get checks in the thousands as an extra reward for their good work.  This is when families would get new cars, new living room sets, maybe that vacation to Disney that they always wanted.  


Kodak was the first to create digital photographs, but never sought to develop the technology further.  They knew that if the technology was developed it would mean the end of their film business which was massive at the time.  From the 80s onward, Kodak downsized and rightsized and did all these different sizings that left families in the dust.  Kodak bonuses disappeared over time and all my dad would talk about at the dinner table was trying to transfer within the company to avoid the next batch of layoffs.  


Kodak went bankrupt a couple years ago.  The market saw that there was blood in the water and when Kodak tried to sell some of its assets to bring in the income it needed to stay afloat the market refused.  After all those same assets will be a lot cheaper from a bankrupt company forced to sell than a non-bankrupt one.  My father was one of the lucky ones.  He transferred to a division within Kodak that ultimately got sold off as Kodak Alaris.  They're the company that makes the Kodak kiosk machines for printing within stores.  


Kodak was most recently in the news because of a deal with the Trump administration to manufacture pharmaceuticals.  Kodak has huge experience with chemicals from their photo business and has a large amount of manufacturing space that has been mothballed since the death of film.  That deal was put on hold due to suspicious stock transactions (market manipulation/insider trading), but Kodak was found to not have engaged in any illegal activity.  


I think Kodak is a promising company.  It helped build my community.  There are thousands of people in the area who have experience and training, but are stuck in subpar jobs since the Kodak collapse hoping that it returns to prominence.  We have 5 colleges in the area including a state of the art medical center that is university affiliated that can provide the medical expertise needed to help this transition process.  People just need to see Kodak as valuable again.  And if their stock started rising again I believe we would see a wave of positivity for all things Kodak and Kodak-related.  


I can provide proof for everything I've talked about.  Here is a picture of my shelf with my father's Kodak clock (which he received after working at Kodak for so many years) as well as some antique cameras I own.

1/29/21 04:58,"GME TRADING HALT NOT DUE TO ROBINHOOD, BUT CITADEL???? At this point, it sounds like almost all the retail brokers have halted buying of GME, AMC, and KOSS. Public, Stash, and Webull have said it is because their clearing broker, Apex Clearing told them too. Note Robinhood uses its own clearing broker now, Robinhood Securities. It left Apex in 2018. Some, like TD Ameritrade, do self-clearing. Although TDA also uses a separate, affiliated clearing broker similar to Robinhood in addition to self-clearing.

[https://twitter.com/Stash/status/1354839916761518083](https://twitter.com/Stash/status/1354839916761518083)

The clearing brokers are not the end of the chain. They route orders to market makers who can internalize the order (take the other side) or send it to an exchange.

It goes like this:

Retail customer places order -> Retail Broker -> Clearing Broker -> Market Maker -> 1) Internalize or 2) Exchange.

SEC Rule 606 requires all broker-dealers to report the % they route they orders to and their routing policies. For example, for September 2020 nonS&P500 (aka GME, among others) orders, Robinhood routed between 38% and 65% of its various order types (market, limit, etc) to Citadel.

[https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

TD Ameritrade and its affiliate clearing broker sends up to 40% of orders to CITADEL.

[https://www.tdameritrade.com/disclosure.page](https://www.tdameritrade.com/disclosure.page)

It's well reported that Citadel and Point72 backed up Melvin Capital on their short GME position. (Note Citadel is actually multiple companies, including the asset management company then the market making company. I'm not sure which company actually loaned money for the shorts. Wiki says the market maker is a subsidiary of the asset management company).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel\_LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC)

So this is unconfirmed speculation at this point, but is it possible Citadel told all the clearing brokers routing to it to halt buying or it would withdraw it's business? If so, that seems like clear market manipulation, especially given its interest in the short positions of Melvin.

Even so, why would it matter? Other market makers like Virtu Americas should be able to step in and take the order-flow business that Citadel won't... right?

Can anybody with time on their hands pull the Rule 606 disclosure reports for all the retail and clearing brokers and make a map to see who is involved? Then see what hedge funds are related to the various market makers? Who are the other shorts? I've only seen Melvin and Citron, but they don't have the entire short position on GME do they? The coordinated shutdown of retail buyers today certainly seems like collusion.

I actually actively trade on ThinkorSwim now and I prefer over Robinhood. After Today's event's I looked over the TOS in Robinhood I don't think a class action isn't going to go anywhere.   


 *I understand that My Account is self-directed, and so that I am solely responsible for any and all orders placed in My Account and that all orders entered by Me or on My behalf are unsolicited and based on My own investment decisions or the investment decision of My duly authorized representative or agent. Accordingly, I agree that neither Robinhood nor any of its employees, agents, principals, or representatives:*   


Robinhood will and probably claim that people are not making educated investments, but rather just following the group of people into the meme stocks, which a part of their argument for blocking buys today along with the fact that their clearing house firm couldn't process the buy requests anymore.   


  *I appoint Robinhood Financial as My agent for the purpose of carrying out My directions to Robinhood Financial in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any attendant risks with respect to the purchase or sale of securities. Robinhood Financial is authorized to open or close My Account(s), place and withdraw orders and take such other steps as are reasonable to carry out My directions.

*10. Oral Authorization. I agree that Robinhood shall be entitled to act upon any oral instructions given by Me so long as Robinhood reasonably believes such instruction was actually given by Me or My authorized agent>*  


So In this section above, I read this as the fact that Robinhood does have the right to make ""reasonable"" withdraw orders. Again, I am not a lawyer so someone smarter at legal stuff will have to figure this out for me.

Super easy to do, and didn't cost me too many trading days, though I'd be scared as hell waiting on a transfer right now. 

Anyway, this morning I was the ""proud"" owner of a 1/29 320c GME call that seemingly couldn't be sold through their website or app. I decided, what the hell, I'll call them and sit on hold all morning. Nope - some nice autist was on the line and helping me place a sell order over the phone like I was Gordon Gecko or some shit. The following is how it went down.

""I need to sell to close this 1/29 GME call, man.""

""You mean these calls that you're short?""

&#x200B;

Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, National Class Action Law Firm, Announces  Class Action Investigation Against Robinhood and Other Brokers on  Behalf of Investors of AMC and Other Stocks Who Were Prevented from  Trading

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - January 28, 2021) -  Levi &  Korsinsky, LLP, a national securities law firm that has recovered  hundreds of millions of dollars for investors, announces that it has  commenced an investigation of Robinhood and other popular retail trading  platforms on behalf of investors who invested or were prevented from  investing in AMC and other stocks pursuant to trading bans on these  stocks.

On January 28, 2021, customers of Robinhood and other  popular trading platforms claimed that they were being blocked from  purchasing shares of 

AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and other securities that are being heavily shorted by institutional investors.  

Recently,  retail investors have turned the tables on Wall Street by buying up  stocks heavily shorted by hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, causing  increased volatility and short-squeeze losses to these institutional  investors.  However, on January 28th, Robinhood announced  that retail investors could no longer purchase certain stocks and raised  margin requirements for certain securities.

The inability to  trade shares has sparked outrage across social media, as users took to  Twitter to vent their frustrations, stating:

""You can no longer buy GameStop stock on Robinhood. Ditto Nokia, AMC, and all the other stocks that had been shorted.""

Another said: ""The free market is only free until rich people lose money.""

In  response to these actions, Dave Portnoy, the founder of the sports and  pop culture blog Barstool Sports, released a series of tweets  questioning Robinhood's integrity and agenda. He called for retail  investors not to close their positions. 

On January 28, AMC was down 60% amid the Robinhood restrictions.

I'm going agaisnt the grain here, but I'm a fellow looser dropping tens of keys for years with you guys, so just inverse me, I'm a good counter indictor.

**What's going on?**

[We won... kinda](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7f95j/ladies_and_gentlemen_we_got_them/). The short squeeze and gamma squeeze both happened. Yesterday market broke. Unfortunately the real winners are big players like [BlackRock, Vanguard](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l6hm3b/they_are_now_claiming_the_wsb_of_hacking_this_is/gl1xjzh/?context=3).

To avoid it all going in flames Market Makers and then Clearing Houses (new things to learn for you I know) the real players just decided to excercise their contracts and require full deposits from their clients (the small fries like WebBull and Robinhood).

Have they not do that GME would be already orbiting Mars, not Moon. Fucking Mars. Wait no, fuck Mars, it'd be orbiting Pluto.

The problem is with the infinite squeeze is ... nothing is fucking infinite. Sure you can *say* that the potential for losses for shorts is infinite, except when you are over 100% of losses and you are a corporation, the worst that happens is you close the door, and put up a sign saying ""fuck you. sue me"". You must understand that. We've liquidated few funds, we'll liquidate few more, but in the end there's simply not enough shares to go around.

**Ok. So what's going to happen?**

Next week price will go up. Definitely 🚀🚀🚀 to the stratosphere(1000+), maybe 🚀🚀🚀 to the Moon(5000+), unlikely 🚀🚀🚀 to Mars (10k-20k).

Then the real players: Vanguards, BlackRock will start dumping mass amount of shares.

Now listen to this. Did you ever wonder how 130% short interest was created?

Alice has 1 share of GME. Bob comes and borrows a share, and then immidietly sells it to the Celine. Celine then lends it to Daniel, who then goes areound and immidietly sells it again to Edgar. Voila: 200% short interest out of 1 share with no naked short selling.

**BUT** it works the other way too. Short seller Bob, buys a share because he has to, swallows a loss, but you know what? now he has a share, a share that's going up, so he waits one day and sells it for a profit ... to short seller Daniel, who turns around and does the same thing. Unwinding two shorts. Those two shorts still need to be returned .. eventually, but they can play the momentum as well as you do. So even getting their opsions excercised is not the end for them,

It takes days to unwind those kind of trades, that's why this squeeze will take days if not weeks.

So should you 💎🙌 to win? You'd think that  [Red is You](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l75z1d/volkswagen_short_squeeze_from_2008_the_red_is_you/)  look numbers even match up! The problem is that GME is not going back to 200 or 300 at which you bought in. It's going back to 20-40 in few months (yea, yea, shitron, they are right the timing is just off, which is the same as being wrong).

Now the hedge funds will get liquidated, sooner or later, if not on GME then on the next meme stock. But they do not **only** short. They als ohave long positions, those positions will get liquidated - that's why APPL is selling off among other things. What does that mean?

Wide market selloff. Markets **will** go down, and those people that invest in APPL do have stop losses. The stop losses will trigger, market will go down more.

**Ok retard so what should I do**?

*You're playing casino with disposable money*? 💎🙌 till Mars

My sense is that GME was being massively shorted despite it being relatively healthy on the books because it's obviously doomed. They've had years to move into a new field and constantly failed. Look at Kongregate, they bought that and for years idled with it. Look at Miniclip vs Kongregate. 

And what I wanted to ask you clowns is what would actually fix GME? My thoughts:

My drug induced best guess is Gamestop will become Redbox. In dummy words: Gamestop will shut down physical large stores and sell games from vending machines due to increased digital sales. Gamestop used to be the place dad would go to have some smart nerd tell him which game to buy the kid so dad can see his mistress Yulia more often. Now it's literally just a smelly box with games.

So why don't they buy Redbox or another company that has logistics and tech to distribute games everywhere. There's only a handful of MUST HAVE games in any given quarter. This is a no brainer. Where is my mistake? Not enough coke?

1/30/21 07:09,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 29, 2021 after market close) * After a hiatus due to GME craze, reeeeecaps are back for a limited time. The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

These are the same people that colluded with Charter Communications back in the day, in what is fondly called “the Summer of Love”. They’ve been able to charge us monopoly prices by divvying out the map and deciding to only provide cable in certain areas of the map, so if you’re in those areas you have one little choice. This allows them to make the price anything they way. Although we have Netflix and slightly more cable options, till this day our internet and broadband providers are 10x slower and 10x more expensive than countries like South Korea. They have no business telling us that we’re doing is immoral or criminal!! Especially when we take down evil suits named Melvin *spits out of respect*.

All throughout this, CNBC seemed to be the main perpetrator of the hedge fund narrative because they are the worst of the worst and defend establishment assholes like themselves. There is nothing else to that. I worked there for a year and it was all psychopaths. Straight up. End of story.

Anyway, I think we all hate Fox, CNN, OAN, and all that other BS but if you still take CNBC seriously, I hope this experience changes that for you. May they rot in hell.

1/30/21 18:29,"Combinations of letters are a form of art. Art is subjective. I know billionaires like to collect art and flaunt their collection in fortune magazine. Things like paintings and sculptures by Picasso, Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons and other celebrated artists.  Things that they see beauty in that, perhaps, others subjectively disagree on.  

Anyway I think its mind-blowing what I've put together, but it's a different kind of art - I'm obsessed with ticker symbols. When I go to my brokerage, I see museum quality and beyond, incredible ticker symbols that I see as art - ones you just don’t find in everybody's brokerage.

When it comes to buying a random combination of letters, I am purely from the gut and I know right away. If it stays in my brain—let’s say I go see a ticker, if I keep thinking about it, I know it’s something I like. If I forget about it, then I know, couldn’t care less...

My collection doesn't includes signature, quintessential works of sought-after tickers - I just like certain letter combinatuons. 

You know what a perfect day is for me? A perfect day is going down to Vanguard, or Fidelity, or if I'm slumming it Robinhood, and I just look at letter combinations and then grab lunch—to me, perfect day.

While I almost never sell at a profit, the investing aspect of letter combinations has never been part of the allure of collecting for me—I do not approach it the way I buy physical disks of video games, or sell them when I'm done playing them to recoup value...

I probably enjoy looking at letter combinations that I appreciate more than one that I don't appreciating.  But I don’t think the financial part is a big part of it. I don't like to make mistakes.

You can’t collect random letter combinations at my level for losses over many years and not have a real passion for it—at the end of the day, it’s not going to change my life financially.

1/31/21 09:53,"Stop Overlooking Kodak Listen up retards, I know you have a short attention span so I’ll make this quick:  

Kodak originally skyrocketed when news of a government $765m loan was announced to kick start them into becoming a pharmaceutical company during the midst of the pandemic. Yes, yes, I know.. Kodak seems like the company trying to jump on the bandwagon.. a cryptocurrency in 2017, and now pharma in 2020? Anyway, it retraced most of its gains when the SEC opened up an investigation on wrongdoing related to expected insider trading.  

 \-About a month and a half ago, the conclusion was made that there was no wrongdoing related to insider trading, the loan, etc. Now, that doesn’t mean it will still go through, but it certainly doesn’t mean it won’t. Kodak has made several announcements they will be getting into Pharma whether or not the loan goes through. With covid still looming, I don’t see what would have changed regarding the loan and with the original announcement being mid last year, an update MUST be coming regarding Kodak & pharma. 

 \-The market cap is only 700 million dollars. (Micro cap) This is minuscule, it’s less than the amount of money the government was going to give them, and is why Kodak went up so much when it was announced -Its literally more than the company was even worth! Market cap is important because it means Kodak has the potential to increase heavily over its current share price of \~$9.60. The higher the market cap, the more money required for a stock price to increase. For example, People are buying Nokia which already has a 30 billion market cap- that’s not going anywhere significant with nothing significant happening presently. 

 \-Relatively high short interest of 25.5% as of last week. This could spark a huge run. If price gets out of control, it would force shorts to cover. It’s obviously not one of the very top shorted companies, but it’s up there and with explosive price action Kodak is known to have, shorts seem to probably expect this by now. Once it breaks the current resistance it may fly catching the shorts off guard. 

 \-Huge bullish flag/pennant technical setup is primed to breakout. Check the longer term chart.  🚀 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

AAPL earnings were last week and they were spectacular, sales up 21% YOY, SMASHED 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 111.4 billion, sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 0.01% for mac revenue (mac revenue still up 21% YOY). Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.

But what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell off straight afterwards. It's why only the retardiest of retards play earnings. They almost always recover after said sell off and If you look at the chart, apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the Extremely bullish Batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday.

https://imgur.com/gallery/KCjZdbZ

The reason I believe the recovery will be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.

Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the world’s early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to 4.60. We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.

Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

2/3/21 14:54,"Banks rigged GME to stop the infinity squeeze and are now trying to get WSB to buy silver so they can make up their losses, proof included Wall St. rigged GME to prevent the infinity squeeze. This is a fact. 

They are actually trying to do the same with silver because banks have a massive net short position, proof included.

[This shows](https://twitter.com/Laowai_Koala/status/1356603457424171015?s=20) the massive net short position that banks have in the silver futures market.  And if you want to look it up yourself you can [right here.](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f)

Wait, banks are massively short silver in the futures market?  Yes

Your title bashed silver though? Yes, it’s the only way to post about silver right now. Forgive me WSB gods.

You want me to sell GME and go into silver? No. Hold your GME and go to the moon if that’s your play.  While GME is the current religious level obsession of WSB, there are people who are still interested in other plays. We’re not your enemy, WSB used to be a place where people could pitch all kinds of trades and bulls and bears made fun of each other but didn’t try to ban one another. 

There is a lot of disinformation going around that somehow silver is being pushed to help the hedge funds and banks recover losses from GME or something, but that directly conflicts with their massive net short interest in the silver futures market.

Further, silver has gapped down several times over the past year and there was never a peep from regulators.  Over the weekend all physical silver bullion from retailers completely sold out and Monday saw silver massively gap up. That night the CFTC raised margin requirements and today silver plunged. 

When it’s speculative longs buying silver and banks shorting silver, it’s the longs who were forced to sell today when margin requirements were raised.  Banks have essentially unlimited liquidity so a margin raise doesn’t affect them like it does speculators who are individuals.  

This is why for the short squeeze to work we need futures traders who won’t use their margin to max out long positions. Drastically cut back your leverage or don’t use it at all. Hold the cash you need to actually buy the silver at expiration, and then take physical delivery.  The shorts won’t be able to get enough silver to satisfy the contracts and will be left scrambling and silver prices absolutely soaring.

The silver short squeeze is an entirely different animal than GME, but it’s pretty obvious from the public data on net positioning by banks, and the immediate regulator action to the surge in price, that this is another case of retail vs corrupt wall st. banks.  

Silver surfers are fighting the same battle you are but in a different market and with bigger opponents. The trade appeals to a broader audience than just WSB though as there are doomer boomers who have been ranting and raving about this day for the last 2 decades who are also willing to dump their money into exposing the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.",24747,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.638177633,True

2/4/21 22:46,"Our state Reps actually do have our interests at heart regarding the HF evildoers. Here's a response from mine. We can make change. So I decided to put down my banana and sign a message for my handler to deliver to my state Rep. Didn't expect to have a response, but just got this in. This has been suggested before here, so be like Koko, don't throw shit, relay your concerns like the cultured apes we are.

""Thank you for writing to me with your concerns regarding the trading of stocks like GME and AMC. Your thoughts on these important matters are most welcome and appreciated.

As you mentioned, after an unexpected surge in gains for stocks such as GME, certain financial services institutions and trading platforms suspended the trading of this and other stocks on January 28, 2020. These trading restrictions have since raised questions regarding the legality of barring smaller, retail investors from participating in stock trading during periods of volatility. Like you, I have serious concerns about brokerage platforms putting in place restrictions, which limit the free trading of stocks and options, especially when those restrictions disproportionately benefit large hedge fund operators at the expense of individual investors.

In recent years, online brokerage platforms have made the stock market more accessible to individual retail investors. While this progress is important in allowing everyday Americans the freedom to make their own investment decisions, it's important that these platforms allow their users to participate on an equal playing field with the large banks, funds, and institutional investors that have dominated the stock market for decades.

You may be interested to know that I am a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. Given that this subcommittee is responsible for funding the operations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), I have a unique opportunity to engage with this agency on recent market volatility. In the coming weeks, I look forward to the opportunity to question the SEC Chair on the handling of this situation and will keep your concerns in mind as I have those discussions. The SEC must help provide answers to the thousands of retail investors who may have been harmed by the surprise restrictions put in place on January 28th. ""

2/4/21 16:01,"GME simple explanation This is very simple, for all the hype it’s easy to explain exactly what happened and what’s happening. Nikola, a company who has never produced a product and is widely believed to be outright fraud has a marker cap of ~$8.3B as of Feb 3rd, 2021. GameStop, a company with ~40k employees in the growing industry of video games has a market cap of ~$6B. A few months ago a dynamic businessman, Ryan Cohen bought millions of shares of GameStop, and then joined the board with other former Chewy executives (an online pet supply store worth ~$40B). People who had long believed GameStop has more value than the market was giving it (a low of ~$250M total market value at one point), along with new people who now saw potential in this businesses turn around, bought stock in the business. That should be the end of the story.

It’s because hedge funds on Wall Street have again been so greedy that they risked the entire United States financial system. See, these hedge funds “shorted” the stock, 140%. How can you have 140% of an entire companies stock? You can’t but they did. And the risk, which they never considered in their infinite wisdom, is infinite losses. Infinite losses? Yes, a stock price can go to $0 and the shareholders lose all their money and the company is bankrupt. But a stock has no top dollar amount, and when you’re short a stock, you bet it goes to 0, but if you’re wrong it can go as far up as any stock has ever gone for any reason. A good reason would be, the stock went up for fundamental reasons but the short positions couldn’t unwind because you can’t undo 140%, you could only undo 100%. Therefore, in using market manipulation to drive a company into bankruptcy they were suddenly faced with infinite losses, something that would send catastrophic ripples through the financial industry.

So, Robinhood. We all thought they were cool but like Facebook they’re fucking evil because they’re free, so instead of paying $6 a trade we pay $0, which was cool until last week when we found out that in spite of their name Robinhood, they are actually in the business of selling financial data to hedge funds. They take your trade order, and let the hedge funds know so their High Frequency Trading can arbitrage pennies on every trade by “beating” it to the order, millions of times a day. Ok, fuck us millennials, ok yeah but also, a little consumer protection, maybe? Ok - this is where it gets fucked.

What we learned Thursday is that Wall Street and the stock brokers do not have America’s interest their interest is to hedge funds and banks. Trading was restricted, whether it was Robinhood, the brokers, the Market Makers, we may never know but it’s not that important because it reveals that the system is fundamentally and structurally aligned to protect the few existing billionaires against Americans interest. This is a fatal sin against our democratic capitalism and risks everything we stand to be.

Moreover, they did it for a reason, the same people that control our stock markets, the barons of our nations wealth, also risked destroying them with infinite losses. How do you cover -140% to infinity? This would alter the value of every equity in America, so they shut it down.

Now, as we try to piece this together, one wrong is repairing the damage done to individual investors but the bigger change needs to be structural, prosecuting the criminals we allow to run our economy and rebuilding an equitable market to allow the American dream to prosper.

2/5/21 03:35,"You're an idiot if you don't have some WKHS in your stable Positions: 55 shares @ $36.22 (Not a big position, but whatever, it's what I could afford.)

The Low-Down:

Workhorse ($WKHS) is an EV commercial truck manufacturer primed to moon. They're one of the finalists for the $6 billion USPS contract to replace the old, outdated postal trucks with shiny, new, sexy trucks. This contract was supposed to be awarded in December but got delayed. We can expect the results within the next month.

The two other finalists are Karsan, a truck manufacturer from TURKEY and OshKosh/Ford who are putting up an ICE truck (but have said they could pivot to an EV if required).

Now, the contract itself isn't for an EV truck however adding fuel to the fire (acid to the battery?) in support of WKHS is that Biden wants the entire federal fleet to be zero emission. This is great news.

Also, WKHS is based in Ohio, American made and a union company. If your pecker isn't half chubbed and saluting at those words, then honestly you're a pinko commie un-Murrican bastard. And you can bet your ass that is being factored into the decision as to who to award. You really think that they're going to give this money to the Turks? No, this administration knows it has to pay at least lip service to American manufacturing and union support. And honestly, as Americans, that's shit that we should be supporting, too.

Their debt is around 70 million right now, which pales in comparison to the money they'll be getting if (when) they get the USPS contract.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and their short interest (SI) is around 27%, which you idiots who got spoiled @ >100% may scoff at, but is still pretty high in the normal world.

TL;DR - Don't be an idiot and sleep and WKHS. It's a great long-term play but I also believe it has potential for healthy short term gains.

EDIT 2: To put forth the other argument for why the OshKosh/Ford truck could beat out WKHS, so you see the other side of the argument: both OshKosh and Ford already have their tenterhooks in the government and definitely could win the contract. Also, as an astute person pointed out: the USPS currently doesn't have the infrastructure to support a full EV fleet, meaning that OshKosh/Ford's offering may be an easier transition. 

However, I don't think these necessarily weaken WKHS's position at all. Granted, I could be putting WAY too much stock in a cynical/political POV with this, but the way that I see it is that the contract is going to be 'weaponized' to be about more than just replacing the aged USPS fleet and will instead be something to tout as a green victory for the administration. Which I believe is overall a great step in the right direction and something we all should be happy about but let's be honest: decision makers understand optics and a PR release that says ""USPS moving their entire fleet to 0 emissions"" will play a lot better than ""USPS adopts new truck. Plans to move to 0 emissions by 2030""",26579,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.891462147,True

The mods need to assign (if not themselves) a group of fucking kongs that know their shit inside and out and can post/edit information that no person can possibly doubt.

The post needs to center around one objective:  

The second wave.


The nature of the post should give everyone everything they need to fully understand what is going on, why and what needs to happen.  Most importantly,  legit information that supports this theory of a second wave without tripping anything that could be seen as illegal.

It’s a thread supporting a theory, not advice, not what to do, not what we should do.  Simply supporting the theory of a second wave.

Having a post that is constantly updated with a time stamp update in the subject helps remove doubt and the spread of mis/disinformation.   Proving/explaining things such as ladder attacks and theoretical solutions for it let alone creative solutions that the community talks about but only sees it for a few hours (and is 100% legit) get added.  The community is encouraged to send vital information only that is scrubbed for legitimacy.  Finally, it needs to be organized and it needs to provide information to help understand other complex information.  Most importantly, the greatest service this post can offer is when it’s time to call it.  This does a great service to everyone late and uninformed and those that need to salvage what they can.  This is how you fix things.

I didn't put in a lot, no more than I could afford to lose. As of now I've lost, maybe it's over, maybe it's not. What I have left is sitting there waiting to see. I'm not worried, it's been fun, it's been exciting, hell probably the most excitement I've had since this whole lockdown crap. 

I've learned a lot, not so much about stocks but about people. I've learned that theres people on both sides of things that just want to rag on someone who's worse off than they are. I guess it makes them feel superior. I don't let them get to me. In fact I feel bad for them. It must suck to be that unhappy.

I learned that a common enemy really does bring people together. In hopes of fighting the dishonesty wall street. I saw people or all races, ethnicities, orientations, and political & social views come together. It was an American thing in the start but when it seemed the shorters were winning I saw people from Austria, Germany, Canada, Korea Japan, New Zeland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and more not only give words of support but their money to keep things going.

I saw good things happen, I saw a 15 year old kid take his 3k and make 250k and pull his profit to pay for college. I saw a 10 year old kid get rich from a gift his mom gave him years ago. I saw a man find out his dog needed life saving surgery and because of his profit he could do it. I saw a guy donate nintindo switches (a lot of them) to St Judes. I saw someone buy tendie lunches for all the workers at Gillette childrens healthcare.  I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I saw so many reports of good things! People helping people with their winnings.

Was it worth it even if I never recoup my money? Hell yes! It's great to see so many people come together despite their differences. To see so many good things come out of it. Were there greedy people involved, sure. Were there some who stepped on others, sure. Happens everywhere, but it's not always balanced with the good. It's nice to be reminded of the good.

Notice how **California**  is grey ? What do you think is gonna happen when the tech bros in San Fran get their hands on mobile sports betting ? What do you think is gonna happen when the frat boys and sorority sluts in Los Angeles and San Diego are gonna get their hands on it ? They're gonna gamble on their favorite teams like it's Las fucking Vegas. Hell now that you've imagined that, imagine what would happen **when motherfucking Texas** legalizes sports betting. Do you even know how crazy those Texans are about sports ? 

It should be noted that while **New York has legalized sports betting,** you can't bet using a mobile app right now, but Cuomo has been hinting about getting to that sometime soon. And that is gonna be massive.

Need I say more my fellow retards ? 

Mark my words, 2021 is the year of sports betting. **It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.**

Hop on this rocket as it is fueling up and enjoy the ride.

KURSRAUSCH BEI GAMESTOP:Robinhood verkauft Daten der Kleinanleger an Hedgefonds

Mit Robinhood wollten es die Kleinanleger mit der Wallstreet aufnehmen. Doch die Broker-App macht Geschäfte mit den Hedgefonds und gibt die Nutzerdaten weiter. Beide scheffeln so Milliarden.

￼

Beim Angriff auf die Hedgefonds nutzten Massen von Kleinanlegern die Broker-App Robinhood.

￼

Damit trieben sie etwa den Aktienkurs des US-Computerspielhändlers Gamestop in die Höhe.



Wie die Markforschungsfirma Block laut «Tages-Anzeiger» berechnet hat, soll Robinhood im vergangenen Jahr 922 Millionen Dollar mit Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändlern gemacht haben, das sind rund 40 Prozent des Umsatzes.

Darum gehts

Mit der Broker-App Robinhood trieben Kleinanleger den Aktienkurs von Gamestop in die Höhe.

Die App schien die Waffe der Kleinanleger im Kampf gegen die Wallstreet zu sein.

Doch es ist genau umgekehrt: Die App verkauft ihre Nutzerdaten an Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändler.

Dabei fliessen auf beiden Seiten Milliarden.

Es hätte David gegen Goliath sein sollen: Kleinanleger versammelten sich kürzlich in Scharen auf der Plattform Reddit, um zum grossen Angriff auf die grossen Hedgefonds zu blasen. Im Kollektiv kauften sie Aktien von maroden Firmen, um den Kurs nach oben zu treiben. Damit wollten die Anleger den grossen Investmentfirmen schaden, die mit sogenannten Leerverkäufen (siehe Box) auf sinkende Kurse setzen und damit Unsummen mit taumelnden Firmen verdienen.

Werbung

Im Fokus dieses von Kleinanlegern angezettelten Flashmobs standen die Aktien des US-Comuterspielhändlers Gamestop oder der US-Kinokette AMC. Tatsächlich schossen jene Kurse innert Kürze in die Höhe und bescherten Hedgefonds Verluste in Milliardenhöhe.

So funktionieren Leerverkäufe

Ein Leerverkäufer, auch Short-Seller genannt, leiht sich Aktien und verkauft sie umgehend. Er hofft, dass der Kurs fällt und er die Papiere zu einem tieferen Preis zurückkaufen kann. Das ist nicht unumstritten, wie Matthias Geissbühler, Investment-Chef von Raiffeisen Schweiz, zu 20 Minuten sagt. So könnten dadurch Abwärtstrends verstärkt und einzelne Firmen kaputt gemacht werden. Genau das befürchteten wohl die Gamestop-Fans.

Hedgefonds kassieren ab

Doch was auf den ersten Blick wie ein Sieg für die Kleinanleger ausschaut, ist in Wahrheit genau das Gegenteil. Zum einen sitzen nun viele Anleger und Spekulanten auf riesigen Verlusten. Denn mittlerweile ist die Aktienjagd fast vorbei und die Kurse sind teils wieder drastisch zusammengesackt. Zum anderen haben gerade die Hedgefonds mit dem vermeintlichen Angriff auf sie ebenfalls abkassiert.

Grund dafür ist die Broker-App Robinhood. Das Tool nutzten viele Reddit-User, um mit Aktien wie Gamestop und AMC zu handeln und den Angriff auf die Hedgefonds zu planen. Die Transaktionen sind mit der App gratis, da keine Gebühren verlangt werden. Die App schien die Waffe der Kleinanleger gegen die Mächtigen der Wallstreet zu sein. Doch auch hier zeigt sich: Es ist gerade umgekehrt, wie der «Tages-Anzeiger» schreibt.

Robinhood verkauft Nutzerdaten

Denn auch Robinhood muss Geld verdienen. Und das tut die App gerade mit den Hedgefonds sowie computerbasierten Hochfrequenz-Händlern – und damit mit den Feindbildern der Kleinanleger. So knöpft Robinhood den Kleinanlegern zwar keine Gebühren ab, dafür aber deren Nutzerdaten. Diese verkauft sie den Hedgefonds.

Die App gibt den grossen Investoren so Einblick in die Handelsaufträge der Kleinkunden, bevor der Auftrag abgewickelt ist. «Damit können diese professionellen Händler blitzschnell die Differenzen zwischen den Kauf- und Verkaufspreisen ausnutzen und Milliardengewinne machen», schreibt die Zeitung weiter.

Busse von 65 Millionen Dollar

Das Geschäft mit den Kundendaten soll die grösste Einnahmequelle für die App sein. Wie die Markforschungsfirma Block laut «Tages-Anzeiger» berechnet hat, soll Robinhood im vergangenen Jahr 922 Millionen Dollar mit Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändlern gemacht haben, das sind rund 40 Prozent des Umsatzes.

2/6/21 09:37,"Current DD on GME and the liquidity of the share The retail investors have an impact. Otherwise, GME would already be back at $5.
Stocks and buy & hold. Still the best DD. Nothing has changed since that perfect DD from weeks ago.  Shorts are not covered or only partially covered.

The GME DD from weeks ago already said that they will try everything to manipulate. Media, price and also your morale. Unfortunately, they have already managed especially the latter well. Yesterday, many of you have already given up.

But the fact is: If we continue, they will have to cover everything at some point.

You see huge swings up and down despite comparatively small volume? That is due to the low liquidity of GME shares. There are few shares available as most are holding. Therefore, small purchases / sales have a very strong impact on the price. Google liquidity in the stock market or read Gerd Kommer's books.

For example, someone in this sub has shown on the chart how a shortseller during a ""ladder attack"" was able to lower the price by over $100 with only 250 million capital. (Stoploss triggered etc.).

Today it was even more extreme. With a few thousand shares you could lift/press the price by 10% in no time.

All this speaks for the low liquidity and thus for the fact that the squeeze is still possible.

TL;DR: Buy & Hold. As said from the beginning.

Thanks to  [u/yimiemie](https://www.reddit.com/user/yimiemie/) for making me aware of this stock back at $6.67. It mooned, as he projected.

**What is Himax**

 “Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: HIMX) is a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. Himax is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, Himax designs and provides controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, scaler products for monitors and projectors, tailor-made video processing IC solutions, silicon IPs and LCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and heads-up displays (HUD) for automotive.

Himax has 3,009 patents granted and 561 patents pending approval worldwide as of December 31st, 2020. Himax has retained its position as the leading display imaging processing semiconductor solution provider to consumer electronics brands worldwide.” 

**Q4 ER**

They smashed it. Oddly, the company released pre ER Q4 data and everyone just ignored the great news because of reasons. Then Q4 came and their guidance added fuel to the hot numbers. 

From the ER press release:

"" Q1 2021 Guidance: Revenue to increase by 5% to 10% sequentially, Gross Margin is expected to be 37% to 38%, IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.0 cents to 34.0 cents, and Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.1 cents to 34.1 cents.""

They are telling you they'll moon. Telling you!

**Semiconductor constraints, right? AMD, right?**

Again, from the horse's mouth:

""Have **succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021** as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. Expect the **total capacity available to Company to increase quarter by quarter in 2021 and will continue efforts in acquiring more capacity**. Also **secured a meaningful capacity increase is automobile where the global shortage for semiconductor supply is overwhelming**.""

So the company won't face the same constraints. Actually, they'll have more capacity.

**Who are their customers**

Samsung, LG, Lenovo, Huawei, Panasonic, Amazon, Sony, Mercedes, Jaguar, Asus, FOXCONN (come on), Google, and so many more.

**Catalysts**

Do you need more than their 2021 guidance? It's not secret the world is going EV. It's also no secret EV uses large displays instead of dinky nobs. Put 1 and 1 together.

**Value**

 HIMX trades at a big discount to its industry at 1.5X forward 12-month sales vs. 5.1X. (from Zack's). This was when the stock was $9.90. Going by their math, to get to the industry average, the stock should have a price point of $33.66.

Yeah, there's still room.

**Positions**

2/8/21 05:24,"MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I’m gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there’s more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,

Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I’m sure you’ve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol’ USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the “betting” portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I’m starting top down with this masterpiece. 

Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. 

Karsan - I can’t see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it’s a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. 

Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was “zero-emission”. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they’ll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren’t all that practical or possible. 

The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there’s no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‘87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. 

Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy’s current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven’t noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don’t see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they’re gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that’s currently burning cash like it’s their fucking job. 

THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. 

Enough about the contract though, let’s talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn’t talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there’s a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). 

Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she’s grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she’s not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. 

Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there’s another form of revenue the company has going for it. 

It’s a growth stock with a lot of potential and it’s logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. 

Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I’ve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there’s plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that’s why we’re all here right? 

Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16. 

Let’s ride this horse to tendy town fellas 🤝

Edit: I’m a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah

EDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.

Edit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.

2/10/21 07:44,"Yesterday, if you followed my advice on TLRY you'd be up 100% in 24 hrs. Today, let’s talk about WKHS & OSK. (xpost r/options) **TL;DR: OSK to the moon 🚀🚀🚀, WKHS to hell 👎👎👎**

WKHS is at all time highs, and Reddit loves to pump the stock. Me? I was one of the biggest workhorse bulls with hundreds of shares in my portfolio. I rode the wave until today, where I sold the last of my shares. So... why?

Well, **90% of this company‘s value is based on them getting the USPS deal. People love to think the company is a shoe in for the USPS deal, but that’s simply not the case.**

For starters, the Biden administration doesn’t have nearly as much control over the United States Postal Service as you think. See: https://twitter.com/bradplumer/status/1354831900939079680?s=20
Even if Biden‘s number one goal was for the USPS to go all electric, he’d have to move hell and earth to have any control over that happening. And, with the contract supposedly being decided by the end of March, there simply isn’t enough time to do that.

But it gets even worse. People say “well, workhorse is the only all electric option, so at least it has that going for it.“ To that, I Bring you a conversation an analyst had with Oshkosh:

> “Your bid is based on the Ford's transit, I believe. And we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021. For your comment that you can address whatever the USPS' needs are as far as powertrain, is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit? Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?”

Oshkosh’s reply: 

> “So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.”

In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all-electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special.

Let’s get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed). **Buy mountains of WKHS puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you’re brave like me, calls expiring in April.**

For those of you kids who can’t read good, I’ll put the **TLDR** right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it’s almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don’t mean by a little bit… I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  **A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00**  I’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it’s trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at <3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be <1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!

You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  


**FINANCIAL METRICS & PEER COMPARISONS**

KT’s balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  


Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:

https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg


Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):

Compared to industry peers/comps:

https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg


The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, **it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.**  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real **deep fucking value.**

Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%.

Everyone looks for the **TLDR** at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:

Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets.

2/11/21 05:29,"WKHS USPS contract BLUF: I am long WKHS and believe American-made EV should be the new USPS mail truck. Long time commenter, first time DD’er; and I am not sorry about my lack of emoji inclusion in this DD. This is for pure autistinal personnel.

This is my take on a lot of DD going around WKHS. This is NOT an explanation of a possible short squeeze or how we will ‘stick to the HFs’. Fuck that I’m just trying to pass along my ideas and share them with y’all to get rich; if you like them great! If you don’t, great, but also fuck. This is also not technical analysis. I can make another post with my cup and handle patterns and bull flags showing up everyday indicating bullish trends but I really believe that you cannot use TA to predict the USPS. Sources for technicals are at the bottom.

WKHS price in the short term is almost entirely dependent on the USPS contract. They (the USPS) have been pushing back and pushing back the deadline to make the announcement on who gets USPS’s $6bb contract and hopefully we are approaching the finish line based off a board of governor’s meeting that occurred this week. Publicly there is no break-out candidate but WKHS is one of three, but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the USPS fleet (~165,000 vehicles). The other finalist, Oshkosh, is teaming up with Ford, but their submission is still an ICE which does NOT meet the request and intent of the president’s Zero-Emission initiative. Let’s pause and talk about Biden and the USPS for a second and I’ll put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately:
    -Biden wants to electrify the entire US government fleet
    -Biden wants to the fleet to be 100% AMERICAN made vehicles
    -F is not 100% american made (something like only 64%, and even less for their future EV)
    -OSK/F’s submission is an ICE (they are planning EV but it was not their submission to the USPS contract bid)
    -WKHS is 100% manufactured in the USA
    -WKHS specializes in EV delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players
    -WKHS has patents and improvements to ‘last-mile’ delivery

But even with all that info, some may still push for an OSK/F vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government. Let’s talk about that: OSK has a relationship with the military to make Humvee’s and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes. But this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the USPS decision. The USPS is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government. Who is in charge of that branch? Exactly. (That is why Trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the USPS and vote-by-mail, but not the time for this discussion). The USPS is also a for-profit agency AND RECEIVES NO DIRECT TAXPAYER FUNDING, but continues to operate at a loss. The USPS spent $706.2mm maintaining their fleet of shitty ICE clunkers in FY2019.

Short of Elon Musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the ISS via First Class Mail, what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely EV. The USPS MUST reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive:
    -ICE repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.028
    -EV repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.012
    -Total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using EV: ~$4600

The USPS is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a Postmaster General. They operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses. It is imperative for the USPS to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery. Which brings us to another point: Last Mile Delivery.

Last Mile Delivery accounts for more than 53% of total shipping cost. Last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep (literally where USPS operates). It costs $10.10 to deliver a package to your door, but USPS is charging $8.08. So they are already operating a loss. Why is this so expensive?
1) Lower average speed + more time on the road = fewer mpg
2) More stops leads to more idling and more downtime
3) My neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up “to get exercise” = way more time for delivery


The first two of these issues are solved with WKHS. WKHS EV will reduce mpg cost (duh) but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain. Seriously, look up the Workhorse Horsefly. The third issue I will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape.

With all this being said it’s obvious that I feel that WKHS is the obvious choice, but who knows what the board of governors is thinking. Below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard:

Scenario One: 40% chance: WKHS earns the entire contract. Someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars WKHS would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced.

Scenario Two: 30% change: The contract is split up between Oskosh and WorkHorse. In the initial documentation before Biden's 100% green energy plans, the USPS wanted 75% electric 25% gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75% and Oskosh gets 25%. Others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time. Even with only 10% of the contract awarded to WKHS you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day.

Scenario Three: 20% chance: They can’t come to a decision and push it back until next quarter. This has happened already two times. They were first supposed to decide this summer, but they pushed it back to December. In December they failed again and pushed it back to latest March 31st. If this happens, the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement.

Scenario Four: 10% chance: OSK wins the contract. Oskosh is an awesome company, they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us Humvees for the military. They are respected and reliable, however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law can't just resubmit something else at the last minute. Especially with Biden wanting to look like he can get shit done AND after having made a statement about electrifying the US Fleet it looks insanely unlikely that OSK gets the entire bid, but if this happens, the only support that won't get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level.

TLDR: WKHS should win the USPS contract and their short term viability relies on it.

My positions: 600 shares at $34 cost basis, $32C LEAPs 1/2022, $32C’s at 2/12, 2/19, 3/19
Total position is worth around 30,000 right now and about 40% of my single-registered.

2/10/21 13:38,"Why BB's Contract with Motional is Bigger than We Realise. There are already numerous posts about the news that can out today but I wanted to put this out there because I saw a common theme among the comments that a lot of people don't know how big Motional is.


https://www.techrepublic.com/article/blackberrys-qnx-to-power-motionals-driverless-vehicle-platform/


I had the same reaction until I looked them up. Motional is not some fly-by-night start-up.


1. They are a $4 Billion joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv where Hyundai put in $1.4 Billion dollars and has the backing of the South Korean government which expects them to have fleet rollout by 2024.


That means we know there's some serious intent with this company and they have the money to pay for BB's products.


https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362322/hyundai-aptiv-motional-autonomous-vehicle-joint-venture


2. Motional isn't just a concept, it has a product out on the roads right now. As of Feb last year, they already had 100k paying customers via Lyft. That's right, they already had a soft roll out. They are targetting a full self driving robotaxi service with lift in 2023.


https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/


3. On the same note, they are launching robotaxis with Via in the first half of this year. This year!


https://motional.com/press_article/motional-and-via-partner-to-launch-a-platform-for-public-on-demand-shared-robotaxi-rides/


4. Along with Amazon WS IVY partnership expecting to make bank in 2023. It seems like BB is poised for an explosion in revenues starting in 2023. Most tech companies out there are priced well into the future yet BB seems to be priced for this or next year at most. If the market can wake up to this then BB could do really well. 

This is on top of Baidu, and all the existing clients of QNX.


Those are just my own thoughts so I welcome further discussion.

2/13/21 01:02,"Complete DD on HYLN. No battery patent, no IP, no product. Nikola 2.0? Hyliion became a thing in the WSB world once again today.  I'll get to the once again part in a few.

I'm not going even gonna bother with tendies, wifes bf jokes, etc... because as you will see this company is more of a joke than I can make about it.  Also, I was in finance for over a decade, have passed Series 7 & 66 (since lapsed, so fuck you FINRA, I'm not an RR). So I have some clue what I'm talking about.

First, lets talk financials. Courtesy of their [Website](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2020/Hyliion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx)


Revenue: 0

PE: Divide by zero error


Profit Margin: Zilch

Operating Cash Flow: -11.53 million.


Net loss per share 2019: 0.45, Net Loss per share 2020: 0.76. They are burning more money faster.



**Intangable assets (IP aka patents fall under this) 356 thousand.  And somehow that went down from 2019's number of 429 thousand. If they had dope IP it would be worth more. Also the ""new battery"" isn't patented or at least mentioned here**


R & D burned 8.13 million in 2020, and Admin burned 3.7 million.



Debt almost quadrupled from 2019 to 2020




Their R&D spending went up 20% and their Admin and salaries almost doubled.

They redeemed warrants at the start of the year diluting shares and raising 142 million.  This isn't generally seen as a good thing.

**In October they joined with another shady looking SPAC called Tortoise that is (was?) based in the Caymans.  Cause the Caymans are never used for shady financial dealings right?**

Their team is lackluster at best. The CEO is inexperienced and has an undergrad in mechanical engineering. And describes himself on the site as a serial entrepreneur, which is super cringe.

The head engineer was an engineer at Dana, which is why they have some relationship with them. Otherwise nothing of note at all. **So anyone saying 'strong team' etc, hasn't even looked at the website.**

**[Other notes: The new battery system isn't patented or proprietary, and is not listed in their patents.  Which are pretty lackluster.](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/hyliion-inc)**


[I\[f you read between the lines, the press release was stating they have a new battery cooling system. That's it.](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2021/Hyliion-Introduces-Next-Generation-Battery-Module-to-Improve-Performance-and-Efficiency/default.aspx)

And how it became a thing on reddit once again: Almost a year ago when it launched, it hit $59/share, then dropped to $13 where it stayed.  It's already made bagholders on reddit with BS vaporware.  Don't let it do it again.


TL;DR any way you slice it.  Be it from a fundamentals perspective, IP/ Innovation perspective, or market sentiment perspective, this company is dog shit.  It's a SPAC like Nikola, and it's basically a less impressive dog and pony show without bad photoshops or theatrics.  Like they don't even care that much. There are no rockets in this post for a good fucking reason. If there was an bomb emoji it would be there, but for now I give it this. 💩


Position: Puts. I was gonna FOMO in, but I read the press release and it looked like shit, and the more I read the more I was sure it was shit. So much so I got puts.  The more I read the more I think its not just shit, but it's a total scam.

**Main Takeaways: Their patent portfolio is trash, the miracle battery isn't patented, they say their IP is only worth 346k, and they dump more money on admin then they do R&D**

2/12/21 19:44,"Why ""Cheap"" Asian Company ADRs Are (Almost 100%) Value Traps Hey Kimchi here with a quick message:

Am seeing a ton of Asian ADRs being shilled on here with the message being that they're cheap. Yes they are cheap, but there's a reason.

***Shitty Corporate Governance:***

I'm not completely familiar with Chinese and Japanese conglomerates (but have heard they're similar) so I'm going to focus on the Korean ones. Korean companies essentially exist for the benefit of the founder's families. Period.

People went off about corporate governance issues at Facebook and Snapchat during their IPOs due to founders controlling the company with ""only"" 22% and 36% ownership respectively... Samsung's ""owner"" controls the entire conglomerate with a 3.4% ownership stake.

[This is Samsung Group's Ownership Structure](https://preview.redd.it/jqvamel8m0h61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=41dbc7133b7a239b7f90b8c56787791b3ebf9461)

***Circular Holdings:***

A Korean company having a holding in another subsidiary isn't a good thing. It's a way for the founder to hold on to as much control of as many companies as possible with as little capital as possible.

The founder will have a stake in company A -> Company A has a stake in company B -> Has a stake in Company C -> Has a stake in Company A.

***Prices Held Down:***

Unlike the US where CEOs have bonus incentives to keep stock prices up (a different issue in and of itself), founders/CEOs in Korea have incentives to keep the price down. They want to keep the price as cheap as possible so that when they die the inheritance taxes are lower for their children. Seriously. Stock prices at these conglomerates go up when one generation of owners die as they're no longer held down.

The shit that these founders pull on shareholders make hedgefunds/wallstreet guys in the US look like saints. Nearly every founder of every major conglomerate in Korea has gone to jail for securities fraud/embezzlement/bribery. It's a shitshow.

**tl;dr:**

Don't mess with Korean stocks (or Chinese, Japanese, etc) if the only reason is ""they're cheap"". They're cheap for a reason and they will be for a long time.",32800,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999079466,True
2/12/21 18:15,"SKM undervalued. I like the stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at 15.4B. Shares should be 40$ to reflect that. Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.

SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap. Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.

Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.

Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Risk and catalyst: Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted. Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.

Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly 15.4ish Billion usd. The entire market cap for SKM listed shows 15.75B usd.

It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only 0.35B. it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.

10B + 15.4 = 25.4B I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.

Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening.

Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)

The Boussoura Project is still in its early days, yet we are growing more confident in the scale of this project, with a large land package host to numerous veined corridors running over extensive strike lengths and with numerous targets identified between Fofora and Galgouli with similar geochemistry and geophysical anomalies. We will continue to keep the drills turning at Boussoura, as we look to continue to expand and define the mineralized footprint towards the goal of a maiden resource by year end.""

This is not financial advice. Simply sharing my DD and would like to hear what you have to say about it.

  
**TLDR: I like the stock and see rocket ships in the future. Their current and future financials look very good and the calculations show that this stock is extremely undervalued by about 80%.**",32852,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.959491074,True
2/12/21 07:24,"AMKR - Amkor Technology - A Great Play in the Semi Conductor Space - CRIMINALLY Undervalued, literally can't go tits up! EDIT: So we are are almost up over 10% since I wrote this DD. Steady 3-4% both days. That is what we need, slowly ride this baby to to the moon

Been a member for about a year and seen some great DD, so about time I do one of my own. It might be a bit long, so a summary upfront:

**AMKR – Amkor Technology** \- is an undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space, which is going to be a super-hot sector in 2021 and beyond. The stock has great financials and the P/E ratio is killer, even better than any of your established boomer stocks.  The company has a market cap of 5B on revenues of $5B

This is not a get rich quick scheme or a pump and dump. Invest wisely and this one should rise gradually during the year.

Position – 16c , 3/19 and 24c 3/19 and 2k shares. I got into the stocks couple of weeks back when it was at $16

Now that is out of the way, lets get to it.

**What do you look for in a great DD:**

1. Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment
2. Financials are solid
3. Outlook is great
4. Company is a bit of an unknown and undervalued
5. There is an upcoming catalyst

Before I get into each, let me simply tell you what AMKR does. The company provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. So it works with companies that need to develop chips for your 5G phones, for your future EV Lambos. Basically it provides critical services to companies that manufacture or deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and has big players like Qualcomm, Sony, AMD etc as its customers.

So now lets get to it:

&#x200B;

1. ***Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment.***

Unless you have been hiding under the rock, semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board. This is a hot sector to be in the moment. Don’t believe me here you go:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)

[https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef](https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef)

Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon.

&#x200B;

***2.*** ***Financials are solid***

I can more with you all the details in the world, on how the company is constantly reducing it’s debt and increasing operating income or how it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends, but I am going to focus on one metric. P/E ratio.

While I was typing up this DD the P/E ratio of this company is 15.91. So is that good or bad, well to put it in context, Apple is 36.57 and Microsoft is is 36.35. Even your boomer stock PepsiCo is at 26.7.

Okay, but what about other companies in this space. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17. Another favourite of this reddit, UMC 78.63, QCOM 24.81. AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79

Like I said, that metric alone tell you how criminally undervalued this company is.  Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

&#x200B;

***3. Outlook is great:***

Well, I am not going to say much, but just copy paste the closing statement from the last earnings call:

“Okay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor’s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021”

UMC has a revenue of $5bn and a valuation of $25B which is 4X of this company!AMAT as 3.5 times the revenue and 20X the valuation

Also to recap their 2020 highlights

Full Year 2020 Highlights:

Net sales $5.05 billion, up 24.6% year on yearNet income $338 million, earnings per diluted share $1.40EBITDA $960 millionNet cash from operations $770 million and free cash flow $221 million

Sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow

Financial information on the company:

[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)

&#x200B;

***4. Company is bit of an unknown and undervalued***

I mean, come on, everyone talks about TSM, AMAT, UMC, but has anyone every mentioned this company? It is literally the definition of an unknown.

Undervalued, it is CRIMINALLY undervalued compared to it peers. Look at the P/E ratio, literally better than anyone else. Its revenue to valuation ratio, literally better than anyone else. I mean I don’t know what else to say. This speaks BUY BUY BUY!

I mean, this company should have a valuation of at least $10B, which would shoot its price past $40

&#x200B;

*5.* ***There is upcoming catalyst***

Well company just become a strong buy on Zacks, but there is a bigger catalyst coming up on Feb 16th, which is the reason for some price action today:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html)

**The company is going to join the S&P Mid Cap 400 on Feb 16th.** This is probably the reason why the stock moved so much today.

This alone will bring more capital into the company. More and more people will look into this company and realize the absurd valuation compared to its peers and yes this rill rise more. Today was just the start of what might happen over the next week

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Yes I know the stock has doubled in the last 6 months and jumped 20% today, but

1. The outlook is better than ever in company’s history
2. They delivered their best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. The financial ratios are best in class, even better than all your boomer stocks
4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today
5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space
6. There is an upcoming catalyst on Feb 16th - S&P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion
7. Another stock being mentioned here ON has the same revenue and income and is valued 3X more. if you think that is  a great play, which it is, think about this one!
8. The volume is lowish, but again I see that as a positive as this will climb quickly once there is interest. The avg volume on this stock is 1M, it was 5M today and already 700k after hours

I am balls deep on 24c, 3/19, which was looking risky two days ago, but it looks juicy as fuck now.

As always do your DD, and enjoy the tendies!

I am no financial advisor, but some guy who thinks we all can make money from this GEM

2/12/21 06:51,"$AMKR gapped up today but I think it's still undervalued Amkor is a semiconductor packaging company. Boring af. Think cardboard company selling boxes to Amazon. But they've got: 
-solid earnings track record ($1.39/s TTM)
-low PE (9.18 FWD looking)
-upward trajectory earnings estimates ($1.69/s projected this year)
-a large portion of the market share selling B2B in an industry that has been killing it for years.

I usually skip on companies that beat earnings and gap up cause I figure I missed the boat. But I think this still has room to run. They've broken out of the 20 day SMA on the news this week of an earnings beat (Monday) that they will be added to the S&P midcap 400 (yesterday). **This means index etfs will start scooping up shares.** And Citi analyst price target increases today to $15 from $13 https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amkor-technology-stock-just-jumped-again-2021-02-11

Granted it's currently trading well above that higher price target but it seems analysts are rarely willing to reach ahead of an uptrending stock, and they just follow it up with trailing estimates. What's more important is the fact that they found reason to move it at all.

2/11/21 15:57,"More $KT DD Earlier today u/clubba posted some good DD on $KT - Korea Telecom - looking at the low price/book ratio. It's a good metric to get a lead on potential value plays (LOL at WSB turning into a value stock forum, way to go DFV), but there's more to look at.

Book value tells you if the company has underlying value or if it's just a house of cards. Price to book ratio tells you *what the market thinks of that underlying value.* In this case, almost nil. A good question to ask when you see a metric that seems way too positive to pass up is, why are other people passing it up?

First, more about the company: they do mobile networks, sat TV, finance (credit cards), and infosec services. They also do some robotics cause it's fun?

Telecom was one of the worst performing sectors over the past year, by the way. This can be a positive if you're a value investor-it means the price may be depressed by the broader industry.

To the stock itself, the value play isn't as strong as the price to book makes it out to be. Again, if that tells you it has underlying value, great. But is it making any money? Price to earnings is 8 or 9 (depending if you're looking at the past year or projected), compared to 12ish for the industry, another good sign. Earnings growth projections are positive also, but not phenomenal. ~~Negatively, they did not pay a dividend last year, which is like value investor 101: show me the dividend!~~ **Correction: evidently they typically announce dividends in the spring, and backdate the ex date to the prior year, which is why no sites are showing a 2020 divided yet.** But they did announce a share buy back and a 2021 dividend. They have a comparatively small market, and have branched out internationally as a result. That can be expensive.

Tl;dr - I think there are positive signs for a long term value play, but what this company is lacking is meaningful growth. The point of investing is to make money, not just hold value.

I'm going to watch it, because if they do a spin off or some other move to position for innovation or greater market share then it could be poised to take off.",32973,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.982738912,True
2/14/21 03:01,"Oshkosh Corp. $OSK Is anyone else on the Oshkosh train in hopes they get the new deal with USPS?  You can do your own DD, but there are 3 companies left in the running for the new contract with USPS for new mail trucks. The other 2 companies have electric trucks in the running but Oshkosh has one with a diesel motor in it.  From what I’ve read more than one company may be chosen so I’m banking that they will go with an electric and gas option, which means Oshkosh would be chosen having the only combustion engine offered. There are lots of rural areas across the country where electric wouldn’t be the best option. Also, the fact that Oshkosh already has contracts with the US Government making specialty trucks and military vehicles, seems to be an added benefit. 

USPS is scheduled to make an announcement in the first quarter of this year and long calls on $OSK are still fairly cheap. Just wondering what others think about what appears to be a golden opportunity?

I’m no expert on the stock market and this is my first post here as I’m new to trading.

2/13/21 05:41,"$OSK (Oshkosh) to Infinity and Beyond (Part 1) 🚀🚀🚀 I will be writing a series of DD posts for OSK. I have included TLDRs at the beginning of the post because I know we are all illiterate and lazy autists.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 1): Oshkosh has excellent management in place with a great track record not only maintaining market share in its current sectors. It has grown every year since CEO has been put in place except for the Covid year. The OSK team has been working hard to get into the electric commercial vehicle space, and it looks promising.

Oshkosh’s Pilot will navigate us through the Stars and to the end of the Universe.

Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate that provides products to access equipment, defense, fire & emergency, and commercial sectors. It was founded in 1917. It is a business that has been around longer than the boomers we know in our lives. Since it has survived multiple recessions and depressions, it will not be going anywhere.

The CEO of the company is Wilson R Jones, and he has been with the company since 2005 as general manager and in other roles. He has been the President/CEO since 2016, and the company has seen growth year after year. This guy is like a fucking wizard that only knows how to grow. The company did take a hit in 2020, and so did basically any companies that didn’t facilitate stay at home orders and the pain of Covid (eg. Zoom). 

During Wilson’s tenure, the stock price of OSK went from around $30 to $100. This growth in stock price isn’t just due to the markets being hotter than my neighbor next door. The revenue of OSK from 2016-2019 went from 6.28B  to 8.38B, and the EBIT of OSK went from $367M to $805M. During 2020 the revenue dropped to 6.82B, and the EBIT dropped to $406M. The company took a dip, but are we really going to hold that against him? He has a track record of performing, but you can’t do anything if there is a black swan event. ([Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/financials?p=OSK))

Wilson and the OSK team aren’t satisfied with its current business sectors. They have been building relationships and joint ventures to dominate the commercial EV space. Their notable partners entering the commercial EV space are [FORD](https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/) and [Microvast](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005668/en/Oshkosh-Corporation-partners-with-Microvast-to-strengthen-electrification-capabilities). Their first mission is to swoop in and steal the USPS contract from Workhorse, like how my wife’s boyfriend stole my wife away from me. I hate that fucker. I will talk more about this later on.

The management team has a strong track record, and they are only looking up and beyond just the moon. They will navigate us through the stars and into another galaxy.

In the next post, I will talk more about the valuation given to OSK and why it is a steal even if they didn’t plan on providing electric commercial vehicles for USPS.

The following narrative is a short explanation of why the SEC will not protect retail investors, nor will the prosecute in any serious way Hedge funds engaging in naked shorting. For that matter they will not seriously penalize RH for any unethical business practices.

The SEC is generally speaking a corrupt arm of the government, filled with inept lawyers who don’t know jack shit about how finances work, and the ones that do are crooked.

Harry M. Markopolos is a certified Fraud Examiner and  forensic accountant. He was also left the army as a Major, former infantry officer, 17 years of service Active Duty, Guard and Reserve.

In 1999 while Markopolos was employed by Rampart, he was asked to replicated Bernie Madoff’s successfull portfolio. It took Markopolos less than a day to realize that Madoff was running a large Ponzi Scheme. When the ponzi scheme crashed and burned, it was the single largest theft in the history of the world $65 Billion Dollars.

Markopolos travelled all over the world collecting evidence and files more that 12 complaints with the SEC and FBI office over a period of 10 years. The government came him the middle finger.

He testified before congress—more than 6 hours of video can be seen on SPAN, he named names of the crooked officials and inept clowns in the SEC.

He has had his life threatened repeatedly, for his whistleblowing.  This is all searchable on the internet, Wikipedia, News articles: CNN, FOX… yada yada yada…

Harry claims that the SEC is so tanked up with for Security Investors or compromised individuals, and that there whole goal is to keep the Wall Street Fraudsters in business, and will only come down on them when their business gets to out of hand, and could compromise the machine…

Kind of how the Mafia wouldn’t approve of dealing heroin.

Another Canadian play. Another solid gold play. One to hold and enjoy the divvies but also feeling safe that you’re in at price levels that existed before we wasted our time in the Middle East.


 That play? Suncor. TSE: SU, NYSE: SU


You may be thinking, wow this is some slow ass dino-stock that I can’t meme on. However, fatty gains are pretty much guaranteed.


Why?


1.	Everyone (see: moron analysts) thinks that oil is dead. These fuckers sit around in their downtown condos, wearing Patagonia sweater vests and thinking that just because they don’t drive their compact german executive car as often to mom’s house, that no one is driving at all. Take a look at the suburbs you hedgie-tard, take a look at ASEAN, Asia, Africa etc. People are going to driving their cars (we’ve sold 60 mil+ a year for years, almost all of those are gasoline powered). No one in these meme times can afford a Tesla or a BYD shit box unless you made money on gamestop. Yea I made 100% flipping gamestop in a day, hold my bags. China lays 8000km of highway a year, you’re not going to power that kind of growth with a fucking battery pack Elon.


2.	The Russian vaccine cannot be underestimated. It’s 91% effective for normal cases and 100% effective against severe and moderate cases according to a study from the Lancet. Russia now has this vaccine produced in South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Pakistan etc. Only rich western countries can afford extended lockdowns, Russia has just liberated the developing worlds economies with a 10$ vaccine that can be stored in a fridge. For all intents and purposes, this pandemic is done. Russia has forced the hand of western supply chains if they want to make money. 


3.	Suncor has entered into agreements with Canadian government bodies to retrofit stations with EV charging ports. Suncor has >1800 stations in Canada. If they have to , they can easily pivot their stations into EV charging locations and with consumer presence of mind, everyone knows where their local petro Canada station is. Highly pivotable operations. Why would they let some eco-nerds start an EV charging chain on their soil? 


4.	There's nothing proprietary or mind blowing about EV charging companies, once the big boy gas companies step in, they're just going to install it in the stations that are already there.


5.	Good balance sheet, Warren buffet has been invested for a long time. But he bought the dip and recently sold his the shares he bought in 2020. He still has >13m shares, FMR bought about $500 million worth of Suncor in the last quarter. Strong free cash flow through gas stations (one place you can still go during the entire pandemic without masks, gloves or any requirements, been open for business this whole time).


6.	They can maintain dividends at WTI $35 according to their report, if WTI stays >55 this is a no brainer. Currently the market is pricing in about $55 wti so once the market prices in $60, on a DCF that makes the company worth $45.8B Canadian. 


7.	Geopolitics. Biden isn’t cancelling new drilling permits just because “DUDE SAVE THE PLANET MAN”. America not wasting its hydrocarbon stores is smart in case of a protracted conflict in the Pacific with China. Why ship oil in from the Saudis and Venezuela when you have a shit ton of shale safe in Texas. America is rich enough to have countries deplete their own reserves for America’s consumption and Canada is happy to help. The Keystone pipeline oil will just get shipped down on trains owned by Berkshire and Bill Gates (yea gates owns like 14% of CN rail and is the largest shareholder of that rail company, the more you know lol). The TMX pipeline is full steam ahead and will be completed by dec 2022. This completition will help shrink the gap between WCS and WTI and allow Canada to sell its oil all around the world. Suncor has committed to fill these pipes with its juice too.


8.	Our X-Factor. [This guy](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FF2LGW7EAU5O5FUGMDLZKTFU4E.jpg) did a giant tour around India and ASEAN promoting Canadian business. What is Canadian business? Mostly natural resources and finance lol. We’re going to sell our Oil Sands through the port of BC to developing Asian nations around the world and help them gain energy independence from China. Canada standing by ready to help keep the free-world, free. You think this guy went around the pacific just for fun? 


9.	The last quarter showed great cost management and shows that Suncor is looking after shareholder interests. Shareholder interest in this sector are no  longer about growing production capacity but about delivering value to shareholder through dividends and buybacks. Management has already started buying back shares and its just a matter of time before they reinstate the dividend to .42 cents a share….every quarter LOL


10.	Hedge against inflation. We’ve printed a shit ton of dollars and now people want to tell me that a barrel of oil (148L of oil, equal to 20-30 gallons of gasoline and 10-20 gallons of diesel) should only cost $60 usd? $60 usd? I shit on $60. $60 wont even get a Saudi prince the paint on his tomahawk missles. Fuck off with this fake scam money, commodities serve a specified purpose and their value is derived from that. 


11.	Marko Kolanovic, a quant at JPM who LITERALLY called the bottom of the corona market dump says were entering a new oil “supercycle”. If someone that smart and connect says it, then you don’t even need to listen to me anymore. Suncor was trading at 40$ cad before this pandemic came around, and it will again.


For all you cr*pto-morons, here: SU-coin is a limited quantity e-coin that returns you .21 to .42 cents  a quarter and each day grows its proportional share of Canada’s second largest oil producer through management buying coins and destroying them. Wow so cool.

2/18/21 07:57,"$PLUG Power is Extremely Oversold, Here’s Why $PLUG is current trading down ~25% from last months ATH of $75.49 to about $56 at the time of this writing, despite a strong forward outlook and many huge news releases/partnerships announced in the last couple of months. This is why I believe $PLUG has been consolidating and is currently massively undervalued.

**Purchase Orders & Partnerships with Walmart & Amazon**
$PLUG’s largest single customers are currently the retail & e-commerce behemoths, Walmart and Amazon. Both companies utilizing their hydrogen fuel cell packs and refueling stations to power light commercial vehicles in stores/distribution centers (think forklifts and the like for LTC vehicles). These are both huge name customers throwing their weight behind Plug Power with no indication of switching away from their products, but will continue to need more as they respectively, continue to grow.

These three major announcements push Plug’s offerings beyond U.S borders opening up revenue from hundreds of millions of potential consumers, both civilian and corporate customers. Clean Hydrogen as a major energy source in SK, hydrogen power LTCV and mass market consumer vehicles with Renault in EU, and reaching Spain’s goal of 100% clean energy in only 9 years by 2030 with Acciona S.A.

**Biden-Harris LOVE clean energy**

Its no secret the current administration is funneling a metric fuck load of money toward Green/Clean energy. Including [targeting low-cost hydrogen production within their newly launched Climate Innovation Working Group](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-Announces-Preeti-Pande-as-New-Chief-Marketing-Officer/default.aspx). This coupled with the [US Department of Energy’s $100 million in funding to further R&D clean energy initiatives via the Advanced Research Projects Agency- Energy’s (ARPA-E) OPEN 2021 program.](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-announces-100-million-transformative-clean-energy-solutions-supporting).

**Ok, so why did it crash this week?**

“Some fucking country in Europe took a shit [(Norway)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-u.s.-fuel-cell-stocks-are-crashing-2021-02-17), Let them do what they want to fucking do. Our market’s solid.”
Norway is opening some hydrogen facility to expand their energy dependent economy. All of their exports are oil, now they want to dip their toes in hydrogen. Norway is tiny, and really a non-issue imo. Their primary focus is still oil, natural gas, and fish lmao. Long term this could be good as the region becomes more accepting of hydrogen and Plug Power, as the current clear leader in the space, can wiggle in for a piece of the pie. $BE & $FCEL are also sliding down, though this appears to be slowing down, primed for a sharp reversal.

TL;DR: Hydrogen is a key part of the global transition to green/clean energy. Will it outshine EV/ICE cars? Fuck no, but it doesn’t need to make a metric fuck ton of money. $PLUG is the clear leader in the hydrogen space, and their lead will continue to grow.

Disclosure: This is not financial advice. This is my DD that I am choosing to share to simply spark a conversation and share my own personal thoughts for others to poke a hole in in case I overlook something. I am long $PLUG via 1k shares and given today’s market slide, should it continue, I’ll be converting some of my holdings to LEAPS dating Jan 2023.

**Who is RIDE**

Lordstown Motors Corp., an automotive company, develops, manufactures, and sells light duty electric trucks targeted for sale to fleet customers. It primarily develops Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. Lordstown Motors Corp. was founded in 2019 and is based in Lordstown, Ohio.

**What does all that mean?**

There is demand. There is cash with more cash coming from the government. There is celebrity investors pushing their products with skin in the game.

**Is this company real? Nikola did bad things.**

Nikola scared a lot of you from these SPACs claiming EV offerings. I don't know why anyone believed in them when they had nothing from near day 1.

But Lordstown is differnent. Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries. Lordstown is real.

**Something about crayons.**

I will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/17/2020) at $32.43 while RIDE is at $24.74. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.

**What makes them different**

Their biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).

**What does your crystal ball tell you?**

Absolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop. Too much money is in this and the company uses actual electric powered motors, and not the gravitation powered ones made famous by Nikola.

**Catalysts**

March will see [57 beta vehicles produced](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-start-building-beta-prototypes-of-endurance-pickup/). These will be used for crash tests and such, but more importantly, be sent to initial fleet customers for feedback.

April - ??? The Department of Energy will decide on the loan. I[t helps when you have a huge cheerleader in office (Tim Ryan).](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/lordstown-motors-is-riding-on-hopes-with-biden-and-ryan/ar-BB1dmEBd)

Some time this year we'll see the EV RV and Van designs/concepts.

September The beginning of live production.

**Price targets**

Using GM forward P/E and 4% margins on revenue, this stock will range between $33 and $198. The $198 assumes full capacity of 600,000 vehicles sold. $33 assumes the 100,000 vehicles sold yearly. I'm comfortable with $115 - $125.

2/22/21 05:01,"WHERE ART THOU ROMEO??? Positions: 1.7k shares with $15.7 average. Additionally currently holding 15C March calls anticipating a breakout.

TLDR: If you're going to make a speculative bet on commercial EVs, you're best off betting on the company positioning themselves to benefit from them all. Recent catalysts and price action prime RMO for a breakout.

Ticker: RMO = Romeo Power

What is Romeo Power?

Romeo Power produces clean energy products for commercial EVs. Their 113k squarefoot facility in CA primarily manufactures high-density battery packs for Class 8 trucks and buses, but the real value of RMO is speculative in nature based on their ambitions to expand to other vehicle Classes and be a leader in the entire commercial EV market.

RMO currently has $544M in contracted revenue (Lion Electric, BorgWarner, Workhorse, Oshkosh, Nikola, BMW, etc). More interestingly, they state they currently have up to $2.2B (pending contracted revenue) under advanced negotiation.

They emphasize the significance of the world's largest companies such as UPS, USPS, Amazon, Walmart, etc committing to EV fleets, as well as the significance of OEMs all developing EV programs. It's worth reminding that the Biden administration has yet to flesh out the logistics of transitioning to EV by 2035. As a California-based clean tech company (and Black owned) Romeo is poised to get favorable government assistance.

With $2.2B under advanced negotiation the possibilities are exciting to say the least since these negotiations are currently undisclosed. Expect RMO stock to be buoyed by more and more announcements of partnerships and contracts.

With the services RMO offers it's only a matter of time before they announce a contract with a recognizable company that will cause a breakout in the share price.

Why will there be a breakout soon?

RMO has been bleeding heavily after rallying to ATH of nearly $40/share after the SPAC announcement. It's been heavily shorted and bled even more after Morgan Stanley announced a $12 PT based on them not currently having profitability. This PT is such a misunderstanding of what makes RMO a desirable purchase. With $2.2B under negotiation and $544M secured I'm comfortable overlooking near term financials, and I believe other's are too, especially in today's market. RMO has pulled back to $15/share, a 100%+ discount from recent highs.

On Friday (2/19) Romeo Power announced a business deal with Ecellix to develop next-gen EV battery technology by combining RMO's battery packs with Ecellix's high energy density silicon (rather than graphite) based batteries, reducing the weight of Class 8 trucks 25% and allowing for a range of 600 miles. In commercial trucking, range is everything. This is a massive improvement in Lithium Ion battery tech. Despite this amazing news, RMO only gained 4% and ended the week in the red.

RMO had a strong close on Friday AH and reclaimed $15. I think $14-15 is the bottom for RMO. There's too much money under negotiation and too bright of a future for RMO. I believe RMO will reclaim $20 this week and retest $30-40 in the next couple months if any major announcement drops.",34528,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.719407678,True

2/25/21 05:43,"Osk making big moves! Stole this post from another subreddit. This is u/ puts_on_you post. Not my dd. 

Oshkosh wins USPS contract, Microvast will be supplying their EV for next 10 years+

So 100% of the USPS contract was awarded to $OSK as a 10 year binding contract to make up to 165,000 vans. The USPS is initially investing $482 so Oshkosh can ""finalize the production design of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) — a purpose-built, right-hand-drive vehicle for mail and package delivery"" (1) They can already produce the ICE vehicles, so this investment is to enable them to produce EV in house

Oshkosh invested $25M in Microvast (THCB) and announced a joint development agreement with Microvast. A JDA is pretty much we will work on a project together. This is the project (the USPS vehicle). I believe that once Oshkosh has the means to produce EVs, that is what they will provide. This is where the industry and society is going, eventually... 

According to Postmaster General Louis Dejoy, their 10 year plan (which mostly has to do with Oshkosh and Microvast making those platypus looking vans) will strengthen them as an entity, he had this to say today (3)

 ""The key commitments of this plan will include:

1. A commitment to six- and seven-day a week delivery service to every address in the nation, not just because it is the law—but because it is a key ingredient to our future success.
2. A commitment to stabilizing and strengthening our workforce—especially for our associates who are not yet in a career position.  We want every postal employee to have the tools, training, and supportive environment necessary to enjoy a long-term career with us. 
3. A commitment to investing in our network infrastructure, including vehicles, technology, and package sortation equipment.  We demonstrated this commitment with our  award yesterday, and look forward to working with Congress to determine if our electric vehicle goals can be accelerated.""

These are three huge statements that I believe are achievable. Part of this plan is replacing their entire fleet, which has been around for 25-32 years. They want to increase their ability to reach rural homes (where ICE vehicles may be more viable), and ""invest in network infranstructure... our electric vehicle goals can be accelerated"". 

This is playing out exactly as I've predicted over the last couple months. I was pleasantly surprised to learn about Oshkosh when the DA was announced. Now we are here, it's huge. If you hold this for multiple years, this could be a 5-10 bagger, and I'm all in! Disclosure and disclaimer: i have 6500 warrants and 1000 shares and 50 shares of $OSK and I got 0 $WKHS XD

I am not telling you to buy this stock - I used to have some. Sold it all and then invested in this gamestopthingy. That said, this is on the topic of shorting wars.

I got this in an email.

I found the concept interesting - another shorting battle. It is interesting to see companies fight back, but to also announce that they are doing so.

**SolarWindow Responds to Short-And-Distort Campaign: “We Will Not be Bullied. We Will Protect Our Stockholders.”**  
New York, New York; Seoul, South Korea - February 24, 2021 – SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: WNDW), today issued a stern warning to financial predators orchestrating a “short-and-distort” campaign, utilizing innuendos, false conclusions, and mischaracterizations designed to discredit the Company in order to manipulate the share price downwards and profit at the expense of SolarWindow stockholders.

We will protect our stockholders, and will not be bullied from our mission to create and commercialize transparent electricity-generating glass and plastics for commercial building windows, greenhouses, automotive applications, and more,” stated Mr. Jay S. Bhogal, President and CEO of SolarWindow.

“Nearly every major scientific or technology breakthrough is first ridiculed by those ignorant of its potential, then subverted by those threatened by its disruptive implications, and finally revealed as self-evident. Our innovative technology is no different.”

The Company’s coatings and technologies can be applied to generate electricity on building windows and facades, balcony railings, curtain walls, skylights, and shading systems, as well as automotive, truck, marine and aircraft applications, and consumer products and military uses.

SolarWindow technologies, coatings, and applications processes are the subject of numerous patent awards with nearly 120 patent claims protected in the United States, Europe, China, and elsewhere. More than 200 additional patent claims are in-process in countries around the world.

In recent weeks, the SolarWindow Innovation Group has outpaced its development milestones and continues to deliver on its mandate to boost power output, cut costs, and optimize SolarWindow products for mass manufacturing using roll-to-roll production.

Among other breakthroughs, engineers and scientists in the SolarWindow Innovation Group recently reported an impressive 500% increase in testing speed, 12-fold increase in testing capacity and output, and 20-times reduction in material costs for rapid lab-scale prototyping of SolarWindow electricity-generating glass and plastics.

It is common for predatory short-sellers to ignore such tangible progress, and instead disparage the good reputation of companies by spreading rumors suggesting impropriety with business affiliates, partners and collaborators, thereby profiting at the expense of Company stockholders and other stakeholders.

SolarWindow is committed to shielding its stockholders from financial and reputational harm by predatory short-and-distort campaigns, and further protect its management, financing activities, commercial partnerships, and business development efforts currently underway.

All SolarWindow stakeholders, whether they be holders of our common stock, our suppliers or potential customers and collaborative partners, are advised to review information publicly available in the Company’s filings, press releases and published on its website.",35109,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.987874687,True

But what seems to be happening the leaders in the technology are not going to be supported with govt contracts. Instead the old economy companies are being given an on ramp to new technology using govt funds.

This was to be expected as the old economy companies have unions and Biden is a big Union guy.

2/23/21 14:03,"$OSK (Oshkosh) to Infinity and Beyond (Part 2) 🚀🚀🚀 This is Oshkosh the Manufacturing Conglomerate, not Oshkosh B'gosh. I have also put TLDR's in the beginning because I know you are all lazy cunts.

TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 2): Oshkosh’s current operative sectors are currently printing cash for the business. It has a strong debt to asset ratio with a TTM Free cashflow of 328M. This gives them a lot of room for R&D in the commercial electric vehicle space without diluting shares or taking on massive debt. In other words, they have fuck you money to go against competitors looking to get into the commercial EV space. A large portion of their current revenue comes from municipalities and government entities, so they have mastered the art of lobbing and government contracts \***USPS\***)

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

Oshkosh’s Rocket Ship will take us beyond the Universe.

In my last post **(**[**Part 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixp0/osk_oshkosh_to_infinity_and_beyond_part_1/)**)**, I discussed the management of the business, and why they have the track record to continually grow the company. It was fairly short as the numbers essentially spoke for themselves. This post will be focused on the business of Oshkosh in terms of its products and financial strength.

To reiterate, Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate in the sectors of access equipment, defense, fire & emergency, and commercial. The 2021 Q1 revenue for each sector is 563.7M, 550.3M, 273.9M, and 195.7M respectively. I have attached a [diagram](https://imgur.com/a/iajdpei) to show the breakdown of the sectors. As shown on the diagram, the largest money makers for Oshkosh are Access equipment and Defense, comprising 35.6% and 34.7% of the revenue respectively. Fire & emergency consists of 17.3%, and the commercial sector consists of 12.4%. (Look at the diagram, it’s easier to comprehend)

The business diversification shows that Oshkosh has a healthy revenue across different sectors, meaning that it does not have all its eggs in one basket. This was evident with Covid hitting. Although the revenue of Oshkosh was affected negatively, it was balanced out in different sectors. For example, the 2021 Q1 revenue for the Access equipment sector decreased by 21.5% and the Commercial sector fell by 12.7% compared to 2020. However, the total change in revenue only decreased by approximately 7% because the Defense and Fire & Emergency business grew. This shows that there is a small downside risk to Oshkosh. The source is taken from Q1 [presentations ](https://s24.q4cdn.com/975203404/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-2021-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf)from Oshkosh. Q4 2020 numbers will show a bigger dip in revenue, but you get the point. The business isn’t reliant on one type of business, and the management team was able to adapt quickly and bounce back.

(TDLR Paragraph: Certain manufacturing sectors were affected by Covid, but Oshkosh was able to withstand the hit due to different businesses. This means that it is hard to wipe this business out.)

(Skip this if you don’t care about each business sector.)

Oshkosh’s Access Equipment business is under JLG and a variety of brands, and it essential manufactures different types of lifts for the construction market. What is exciting about this business is that they have an all-electric scissor lift that was recently just released. This shows that Oshkosh is innovating, and looking to transition from offering only diesel products to electric products. Moreover, it shows that they are capable of it.

The Defense sector brings in a lot of money for Oshkosh, and it does not seem to be slowing down. They received an order for $911 million in 2021 Q1 alone. Moreover, they have a large backlog that will continue to pump cash into the business. There were arguments from my last post that Oshkosh has trouble fulfilling some orders. This was due to staffing challenges related to Covid. However, according to them, they were able to ramp up production successfully even with the setbacks. If they weren’t doing a decent job fulfilling orders, they would not get large orders like this.

(**Read: Oshkosh is constantly getting orders for the military sector. The military sector is related to government bids and contracts. This shows that Oshkosh has the experience and capability to win contracts with the government. Lobbying plays a big part, and this shows they are dammed good at it.\* USPS contract\***)

Oshkosh’s Fire & Emergency essentially creates fire trucks for municipalities. They achieved new record orders in FY2020. Additionally, they just released a new vehicle. They claim that backlog remains near-record level, meaning that they have a bunch of demand for the product that needs to be filled. Usually, that means it is a great business with a great product. Again, winning over government contracts is apart of their business model. This is their bread and butter. If there is any doubt that they can even get a piece of the USPS contract, this should crush that.

The Commercial sector consists of a bunch of different brands under Oshkosh. The commercial sector for Oshkosh has taken a hit due to Covid. However, they still have a backlog of $361 million. They offer a lot of great products that are required by commercial businesses and government entities.

Now that we are done going through each business that Oshkosh is in, we are going to dive into some financials, and they look good. I retrieved these numbers on yahoo finance. Look them up if you don’t believe it. (Disclaimer: these are approximate %). The Debt to Asset ratio for Oshkosh is **14%**. For people who are retarded and autistic, like me, and don’t know if that’s good, Workhorse has a debt to asset ratio of **102%**. No, larger percentages don’t mean it is better. Workhorse is leveraged up the ass, and if they don’t bring in some revenue, they are fucked so hard it is not even going to be funny. Their high leverage gives them little room for error. They aren't able to make many mistakes without sinking the ship. Compared to Workhorse, Oshkosh’s low debt to asset ratio allows them to invest in current business growth, new business ventures, and new products (eg. EV) without the fear of sinking the ship. They have already been doing this by investing in Microvast (🐝 🐝 🐝 ) and setting up a joint venture. I will get more into this in the next part.

**(For the people who are going to say debt is going to R&D and growth, fuck you. Workhorse’s revenue is for 2020 is $570 thousand. My wife’s allowance from her boyfriend is more than that.)** Workhorse’s cost of revenue is $5,845,000 while Oshkosh’s is $6,031,600,000. Based on just this number, it doesn’t look too bad, but it is horrendous. Basically, Workhorse is investing $15 to bring $1 in revenue (that is a -93.3% ROI). Oshkosh’s revenue is $7,268,300,000, and that gives us an ROI of 20%. This is purely revenue returns of course.

With the current business sectors' support, Oshkosh has a TTM Free Cashflow of $328M. This gives them room to either pay down their debts, which isn’t high. More importantly, this gives them room to grow into the EV space where they can continue to create products for their Commercial and Municipal customers. They can create the products, infrastructure, and sales teams without worrying about running out of cash. Just for a comparison, Workhorse has a TTM Free Cashflow of -$38.977M.

Oshkosh is a very old business that has great products with great numbers. One of the downsides that I can think of for this business is that they somehow lose all their current business. This is very unlikely because they were able to maintain strong numbers even with Covid. This was due to the management and the employees being able to adapt quickly during hard times, which is the reason **(**[**Part 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixp0/osk_oshkosh_to_infinity_and_beyond_part_1/)**)** was only about management competence. They are constantly releasing new products that are in high demand with large backorders.

I know what you’re thinking. Having great historical numbers isn’t going to guarantee growth in the future. It’s about innovation and the new type of business. However, the company is thinking about the future, and that is why they are looking to use their excess cash to develop commercial products in the EV space. What makes this an exciting play is the company is great at procuring government contracts. This is an art form that they have an advantage over new players in the EV space. You cannot disregard the importance of Lobby in winning contracts like the USPS. I will talk more about why Oshkosh is primed for growth based on the EV hype that other companies are receiving in Part 3

The main goal of Part 2 of this DD is to illustrate why the downside for this company is extremely low compared to a play like Workhorse. Workhorse will essentially need to dilute its shares for more cash, which decreases the value of the shares you bought. The reason is that it can’t leverage any more debt because it already has more debt than assets.

(Stay Tuned for Part 3. These take a fucking long time.)

2/27/21 08:41,"$CDXC: Short Squeeze / COVID Study / No Shares to Borrow / Little Known Company Hey WSB,

Been following this board a long time.  Thanks for the tendies.  Here's one to add to your radar.  Chromadex is a nutraceutical company specializing in NAD metabolism.  Before you degenerates get too defensive, it is ""science""... So here's the deal.  

&#x200B;

They have been studying their proprietary product, Nicotinamide Riboside for years and have 58 clinical trials we know of going at the moment. This product is available now on Amazon and direct from them. This is world altering research in the science of NAD metabolism.  Recently two big papers came out - one for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and COVID recovery.  Both have no treatment available or publicly known.  There are approximately 25% of the world population suffering from NAFLD and there is no treatment.  Big market.

Regardless, this stock has been undervalued for some time.  Breaking even on profit this year, owning several important patents for NRH (additional molecule, 100x more powerful and kills cancer cells in vitro), partnering with Nestle Health Sciences to create their Celltrient product targeting geezers, partnering with NIH, partnering with Watsons Hong Kong and getting sizable investments.  Historically this has been an institution stock.  NAD metabolism is the cellular mitochondrial repair and energy metabolism and has major implications for diseases, especially cancer and COVID but also dementia, DC (premature aging), and potentially anti-aging benefits.

So on Wednesday they dropped the paper and no one knows what it means because people can't read.  Thursday the stock ripped 100% and now sits below a 1b valuation.

Here's the juicy part. Today, almost 40m shares were shorted because people DON'T KNOW what this stock is and how big the market is. Remember when everyone was trying to explain to other retards what Palantir does? Same thing, in bio technology and science.   Because it was ""little known"" they rushed to short the pop and it worked, fell 25% today.  Shorted into oblivion.  Normal short interest is 2m shares and bears are cocky. 

&#x200B;

Also keep in mind that the bears don't know why it went up and assume it's just the COVID study.  The Fatty Liver study is much much bigger.  If 10% of the population of the US with Fatty Liver took this supplement, it would equate to a 500+ share price.  Not a joke.

This is a 10b company easy, once they gain the necessary market share.  More info on Seeking Alpha.

&#x200B;

TLDR

This company sells an amazing product that resolves unresolvable (until now) disorders based on cellular metabolism and people aren't smart enough to read papers to know what it does so when it popped shorts piled on and they're overextended with only 9k shares to borrow so on Monday it might moon to a reasonable value (25 million potential customers, easily x $35/month = a lot of bread) 
Position 70k long shares + 190 March 21 calls

2/26/21 07:43,"Energy Squeeze Play - Oil Price Crash Anniversary Real DD from JP Morgan Quant on Oil / Energy Equities  

""According to JPMorgan quant *Kolanovic*, the biggest short squeeze yet is set to begin next month as systematic funds, momentum chasers, trend followers and the CTA community in general cover their legacy shorts in the energy sector and go long. CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive. However, this is in the context of a huge systematic net short overhang in the energy sector. In other words, energy - in all forms be it oil or energy stocks - remains the most hated sector across all investors. 

The catalyst that forces the squeeze is the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the Covid crisis, at which point various vol metrics followed by vol-control funds will reset and they will have no choice but to go long. That - *and this is the punchline of Kolanovic's thesis*  \-  will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which is also a gentle hint from the JPM quant to all the redditors out there: if you want to spark a truly historic short squeeze, one which forces systematic shorts to not only cover but to go long, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks. 

Kolanovic was kind enough to even give you the timing: you have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor **""will need to rebalance in March by closing \~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding \~2% to energy longs, for a \~22% net buying in Energy.""**

What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Well, the Croatian quant calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about \~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, **""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn.""** It could be far, far more. As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. And, remarkably, **the most recent number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average**.

 We then said that since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance. It now appears that said frontrunning of the CTA squeeze officially kicked off yesterday because according to Goldman prime on Monday, Feb 22, on the same day the bank saw the largest net selling in US Macro Products since Jan 27, the biggest increase in ETF shorts since November (offset however by aggressive buying in single names), **it also observed the official start of sector rotation into energy stocks, as ""energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years"" a +5.8 sigma move.**

*Here are the market details from Goldman's Prime Service for Feb 22:*

**The GS Prime book saw the largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-1.5 SDs vs. the average daily net flow of the past year), driven by short sales outpacing long buys 5 to 1.**

 **US equities – Largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-2.0 SDs) driven by short sales in Macro Products**

* **Macro Products** (Index and ETF combined) saw the largest net selling since Jan 27th.  Macro Products have been net sold in 9 of the past 10 trading days.
* **ETF shorts increased +4.3%** – the largest 1-day increase since November – driven by Large Cap, Technology, and Corporate Bond ETFs. ETF shorts have increased +9% week/week (+25% YTD) and now make up 21.4% of the non-Index US short book, the highest level on our record going back to 2012.
* **Single Names were modestly net bought overall** (+0.2 SDs) – Sector flows were split driven by net buying in Energy (long buys > short covers), Real Estate (short covers > long sales), Comm Svcs (long buys > short sales), and Health Care (long buys > short sales) vs. net selling in Info Tech (short sales > long buys), Materials (long sales), Financials (short sales > long sales), and Consumer Disc (long sales > short covers).

**Energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years (+5.8 SDs), w**hile Info Tech was the most net sold sector, the $ net selling was relatively modest (-1.0 SDs) driven by short sales.

* **FAAMG (GSTMTMEG) – Collectively the TMT Mega Caps were modestly net bought yesterday,** driven by risk-off flows with short covers outpacing long sales 1.4 to 1. The group had been net sold for four straight days (8 of the past 10) coming into yesterday – aggregate long/short ratio (MV) of the group had declined -33% MTD to 14.6, which is in the 23rd percentile vs. the past year.

2/27/21 01:02,"OSK vs WKHS (Let's Talk About the Madness) This is a discussion for the people who were following the USPS contract drama. Everything that I am posting here is partial speculation. I am more than happy for you to shit on my post or downvote me to oblivion. I would just like to kindly ask you to post your positions.

**(Full Disclosure: I still have 4/16 115 Calls)**

I have put TLDR's in the beginning and after each key paragraph because I know you are all lazy cunts.

**(TLDR: WKHS was on the brink of going BK, so there was massive manipulation in the market to make sure the suits would lose less money. OSK was thrown as bait, causing its price increase from the USPS contract to fall straight back down. The reason is that OSK is a sustainable company with great financials and can withstand it.)**

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself. This is also based on my theories and speculation.

As some of you may know, OSK (Oshkosh) was awarded the USPS contract for the new fleet of vehicles. It was a contract for $480M to finalize production for next-generation Vehicles. The total contract can be worth up to $6B to supply 50,000 to 165,000 over 10 years. Once the news broke out, OSK went from ≈$103 to ≈$118 high. This is about a 14.5% increase in the company’s value, which is ≈ 1B in market cap value. With OSK’s TTM revenue of 7.2B, it gave them a multiple of revenue of ≈1.12x. The TTM EBITDA $668M, which calculates ≈ 11.9 times multiple. These multiples do not account for the projected revenue and EBITDA with the new USPS contract. The industry average on EBITDA multiples is around 13.8 times for manufacturing companies. The average multiple for auto & trucking is 45.73 times, according to [NYU Stearns](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/vebitda.html). Without the projections of  EBITDA gains from the USPS contract, it is already significantly undervalued based on (Enterprise Value/ EBITDA).

**(TLDR: Even if OSK was at the all-time high of $118 per share, it was still undervalued by approximately 32 times, using TTM numbers (****No projections and based on USPS gains****). This is based on the auto and trucking industry standards for public companies. In other words, it didn’t matter if OSK got the USPS contract or not. It was still way undervalued.)**

I am screaming at the top of my lungs that OSK is undervalued, so you are probably wondering why OSK fell like a ton of bricks back to $104 when the News about **One House Democrat** cried foul play on the USPS deal. 

**Whatever I am going to say now is partially theory pulled based on available information online. I would love for anyone to call me out if I may be wrong but post your positions also.**

This is where Workhorse plays a significant role in the movement of OSK stock. As some of you might have noticed, WKHS’s value dropped by nearly 50% after it was announced that OSK was awarded the contract rather than WKHS. Some may agree and some might disagree, but WKHS was banking on the contract to essentially survive. In other words, it was a Hail Mary that would have saved them from all their struggles. I will not go into enterprise value and EBITDA ratios with WKHS or any of that because they only have a TTM revenue of ≈500K. You read right 500k, not 500M. It would just be a waste of my time.

This is really scary because WKHS has a lot of debt on its books. As of 9/30/2020, WKHS had a net debt of $123.228M. Additionally,[ WKHS raised an additional 200M](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-gets-200-million-to-advance-electric-van-production). This adds up to around 323M in debt, assuming they did not pay any off from 9/30. There was no way for WKHS to service that debt without bringing in new revenue. If they cannot service the debt based on historical numbers, how are they going to service the new debt? The Creditors approved debt as they were betting on WKHS getting the USPS contract. WKHS either had some excellent investment bankers, or the underwriters need to be fired because this was pure speculation, which is a big bet for debt financing. When the news came out two days ago that OSK was awarded the contract, WKHS went tits up. Even though the terms on the loans did not require WKHS to repay Debt until 2024, creditors felt the pressure as WKHS lost the contract. Additionally, the company’s value decreased by half, leading to any debt convertible to stocks being less valuable. If creditors do not feel that a company is capable of servicing a debt, they can recall the loan anytime (Correct me if I am wrong). This probably was going to happen. They were flirting with [insolvency](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workhorse-share-collapse-raises-pressure-131704051.html), and all their investors would have lost their investment. The largest investor before all this drama was not ARK. It was your big institutions and mutual funds ([ie. Blackrock Inc., Vanguard Group, Inc. (The), and Seaport Global Asset Management, LLC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WKHS/holders?p=WKHS)), and they would have lost a lot of money.

**(TLDR Paragraph: WKHS was close to being insolvent if creditors decided to pull the plug. They had all the reason to with WKHS losing the race for the USPS contract.)**

**(Disclaimer: this is Speculation and Theories)**

What does this have to do with OSK going down? They both have the same largest institutional investors backing the stock ([Blackrock and Vanguard](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/holders?p=OSK)). Within a day after the news, Blackrock would have lost ≈$185M in value and Vanguard would have lost ≈$137M, assuming they did not sell any shares after 12/31/2020. They both would have made only ≈70M from the OSK stock price jump. This leaves them with the choice of the small gain from OSK or large losses from WKHS. If these institutions let WKHS sink, they would have lost all their investment, which was approximately an additional $150M for Blackrock and $100M for Vanguard. These are just calculations for 2 of the institutional investors. Institutions would have to bear a larger cost letting WKHS go BK without some gains rather than allowing OSK to jump up from the news. The Creditors also would have lost a lot of money if this were to happen as there will be unserviced debt and a loss in value in the convertible stocks. Even if OSK went down, the suits would not have lost much money because OSK can sustain itself without the USPS contract. With OSK’s management, OSK has grown year over year. This is not just enterprise value. They increased revenue and EBIT every year before the Covid since the CEO has been in place.

**(TLDR Paragraph: Big money and Creditors would have lost big by letting WKHS go BK. It is okay for OSK to fall in the short term because it is undervalued, and they proved they could grow year over year.)**

This is where a lot of manipulation might be happening behind the scenes. There was a bunch of shorting and options activity during this time. This was probably institutional investors hedging their bets to make up for losses. For example, ARK bought multiple dips on WKHS as the stock plummeted from the news. They nearly doubled their position. By the timing of god himself, news came out merely hours claiming House Dem will push back hard on USPS decision to choose OSK. This is, apparently, one House Democrat crying foul play, not the whole house, where the title tries to mislead you into thinking. Since OSK was linked to the USPS contract, it fell with regards to the news. In my opinion, way too much as I believe it is extremely undervalued. There might also be additional selling to exacerbate the WKHS dump. As I finish writing this, WKHS was a clear Buy then Sell scheme with news that was over-exaggerated and probably paid for to minimize huge losses that would have come with WKHS insolvency. The people who would bear the pain are people who believed that WKHS is a good company. I have seen people comparing WKHS to Nikola, stating how it was undervalued compared to each other. What they don’t understand is that they were comparing garbage to garbage. With this belief that Wood can do no wrong, a bunch of people jumped over the cliff.

(TLDR Paragraph: OSK had to take the fall for WKHS while the markets were manipulated to prop up WKHS, so the suits would not have to take as big of a loss. The pain will be transferred to the retail investors as a sea of retailer investors followed Cathie Wood into buying the dip.)

2/26/21 22:22,"DD on $TELL - Do you live in Texas right now? You'll need this  

I AM NOT A FINNANCIAL ADVISOR. NO SOLICITATION IS BEING MADE. 

**What's a TELL (Tellurian)?**

 Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial phase will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing.""

**But why tho?**

Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time. 

TELL main business is Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). While not considered ""clean"" energy, it has commonly been considered the cleaner of the ""bad guy"" energies. This was pushed by the Obama admin as a cleaner alternative to coal. But even if we (USA) decide to shift to 100% ""clean"" energy, there will still be demand for other energy sources until we get there (at least 10 years of solid demand).

**What about pipelines?**

The advantage of LNG over regular Natural Gas is that it can fit into tiny containers and DOES NOT need to travel through a pipeline for TELL to deliver it. It can go on trucks/boats/etc. The customers who buy LNG from TELL will be able to decide to keep in LNG form to transport OR they can turn it back into gas and transport through a pipeline. win-win.

**Advantage over competitors?**

Biden wants to appeal to voters and will try to keep energy clean-ish. One way is to not allow land to be leased for natural gas or oil. That is GOOD for TELL, because they own the land on their (wait for it...) new Driftwood Project facility on LAND THEY OWN, NOT LEASE. They are not only increasing supply, but no new competitors would be able to come in unless they already own the land.

**Price Targets?**

$1.50 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued between $400-$500 million / 329M shares = $1.50

1/21/2021 - Wolfe Research - PT $5.00

1/29/2021 - Double Moving Average Crossover (21-week 50-week) - Bullish

At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.

2021 - February = $4-$6 (1B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - March/April = $8-$12 - Deals announced gap up (3B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - May/June or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)

2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.

Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

**This is mostly sentiment, what about the fundamentals?**

Fuck You. Every big money is putting their money int his basket. I'm sure the numbers are there if you look. I'm not going to. The market cares about sentiment and subjective investing right now. Also, look at the fucking chart. This thing going moon. All I know is I put money in the box and more money come out of box. Repeat.

**What else?**

The CEO wears a track suit in his investor updates. Just watch them.

TLDR; Tracksuit wearing CEO has permits to build facility to increase supply to meet increased demand for Liquified Natural Gas (doesn't need pipelines) on our transition to true clean energy. Government regulations expected to eliminate any new competition. Not even close to pre-covid price. If you like money, buy this.

""The Company is not currently in the production stage and generally utilizes suppliers for outside development and engineering support.""

SOURCE: see 10K page 78 here: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128921000006/nkla-20201231.htm#i58a5fa00c30341b39fdb3dd97678d6e1_624

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/nikola-corporation-nkla-q4-2020-earnings-call-tran/

In fact, 10k states it clearly:

""We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of our trucks, which is not expected to begin at least until 2022 for our BEV truck and the second half of 2023 for our FCEV truck, and may occur later. Even if we are able to successfully develop and sell or lease our trucks, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful""

And here:

""We expect to derive revenue from our BEV trucks in late 2021 and FCEV trucks in the second half 2023. Prior to commercialization, we must complete modification or construction of required manufacturing facilities, purchase and integrate related equipment and software, and achieve several research and development milestones. As a result, we will require substantial additional capital to develop our products and services and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from product sales and hydrogen FCEV leases, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of existing cash on hand, public offerings, private placements, debt financings, collaborations, and licensing arrangements.""

And here:

“We expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be significantly high in future periods as we:

•design, develop and manufacture our trucks;

•construct and equip our manufacturing plant to produce our trucks in Arizona;

•modify and equip the Iveco manufacturing plant in Germany to produce our trucks in Europe;

•build up inventories of parts and components for our trucks;

manufacture an available inventory of our trucks;

•develop and deploy our hydrogen fueling stations;

•expand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities;

•increase our sales and marketing activities and develop our distribution infrastructure; and

•increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.

Because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenue with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significant. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenue, which would further increase our losses.""

Then there's is the pesky issue of multiple lawsuits and investigations hanging over Nikola:

“On September 10, 2020, Hindenburg Research LLC reported on certain aspects of the Company’s business and operations. The Company and its board of directors retained Kirkland & Ellis LLP to conduct an internal review in connection with the Hindenburg article (the “Internal Review”), and Kirkland & Ellis promptly contacted the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to make it aware of the commencement of the Internal Review. The Company subsequently learned that the staff of the Division of Enforcement had previously opened an investigation. On September 14, 2020, the Company and five of its officers and employees, including Mark Russell, our Chief Executive Officer, received subpoenas from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement as a part of a fact-finding inquiry related to aspects of the Company’s business as well as certain matters described in the Hindenburg article. The Staff of the Division of Enforcement issued additional subpoenas to another three of the Company’s officers and employees, including Kim Brady, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, on September 21, 2020 and to the Company’s current and former directors on September 30, 2020.

The Company and Mr. Milton also received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (the “SDNY”) on September 19, 2020.
(...)
The Company also received a grand jury subpoena from the N.Y. County District Attorney’s Office on September 21, 2020. On October 16, 2020, the N.Y. County District Attorney’s Office agreed to defer its investigation; it has not withdrawn its subpoena issued to the Company, but has informed the Company that no further productions to it are necessary at this time.
(...)
The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations, nor can it predict whether any other governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations. The outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include a wide variety of outcomes, including the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former employees, officers and/or directors, the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and/or sanctions, modifications to business practices and compliance programs and/or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions. 
(...)
Further, to the extent that these investigations and any resulting third-party claims yield adverse results over time, such results could jeopardize the Company's operations and exhaust its cash reserves, and could cause stockholders to lose their entire investment.

Shareholder Securities Litigation

Beginning on September 15, 2020, six putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and, in one case, violations of the Unfair Competition Law under California law (the “Shareholder Securities Litigation”). The complaints generally allege that the Company and certain of its officers and directors made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Company's business plan and prospects.
(...) 
Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount in damages, attorneys’ fees, and other relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.

Derivative Litigation

Beginning on September 23, 2020, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Byun v. Milton, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-01277-UNA; Salguocar v. Girsky et. al., Case No. 1:20-cv-01404-UNA), purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company's current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and gross mismanagement. The Byun action also brings claims for unjust enrichment and abuse of control, while the Salguocar action brings a claim for waste of corporate assets.
(...)
On December 18, 2020, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Huhn v. Milton et al., Case No. 2:20-cv-02437-DWL, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company’s current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, unjust enrichment, and against defendant Jeff Ubben, a member of the Company’s board of directors, insider selling and misappropriation of information.
(...)
The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and fees associated with bringing the actions, and reform of the Company's corporate governance, risk management and operating practices. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the foregoing complaints. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.""

The problem with all these investigations and lawsuits is that Nikola Motor has admitted that they have merit:

“The Hindenburg article alleged that Mr. Milton or the Company made a number of statements, which it asserted were inaccurate, including but not limited to the following:

1.in July 2016, the Company stated that it owned rights to natural gas wells, and in August 2016 that the wells were used as a backup to solar hydrogen production;

2.in August 2016, Milton and the Company stated that the Company had engineered a zero emissions truck;

3.in December 2016, Milton stated that the Nikola One was a fully functioning vehicle;

4.that an October 2017 video released by the Company gave the impression the Nikola One was driven;

5.in April 2019, Milton stated that solar panels on the roof of the Company’s headquarters produce approximately 18 megawatts of energy per day;

6.in December 2019 and July 2020, Milton stated that the Company “can produce” over 1,000 kg of hydrogen at the Company’s demo stations and that the Company was “down below” $3/kg at that time;

7.in July 2020, Milton stated that “all major components are done in house”; he made similar statements in June 2020;

8.in July 2020, Milton stated that the inverter software was the most advanced in the world and that other OEMs had asked to use it; and

9.in July 2020, Milton stated that five trucks were “coming off the assembly line” in Ulm, Germany.

The statements listed above were inaccurate in whole or in part, when made.""

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow LM to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays, a 24/7 tech hotline and Good Sam’s Roadside Assistance Program, Lordstown Motors customers are expected to enjoy one of the most comprehensive EV support systems ever designed.

This partnership might not seem like a big deal on the surface, but it’s basically giving LM an instant country-wide presence for its customers at a tiny fraction of the cost that it would take to build their own service centers. This is HUGE.

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles have been officially announced: an [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and an [electric RV](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34980821/lordstown-camping-world-electric-rv/) in partnership with Camping World.

**Areas for concern:**

This is pretty obvious. Some folks are skeptical because Lordstown Motors is a “start-up” and will have to compete against larger companies. Analyst price targets range from as low as $18 to as high as $50.

But speaking of being skeptical, [I thought THIS TWEET from the Camping World CEO yesterday](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1365670229024645121?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) was interesting. He seems to be VERY confident in [what LM is doing](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

**My position:**

950 shares. The CEO Steve Burns is a very intelligent man, and I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute. Most people don’t know that 17 years ago, [he developed the technology patents that were eventually used for Apple’s Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

**Final comment:**

I made this post to increase awareness for a company that I think is flying under the radar to most investors. There is also a really high short interest right now as the whole EV market has sold off. I think all of the shorts are about to get squeezed.

It was disclosed at that time that in terms of equity structure, Ant Group contributed 4 billion yuan to 50% of the shares, Nanshang Bank accounted for 15.01 percent of the shares, Cathay Pacific Shihua accounted for 10% of shares, Ningde Times accounted for 8% of shares, Qianfang Technology accounted for 7.01% of shares, and Hua Finance Industry and Yuyue Medical accounted for 4.99% of shares, respectively. Yuyue Medical, as a general funder, plans to contribute 399 million yuan with its own funds. The board of directors of Ants for the elimination of money is composed of seven directors, and the board of supervisors is composed of five supervisors, including representative supervisors of employees and shareholders' supervisors.

If the above information is true, it means that the seven major shareholders who spend money in Chongqing Ant will further increase the proportion of registered capital. Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance will carry out consumer finance-related business after its establishment. The business scope is: RMB business: (1) issuing personal consumption loans; (2) accepting deposits from domestic subsidiaries and domestic shareholders; (3) borrowing from domestic financial institutions; (4) issuing approved financial bonds; (5) domestic Interactual lending; (6) consulting and agency business related to consumer finance; (7) acting as an agent to sell insurance products related to consumer loans; (8) fixed-income securities investment business; and (9) other business approved by the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

It should be pointed out that the news that Ants were approved for fund-raising was coming out at a time when the Ant Group Sprint Science and Technology Innovation Board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange were on the market. With the suspension of the ant group's IPO last November, there has been no public progress in the news about ant's money-removing. In a report at the time last September, Financial Tiger pointed out that the approval of the establishment of Ant Fund-Ran will bring about great changes to its current consumer lending business of the group, and does not even rule out the possibility of future divestiture or business restructuring. There is also the possibility of dividing flowers and borrowing into Ant Consumer Gold in the future.

It is also analyzed that Ant Group's original consumption finance-related business is facing certain public opinion pressure. The contradiction mainly focuses on its leverage ratio and the risk of excessive concentration of business. The acquisition of money-free licenses has a significant benefit in mitigating such risks. In addition, with the implementation of the new regulations on the supervision of small lenders, Ant Group can gradually transfer some of its consumer financial business through small loan companies to consumer finance companies to enhance business compliance and sustainability.

On September 14 last year, industrial and commercial changes occurred in Chongqing Ant Shangcheng Small Loan Co., Ltd. and Hua, the main operating entities Chongqing Ant Xiaowei Micro Loan Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Ant Future Technology Co., Ltd., and the holding parent companies of the three companies are all limited shares of Zhejiang Ant Micro Financial Services Group. The division was officially changed to Ant Group. At the same time, Yu Shengfa, the legal person and chairman of the two main operating companies, withdrew and changed to Huang Hao. Hu Xi, the former legal person, executive director and general manager of Hangzhou Ant, withdrew and changed to Ni Xingjun.

With the change of the regulatory environment of financial technology, after Ant Group's IPO was suspended, there was a lot of industry attention about how its business would be reorganized. According to the previous prospectus data of Ant Group, its lending business has developed into its largest source of income. In the first half of 2020, its loan revenue increased by 59% to Rmb29 billion, accounting for 40% of the group's total revenue. Ant Financial has more than 700 million Alipay users per month, and it puts cooperation with traditional banks at the core of its strategy. In the 12 months to June 2020, its loan platform has granted credit to about 500 million people, and the annualized interest rate charged for smaller loans is about 15%. Borrowing money similar to credit cards and unsecured consumer loan products was the basis of Ant Group's plan to seek a valuation of $225 billion in the upcoming IPO.

Ant Group has been interviewed twice by regulators before. According to the content of the second interview, one of them is to improve corporate governance and strictly rectify illegal credit, insurance, financial management and other financial activities in accordance with prudential supervision requirements. Since then, news about the business reorganization and rectification of Ant Group has been circulating in the market.

In late December last year, two people directly familiar with the matter said that Ant Group was considering integrating most of its online financial business into a holding company, including the consumer loan business.

In late December last year, two people directly familiar with the matter said that Ant Group was considering integrating most of its online financial business into a holding company, including the consumer loan business. In early January this year, it was reported that Ant Group was planning to restructure its consumer credit business in order to continue to lend nationwide under new regulations, otherwise it might severely restrict Ant Group's most profitable business. This is part of an ant group's comprehensive assessment of its corporate structure. Ants hope to gradually shift their main consumer credit business to a new consumer financial sector with the power to operate nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter. In theory, switching to the consumer financial sector will enable Ant Group to continue lending nationwide without waiting for a new license plate.

Alibaba revealed in the financial report on February 2 that there was a major uncertainty about Ant Group's IPO plan, and Ant Group contributed $735 million in profits in the third quarter. Also in early February, it was reported that Ant Group planned to divest its consumer credit data business, and Ant Group became a more tightly regulated financial holding company, which was a key part of Ant Group's business restructuring. Ant Group declined to comment.

Zhang Yong, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors and CEO, said in a financial teleconference on February 3 that once Ant Group has completed the relevant regulatory procedures for approving the plan, market information will be updated in time. Financial tiger also noted at that time that when talking about Ant Group's consumer credit business, Zhang Yong pointed out that in China's retail market, payments made with flowers account for only a small proportion of the total credit amount, and the vast majority of consumers associate their payment accounts with multiple sources of funding, including credit cards. It's just one of the financing channels. Although the changing regulatory environment applicable to financial technology and Internet platform companies poses recent challenges to Alibaba, it believes that it is an important opportunity to reassess and improve business practices.

2/27/21 09:58,"Medallia Upcoming Earnings - 3/4/21 Following up on my Medallia (MDLA) post about a month ago, I wanted to talk about earnings and a good entry point coming up. Previously I had bought in at $32 but sold at $42 when I liquidated my account to move from Robinhood to TD Ameritrade. Now using ThinkOrSwim I can add some fancier pics:

[Whenever there is an earnings call, there is usually a selloff and then a rally.](https://preview.redd.it/bft6hefzswj61.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c4fbb0ed24837f949e3ad2b9e9b5fc6efb691d)

Medallia has been trading at what I think is a discounted $40 from their previous $48 high. However, looking back at their previous earnings, there is always a run up and then a crash. I think with their earnings coming up on March 4th, I'll buy the ensuing dip. They'll probably finish 2021 above $50, maybe even $60.

Medallia is a billion dollar tech unicorn that IPOed in 2019 and does survey/marketing analytics. I use the software at the bank I work for. Unlike a lot of tech unicorns that IPO and are unprofitable, Medallia isn't hemorrhaging money and even has a positive balance sheet (assets higher than debts).

2/27/21 07:56,"Why I bought OSK stock - DD Oshkosh Truck Corp (**OSK**) might be a stock that many of you know about currently as they just won a huge contract to build the USPS next generation delivery vehicle fleet. Day of announcement I watched the stock rocket up almost 25% in a matter of an hour or so. Over the past week it has given most of this back. I missed the rocket ride because I didn't have funds available that weren't tied up in other things. (To be clear, if I had funds avail, I would have day traded that action. I caught the news when the price was still under $109. I would have paperhanded likely around $120. I'm now talking about a solid 1 to 3 month play here after taking the time to do some research. This isn't about riding another rocket).

With AMC taking a mini moon shot this week I jumped out for tendie nuggets near the high, and moved that all into **OSK**. I bought into AMC planning to hold it for months if need be because to me it seemed a very safe play with a good return potential. I was right sooner than expected. I will buy back in if it dips enough, but for now, I see **OSK** as the same safe play with good earnings potential.

Lets break down why I believe **OSK** will be good to anyone who invests now. Open up its chart and take a look at what you see. You can look at 1mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, 1y or 5y, and you get the same picture. A consistent upward climb. The 5y chart has some up and downs more than the last year; There are a few corrections when the stock gained faster than it's overall average (and then there is the pandemic ""crash"" that every stock dealt with). It's always rebounded and continued the climb. Last year the price doubled. With so many positive factors right now for **OSK** business, I don't see reason to believe it can't do the same again this year.

I fully expect the price to be up 20-25% within 3 months. This USPS contract is huge and I believe it will lead to an overall faster rise than the average trend line. Somewhere down the road I'd expect a correction as the price overinflates. I intend to ride the wave for now and exit long before that happens. Aside from the USPS contract, **OSK** is still a reliable company with solid and knowledgeable leadership.

If you look back thru their news history you don't see negative news. You see again and again awards for most admired company, accolades for being a highly sustainable company, Most ethical, etc. etc. In between those awards news, there is large contract and large contract to military and government. They are well known and well trusted. That's why they win contracts and why they keep winning contracts. They are leading the way with EV trucks and work vehicles, and with Biden pushing to move the USA away from fossil fuels and meet (the newly rejoined) Paris climate accord goals, I only see more demand for **OSK** to produce, supply, and retrofit EV vehicles in the future.

So let me just recap and add other strong bullet points not included thus far:\* Consistent and reliable upward momentum.\* Strong financial health and low debt ratio.\* Highly respected and awarded company.\* Excellent company leadership.\* Highly competitive, if not preferred, supplier for gov't contracts.\* P/E ratio (\~23x) is well below their industry average.\* Earnings growth forecast is >20% ( I believe this is overly conservative actually).

Looking at options, just an example that caught my eye is a 2021/07/16c $105 for 12.60. That would make the break even price just $117.60 - I would be a little amazed if within 140 days **OSK** isn't above $120 minimum. $117.60 is on the low, low end of the price projection. Another gov't contract award or positive news and it's easy to see the stock jump over $140. Even without any news I'm expecting it to cross $125 within 60 days. Increased gov't spending, increased stimulus, the country getting back to work post COVID, increased demand for their products, the list goes on. It seems a smoothly paved and open road ahead for **OSK**, and they seem well positioned to take advantage of it.

I like this stock.",36825,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999432743,True

I pay for Reuters Eikon, it's $1200 / month or something like that. Outside of Bloomberg Terminal, it's the most used financial data tool in the world. Bloomberg dominates the US...but Eikon dominates Europe.   


I've seen a post from yesterday claiming there is high short interesest in $RKT. However, the OP wrote some misleading / straight up incorrect information.

&#x200B;

1. Claims that the CEO owns 95% of the shares
2. Claims that 35% of the outstanding shares are shorted

&#x200B;

What are the facts?

1. Does the CEO / Founder own 95% of the shares? Let's check ownership in Eikon.
2. Is there high short interest / probability of a short squeeze?

&#x200B;

1. Institutional Ownership overview here shows that there is no possible way the CEO / Founder owns 95% of the outstanding shares according to the post in reference.

&#x200B;

2. Eikon works with a company called StarMine. They have a model that applies scores to a potential short squeeze. When Gamestonks was under $30 in January....the Short Squeeze score for Gamestonks was 100....yes 100 out of 100. 

&#x200B;

$RKT has a score of 45.   


what does this score mean?  


The current 1-100 percentile rank of the security versus all other US traded stocks on the Short Interest Indicator, based on volatility and liquidity. A score of 91 indicates that only 9% of stocks have a higher likelihood of a significant relative price rise in the next 30 days.

Devoted cruisers are chomping at the bit to return to the seas and rivers. Their options are extremely limited this year, so many of them are making plans to sail in 2021.

And so, even despite the coronavirus pandemic, cruise companies and agency networks say bookings for 2021 are rising, giving the industry a much-needed ray of hope for recovery.

In business updates in recent weeks, both Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said 2021 bookings are “within historical ranges.” In fact, NCLH President and CEO Frank Del Rio said he was “astonished” by the booking strength.

The biggest news of this whole shebang, a couple can go 12 months with 0 yes ZERO revenue and still survive. After recent equity raises, Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Group have enough liquidity to weather up to 12 more months in an essentially zero-revenue scenario, William Blair said in a note.

3/4/21 09:22,"PepsiCo (PEP): Is the Market undervaluing this Dividend Staple? Okay so here are my thoughts. Behind Nestle, PepsiCo is the biggest company in it's sector by revenue. It also follows Coke stock fairly closely. But what made the difference this last year was how these two comparable soda giants fared during covid 19.

KO or Coke performed extremely poorly and made less money yoy. It's payout ratio for its dividend was touching 94%. Meaning they only had 6% left over after paying out their shareholders. That's not a lot of money to do much of anything with. ESPECIALLY in an industry that needs to move towards new products with the decline in popularity of Soda.

To compare with PepsiCo, which even during the pandemic found a way to make more revenue in 2020 than in 2019.

To give you specific numbers, in 2018 was an increase in total revenue by 1.79% compared to 2017. In 2019 it increased 3.87% compared to 2018, and in 2020 increased a 4.78% which might I remind you that this increase happened during the pandemic. Now why did PepsiCo do well against their main rival coke?

To answer this in simple terms their portfolio was more diversified than coke's and they focused on releasing new and more popular products as well as packaged food which saw a huge boost in sales from ""Toilet Paper Bandits"" or panic shoppers stocking up on bags of fritos, lays, cheetos, and on the healthier side of things Quaker Oats and other products. Until recently most people thought coke stock was king between the two companies but I believe 2020 may have put pepsi on the podium as our clear winner of the Cola Wars.

Pepsi has a dividend yield of 3.12% and a payout ratio of 79.88%

Coke has a dividend yield of 3.35% and a payout ratio of 93.85%

With the payout ratios so high I am a little concerned for dividend increases for both but I would be shocked if coke raised it any more than they had to to keep their dividend status.

Share price:

I see PepsiCo valued at $154.36 a share
Trevis Evaluation puts then at $150.16 which I believe is low but close to a 20 dollar per share increase or more either way.

This is an upside of 18.46% not including dividends.

And I calculated Coke to be valued at $52.72 a share.
Trevis Evaluation puts it at $55.48 which is more than I calculated.

Taking the higher of the two numbers this leave a share price upside of around 11.00%

There are many other reasons I believe Pepsi is going to be the better long term pick like how they released the new cocktail mixers neon Zebra (which I would love to try) to take some of the cocktail mixer marketshare. Which the mixer market tops 858 MM$ and an industry that grew 35% just last year. Cocktail culture is coming to North America and in the United States and Canada we are heavily accepting these delicious mixers that are premade and easy to make.

What are your thoughts on these two companies or their sectors in general? Do you think PepsiCo is undervalued? Or do you think Coke is still a better buy? Let me know in the comments.

3/4/21 07:19,"CHIP SHORTTAGE - REAL OR MEMOREX  

I imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.

In that time period, I watched the ""chip"" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.

My companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an ""Anti Dumping Tax"". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, ""a radioactive"" product.

>***Side Note:***

LG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.

Back in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :

* Production capacity of each factory.
* Daily production numbers of computers.
* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, ""absorbed"" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.
* Mother Nature and her wrath ""overseas"".

The computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.

A few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire ""Technology Sector"", although it did not exist yet.

>**Points:**

* Always ask ""Why"".
* ""Due Diligence"" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.
* In this market, ""What goes down, usually comes up"". Write that down.

3/4/21 04:11,"OSTK Light DD. Suggesting a quick 10% gain that might not be suitable for more retarded, risk seeking investors.

OSTK crushed earnings but dropped something like 16% last Tuesday. This is in keeping with the overall market sentiment- bond yields are increasing, beer virus stock winners are returning to a normal world etc etc. 

The last time they reported earnings, it was a similar fiasco. Up like 20% early hours on huge revenue boost then actually finished red like 20% as investors realized they have no inventory. (Inventory has since before more available)

It's a day trader's top stock pick because of such crazy volatility. In my opinion, it's never had a chance to find it's true value because it's been squeezed and day traded abusively for two years. 

And- I need to be cryptic with how I say this so I don't get blocked- it's a good play for alternative uhh coin stuff.  Like, if alternative coin stuff keeps pushing at new highs, that would be really good for OSTK's medici ventures. Medici is a small facet of OSTK's revenue, but it's fascinating what they've been accomplishing. They issued a small dividend a year ago that's up 901.88% at the time of this post. (It's not really a dividend. Idk what the fuck it is, to be honest. They just issued it to me and it grew. Ticker is OSTKO if someone wants to explain it to me.)

Their main publicly traded competitor is W. W also had a rollercoaster earnings day. Early hours shot way down (jussst enough to trigger my stoploss order) then corrected way up. I think most of everyone saw they had a 16% run-up on Monday. There's yet to be a post earnings run-up for OSTK.

I might lose some apes here, but I'm going to discuss risk/reward. Most recent extreme low was $47 about a month ago. Most recent high was $110 a couple weeks ago. OSTK is now trading at $65ish. Low volume is below most averages and, given the 🌈  🐻 news on tech sell-off, it seems to be finding support.

Housing market up also bodes well for the furniture industry.

Similar to what RKT has done just for different reasons. Koch Industries just bought a portion of PQ Corp in all cash and now they are going to offer a one time special dividend possibly up to $3.25. 

Current share price is 17.03 so you’re looking at a 19% return by end of March. The board hasnt officially approved it yet but they just did another special dividend back in Dec. and the turnaround time for that was pretty quick. I like easy money as much as the next guy.

I dont really understand what most of this means since I only started eating crayons a month ago but according to retards its a good thing there is so many puts.. OR IS THERE??!?!?!?!!

These numbers barely changed from March 3rd before closing to March 5 pre market, only increased—-> meaning driving the price of gme down because long term option contracts betting against gme, but gme is doing good now and LOOKS even better later so wtf?

**What the fuck? Where are all the hundreds of thousands of put options???**

My guess is that Hedgies are putting in these gigantic orders on gme saying its gonna go down  during lunch hours, when there is least activity thus driving the price of gme down even tho its supposed to be gaining retarded 40% gains everyday due to SI...

These orders all stayed in, the first 10 even 20 minutes of market open..I thought they probably won’t change since I just started to actually use bren, but then I look and its way different...

Some of y’all are gonna hate but Ive been watching RKT alongside since this week.. Funny thing is when RKT went up 40% in one day, GME started dropping, Correlation?

Edit2:   the Short Interest on borrowing shares of RKT was 55% the other day March 3rd, RKT went up 40% or so to a high of like $41 on March 3rd... today it went back down to mid 20s and the borrow rate is still 44%??

 Citdadel has short positions in both, they cant win on both sides so they had to sell RKT positions, increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because  “ dividend news”  finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it, making citadel insane profits on the way up  AND on the way down .. Mind you, the dividend news was from Jan 29 I Believe, so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders.... and so apes bought it and some sold for loss, others sold for good gains, but others are just holding because they too now like the stock. It has 44% Borrow Rate and only 300k shares available as of 2PM EST March 4th..

So they make money on RKT going up and down,  continue short laddering GME to keep the price suppressed. IT all  worked in their favor but RKT doesnt seem to be dropping below $25,or heck it wont even go below $20 because ill buy more LOL! some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up, like me hehe, 58 shares Wassup baby

Mind you beginning of March, and even at its IPO RKT was only at \~$20.. During their IPO they only put out 1/3 of their float because there wasn’t a high demand, the news “oddly didnt cover or care about their debut” which is the same gay bears  were dealing with, meaning in the future more shares are to be put out but until then cant the price of its shares quadruple if shorts are forced to cover?? Especially with such low amount of shares avail to short and such an insanely massive borrow rate???

Positions - (This amounts to 50% of my portfolio)

1. 3/19 - 5x 23C
2. 3/19 - 24x 27C
3. 3/19- 30x 26C

AMKR provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. It provides essential services to companies that deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and works with big names such as NVIDA, Sony, Tesla

***1.*** ***Financials are great***

5B of revenue, 5B Cap, criminally low P/E of 17.7

Okay, but what about other companies in semi-cons. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17.  AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79. This alone tells you how  undervalued this company is. Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

The company is constantly reducing it’s debt and increasing operating income and it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends too.

Low volume

Great financials

***2.*** ***Company is in a hot, growing space.***

Semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board.Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon..

***3. Outlook is great:***

last earnings call says that everything is going great and growing HUGE -

“Okay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor’s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021”

Financial highlights:

To summarize:

1. Great outlook
2. Best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. Great revenue and P/E
4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today
5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space

**Background**

**Academy Sports + Outdoors** is an American sporting goods discount store chain. It has corporate offices in the Katy Distribution Center in [unincorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unincorporated_area) western [Harris County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), United States, near [Katy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy,_Texas) and west of [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston).

Here's some information I found from another DD about ASO, I had to put it in.

A major point of interest in this company is its gun sales. So long as ASO continues to go down the path of marketing and selling guns, they will continue to grow, especially in todays climate. Gun sales are up in January from previous months, with the third-highest monthly total of gun sales on record ([Gun sales surged 80 percent in January, data shows - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)). On top of that, the number of NICS Firearm Background Checks is up 30.53% from last year’s monthly average, from 3,307,943 background checks per month in 2020 to 4,317,804 in January 2021 ([NICS Firearm Checks: Month/Year — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)).

3/5/21 15:55,"NVAX Update: Confusion and panic is driving the latest selloff - NVAX is a massive bargain at $155/share. Time to load the boat 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ***Tldr: NVAX is down over 35% in the last 3 trading sessions and 53% since the ATH 17 days ago and now has a market cap of $11.8B. This is an enormous overreaction for a company that has reported the highest efficacy to date against the original COVID variant (95.6%) and has several billions of dollars in advanced purchase agreements for 2021. If trading at close to 1X price/sales (anticipated) isn’t enough, NVAX is also the most well positioned vaccine maker to capitalize on the future booster market due to the ability to combine multiple strains in one shot and their excellent safety profile. NVAX is an incredible deal right now at $155/share.*** 

\----------------------------------------

Refer to my previous posts for more background and a more thorough explanation of NVAX’s vaccine, particularly my last post on 1/28.

 

**Recap of how we got here**

* On January 28th NVAX reported best in class interim results from their Phase 3 UK trial (95.6% efficacy against original COVID variant) which led to shares massively increasing over the following couple of weeks, peaking at over $300/share. See summary figure from RA Capital below outlining NVAX's vaccine performance against the competition.
* Since then, several advanced purchased agreements have been confirmed/finalized, and NVAX has secured orders for \~200M doses, which CEO has indicated will be \~$20/dose:
* Additionally, NVAX has confirmed agreements for \~1.4B doses that will be supplied through exclusive license agreements with Japan, South Korea, and India/COVAX.
* NVAX completed enrollment for US/Mexico Phase 3 trial on February 22nd and will likely report interim results in March. 
* Earnings on March 1st provided several important updates around manufacturing and development of a new bi-valent COVID vaccine, however the market reacted negatively likely due to expectations around an update for the UK phase 3 trial completion and US EUA.
* Shares continued to slide over the last 2 days due to broader market conditions closing at $155/share today

**NVAX remains well positioned despite being behind PFE, MRNA, and JNJ**

Based on several comments I’ve seen over the past few days, it seems that many people are not aware that there is a massive market for COVID vaccines outside of the US and that NVAX already has an agreement with the US to provide 110M doses. Yes, the US is vaccinating millions of people every week, but we’ve known for months that NVAX was going to be approved after PFE/MRNA/JNJ and nothing has changed on that front. For the first wave of vaccinations, the US market was never going to be the major revenue generator for NVAX. It was always going to be about the ex-US market for 2021/2022. 

As of today, NVAX has advanced purchase agreements with the following countries that will likely pay top tier pricing, which CEO suggested earlier this week will be \~$20/dose:

* Canada: 52M doses w/ option for additional 24M doses
* UK: 60M doses
* Australia: 51M doses w/ option for additional 10M doses
* New Zealand: 11M doses
* Switzerland: 6M doses

This does not include ongoing negotiations with the EU, which have been [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-novavax/eu-close-to-vaccine-supply-deal-with-novavax-sources-idUSKBN2AB10H) to involve supplying 100M doses with an option for another 100M. There will almost certainly be several more countries that come forward with purchases in the coming weeks. 

During the earnings call on Monday, CEO confirmed that all 8 manufacturing sites are making GMP product, with US and SK performing final fill. This is an important update and it appears that manufacturing will be able to deliver on projected supply of \~160M doses/month once all sites are fully operational in mid-2021.

&#x200B;

**New COVID variants (P.1 & B.1.429) can escape prior immunity to original COVID variants and vaccination with 1st-generation COVID vaccines**

Several lines of evidence make it clear that at least two of the COVID variants in circulation are capable of immune escape. This is a big deal because it means that existing vaccines will be less effective (as we’ve already seen) and will need to be updated in the future. It also isn’t hard to imagine that in another 6-12 months, after more of the population has been vaccinated, that selection pressure will generate additional escape mutants that we'll need to think about. 

Ultimately, this means that we’re very likely going to need updated COVID vaccines with some level of frequency. NVAX and MRNA are already working on bi-valent formulations that will cover at least two variants and there’s very good reason to think there will be more updates in the next few years. Due to the nature of their vaccine platform, NVAX is best positioned to take advantage of updated booster shots in the future. I went through this in more detail in my last post, but to summarize:

* NVAX’s high potency allows them to use a very low dose of protein (5µg) in their current formulation and they tested up to 25µg during phase 1 trials with no change in side effects. As a result, they have the “space” to add coverage against several additional variants and have confirmed that they’re already working on this. 
* PFE/MRNA have much less “space” to add coverage against additional variants due to dose limiting toxicity as they’re already relatively close to the ceiling of how much mRNA can be delivered in a dose without causing unacceptable levels of toxicity. Safety issues are already a concern with the existing formulation, particularly for MRNA, which was the subject of a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper ([NEJM paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102131?query=featured_home)). Consequently, MRNA’s bi-valent booster is being developed to cover two variants at half of the original dose to keep the total mRNA at 100µg. Still, safety remains a concern since we see an increase in side effects going from dose 1 to dose 2 due to an unknown mechanism and there are concerns that there will be a similar issue going from dose 2 to dose 3.
* JNJ and AZN’s platform use adenoviral vector platform to deliver the DNA sequence encoding the antigen. Both suffer from the same problem which is that the immune system recognizes the vector and impairs the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations

&#x200B;

NVAX will be able to leverage their best in class platform against new variants and will be able to take advantage of an expedited pathway to get updated formulations approved in the future based on recent FDA guidance ([link](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download)). As a result, future trials will be able to take place much faster, and the speed advantage for mRNA-based platforms will be significantly negated compared to the first round of trials. NVAX is undervalued at $155/share even before considering how massive the revenues for boosters could be. 

 

**NVAX is insanely cheap at an $11.8B market cap**

I haven’t performed any financial modeling so I’m not going to give a price target beyond saying it’s much higher than $155. Instead, I’ll point you to the only four analysts who’ve provided updated price targets since earnings on March 1st:

* Eric Joseph (JP Morgan): $285/share
* Kelechi Chikere (Jefferies): $310/share
* Charles Duncan (Cantor Fitzgerald): $338/share
* Mayank Mamtani (B. Riley): $397/share

For comparison, two other COVID vaccine makers CVAC and BNTX have market caps of $15.2B and $22.9B, respectively. CVAC has no approved products and a COVID vaccine that appears significantly less effective and is at an earlier phase of development. BNTX is the inventor of PFE’s vaccine and shares revenue with PFE. Yes, both CVAC and BNTX are getting a premium for their pipelines, but NVAX has a pipeline as well, with a Flu vaccine that successfully completed phase 3 prior to the pandemic and an RSV vaccine in clinical development, both of which are candidates to be made into combination vaccines with their COVID vaccine.

3/5/21 12:41,"NNOX shorted, FDA 510k incoming, disruptive technology, stock at insanely undervalued price, was shorted by Citron in the past (so was Tesla) Edit: It seems that, whether it be fomo or just the shitty day the market had today, most people have strong feelings against NNOX. Read my replies, and my half ass DD, and look into the company yourself. You have to be optimistic and not shut down anything that’s not being pumped and not make yourself believe disruptive technology doesn’t exist. I was attempting to help point out a ridiculous terribly undervalued stock but if disruptive tech isn’t for you then that’s ok. 

Think of NNOX like like Elon Musk when he was an infant, and you are a couple who is unable to have kids so they go adopt a kid, and turns out you adopted the soon to be richest man alive. An infant company soon to become one of the largest disruptive technology businesses of the decade, that just graduated from middle school and is off to high school where he will decide what he wants to do with his life. When he graduates, he asks to be able to comeback home after college, and your job as his parent is to say yes or no. He really wants to and says he will never talk to you again if you say no. As he seems to be worth nothing and no benefit to society, you say no. Turns out he goes off to college and graduates and becomes the richest man alive. The only issue is, he won't talk to you, or even look at you, because he's to busy being a multi billionaire. You are now wishing you took him back in after college. Don't not take in this business once it graduates from college (and begins manufacturing and selling product).

&#x200B;

I have been in NNOX since the beginning, and wish I bought at the price it's at now every time it dipped. Although it is the Tesla of x-rays, NNOX has no sales and are waiting on FDA approval which is to be obtained within 30 days (after they had a additional information request). The graph shows the hype when it first went public, then when it was shorted by Citron, and then its live demo, and then retail investors (who own majority of the float) getting bored and selling / panic selling in current market conditions. Not necessarily a DD but something that you ought to look into. Insanely disruptive technology that early investors get rewarded for holding before the hype takes over and goes to the moon (like Tesla) when Citron shorted it. Nano-X Imaging Ltd is the official name and NNOX is the ticker.

3/10/21 02:14,"Ride the NIO to the moon up more than 10% already HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers Li Auto Inc LI.O, Nio Inc NIO.N and Xpeng Inc XPEV.N plan to list in Hong Kong as soon as this year, tapping a growing investor base closer to home, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The trio each aim to sell at least 5% of enlarged share capital in the Asian hub, the people said. Based on their New York market capitalisation on Monday, proceeds could reach $5 billion.

The companies have been working with advisors on the sales which could begin as early as mid-year, said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.

Li Auto, Nio and Xpeng - which have raised $14.7 billion in U.S. markets since 2018 - declined to comment. U.S.-listed shares of the three automakers rose between 3.7% and 5.3% in early deals.

The plans come as the trio increase capital raising efforts to fund technology development and expand sales networks, to better compete in the world's biggest EV market where U.S. peer Tesla Inc TSLA.O is boosting sales of its China-made vehicles.

This year is set to be crucial for EV makers to seize market share as the industry expects China sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) to jump almost 40% from last year to 1.8 million units.

""Despite much richer financial resources now compared with a year ago, EV start-ups still need to invest heavily in next-generation technology,"" said analyst Shi Ji at Haitong International. ""Exploring a secondary listing much closer to their home market, if any, is a good move.""

Selling shares in Hong Kong would also add the trio to a slew of New York-listed Chinese firms seeking a presence on more local exchanges amid Sino-U.S. political tension.

The rising number of such listings ""has enhanced the status of Hong Kong's capital markets globally, and also helped issuers reach higher valuations and raise more capital,"" said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset.



TRACK RECORD

Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.

Li Auto and Xpeng went public in the United States mid-last year so will likely apply in Hong Kong for a dual primary listing, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter.

As per Hong Kong's dual primary listing rules, firms are subject to full bourse requirements in Hong Kong and a second exchange, but are not bound by the two-year condition.

Xpeng is also considering a third listing on Shanghai's STAR Market for new-economy firms, said two other people.

""In the long run, it's helpful for consumer-focused companies like us to connect with domestic capital markets and domestic investors,"" Xpeng President Brian Gu told Reuters last week, declining to comment on any Hong Kong listing plan.

""This is the direction we should pay attention to.""



GOING GREEN

China's government has heavily promoted NEVs - such as battery-powered, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars - in response to chronic air pollution, spurring interest from technology companies and investors alike.

Last month, Reuters reported telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL plans to market EVs as early as this year. nL1N2KW0HV

China forecasts NEVs will make up 20% of its annual auto sales by 2025 from around 5% in 2020.

Domestic vehicle deliveries last year totalled 32,624 by Li Auto, 43,728 by Nio and 27,041 by Xpeng. That compared with 147,445 vehicles by Tesla, industry data showed.

During their expansion their careful selection of store locations “has been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation. “ (From Wikipedia). They’ve been in the business for over 50 years now and looking to grow under new owners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 

As a proud Texan and frequent customer of Academy, I can say that Academy has a huge advantage in the Houston area. Their outdoor competition consists of Recreational Equipment Incorporated (Smaller and most expensive) , Bass Pro Shops (Bigger selection, but less locations) , and Gander Mountain (Closed 100 stores after bankruptcy) While on the Sporting Goods side they compete with Sports Authority (bankrupt) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (only in malls). They have a good grip on the Houston area and are continuing expansion. 

I’m not going to do a deep dive into financials but I’ll focus on the three major points about the company. Debt, EPS Growth, and ROE. The company has been able to smash earnings throughout the Pandemic and their YoY growths have been incredible to say the least. However, to get this kind of growth, they had to take on debt to subsidize their growth. The shorts are betting that this is the downfall of the company but they aren’t thinking about the long-term effects of taking on this debt. They’re using it for considerable expansion in a time where everyone else is shutting down their stores to cut costs and Academy is taking it as their huge opportunity to expand. They have been able to successfully cut down on debt through the issuance of Senior Notes and Secondary Stock Offerings
just recently so they are making all the right moves to make sure the debt isn’t holding them back. The third and final point is their 24% ROE, I shouldn’t have to explain what this means other than you should be excited about their incredible margins.

In the future, we may see their expansion slow slightly because real estate costs will rise inevitably as the country reopens but they were able to successfully take advantage of this opportunity thanks to the nifty work of Ken Hicks and the rest of the board. While new properties will rise in value I think they will still have good growth. The Reopening means more business though as people return to their brick and mortar locations and even more in-store pickup rather than people ordering items from Amazon or EBay. They believe that the hobbies that people picked up will continue to drive sales (I can attest, Frisbee Golf is basically a subscription service to new disks considering how bad I am) and of course the main thing people mention on here is their firearms. I can’t see what’s a better retail recipe right now than Guns, in Texas, during national unrest, while the government is giving people more money to buy guns and ammo. 

Not that I’m a huge fan of national unrest, but Academy’s widespread gun sales and healthy variety are great for sales. Some stores have 4 whole aisles filled up with all the .38, 12 gauge, and .44 ammo anyone could ever need while other stores feature only 3 aisles because they need more aisles for fishing equipment in the summer. While unrest maybe a problem on a national level, Academy stands to profit hugely being one of the largest firearms retailers in the American South. Also, since Spring is upon us they will see upticks in sales for camping and fishing equipment as well as general sports sales. 

These factors are contributing to interest in the stock from both the shorts and retail investors alike. Today’s bullish nod from Barron’s with a $30 price target and rising momentum on this subreddit will make ASO a stock to watch in the upcoming weeks. I’m not trying to recommend that you buy the stock, but I’m giving you information to give you a different look at Academy as more than a simple short squeeze opportunity. Before buying the stock yourself, do more DD  to get a better feel for the company and consider the risks that investing contains. Best of luck to y’all in your endeavor for big tendies.

TLDR: Gun sales are rising and Academy is a major retailer. Have a huge advantage over competition in Texas and they have expanded throughout the pandemic. Excellent EPS growth, top-tier Return on Equity, and the debt situation is being remedied. Bullish nod from Barron’s and momentum on WSB is setting up a huge breakout.",39736,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.995791674,True

# Chekov's Shotgun

[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzd9js/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/?sort=new) we explored this stock to a small degree.  The adventure was personal and I appreciate you listening.  One person pointed out my ellipses were excessive. Thank you for that.   Another person told me I was retarded.  Thank you for that.  Many people were encouraged by my lack of financial literacy and tin foil hat philosophy. This is concerning.  I can, however, only assure you that when the MathChads (u/pennyether, u/manponzi)  and a Cartesian Ghost Aka Godfather Aka Hall9000 Aka /u/jn_ku showed up and told me that I wasn't entirely stupid.

**I figured I was on to something.**

My argument is this -

**1 -** GOEV is oversold.  It is still well below the 20day MVA.  Macromarket forces have been pushing this down more than it deserves.  There is probably some sort of effort to get out from underneath a falling piano of EV hype + SPAC disgust.  I believe that Canoo is farther along than many other plays.  CanooBros will chime in and tell you all about it.

**2** \- There is a solid amount of Short Interest.  Ortex tells us that the short interest increased to 9.2 M shares up from 8.5 Million shares. Data suggests the shorts are in from 17-20.  This is the zone we need to be in..Utilization is at 100 which means that shorts are either recycling shares, ortex doesn't know where the shares are obtained from, or MM are utilizing naked exceptions to provide shares. ^(Or there is naked shorting. Shhhhh)

**3** \- There is an upcoming catalyst of a Motor Press Guild (AKA real shit) is hosting a digital conference with big names like VW, JEEP, Honda, Acura, Fisker, Karma and Canoo.  Fisker and Karma are lining up for the luxury sedan crossover SUV and won't be competing with Canoo.  Canoo seeks to disrupt the market by designing a skateboard where different vehicles will be built on top of.  Again CanooBros tell us all about it below.  They have now detailed what the reveal is and it is ""*Canoo Pick-up Truck world premiere presented by Tony Aquila, Executive Chairman, Canoo with Bryan Biniak, Founder & CEO, Connected Travel*"".  Whatever it is, we need something that revalues the company.  IMHO if they discuss manufacturing and delivery date. You might be able to move out of the basement. We'll see.

# Pulling Its Trigger

The Data in the table below was aggregated by /u/pennyether and was first brought to my attention by  [u/manpozi](https://www.reddit.com/u/manpozi/) .

The way you should read this is what's known as delta hedging.  Simply put when market makers sell an options contract they must purchase a certain number of shares to remain delta neutral.  This is figured out by magic math.  But as the price moves towards the strike price and the date market makers must purchase more and more shares.

|**Price Point**|**#Shares Delta Hedged**|**Float %**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**11**|**1,748,226**|**1.75%**|
|**12**|**2,036,243**|**2.86%**|
|**13**|**4,032,127**|**4.03%**|
|**14**|**5,232,170**|**5.23%**|
|**15**|**6,422,140**|**6.42 %**|
|**16**|**7,581,094**|**7.57 %**|

\*\*This table will fluxuate as the options chain moves around. \*\*

What's important here is that there is relatively low free float and a decent amount of shorting going on and based on Ortex Data the shorts are out of cheap ammo.

This is tactical warfare.  Bigger forces are already at work setting this up.  Some whales are giving shorts enough rope to hang themselves with.  With the EV truck announcement.  All it takes is one quick shove in the right direction...

According to [u/manpozi](https://www.reddit.com/u/manpozi/) 13617 Calls were placed vs 1063 Puts today... that's 10x Call VS Puts.. Giddyup.

3/11/21 05:11,"$OPK : OPKO Health’s Convertible Bonds that are often used by shorts to fear monger “$200 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of the Company, will pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 4.50% per annum” The conversion price of these bonds is $4.22 which is a discount of the current stock price. The number of shares that these bonds would be converted to is a little over 470,000 shares. This also states that convertible bond holders are receiving 4.5% interest annually which is a healthy number when considering other bond offerings. As a result of the healthy interest, it would be assumed the bond holders would not elect to convert and instead choose to receive the healthy interest year over year.

“The Notes will be convertible into, at the Company’s election, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock” This gives OPKO Health the opportunity to use the profits generated from the unforeseen pandemic revenue and pay off the bonds in cash. This would lower shares outstanding and help minimize dilution.

“The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to February 15, 2022, but may redeem the Notes, at its option, on or after February 15, 2022 if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the Notes for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.” This states that OPKO Health can close out these convertible bonds anytime after 2/15/2022 if the stock price is above $5.48 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days.

So now that the facts of the convertible bonds are laid out, I want to share my thesis off of my DD. This is one idiot’s opinion and should not be taken as advice. These convertible bonds act as insurance for anyone that holds them. The convertible bond holders are able to open massive short positions to hedge against $OPK defaulting on their loan. If $OPK defaulted, their stock price would plummet, and the bond holders would lose out on their principal they paid for the bonds but they would make a much larger amount of money on their short positions. If the opposite happens and $OPK reaches full potential and the stock price rises gradually, the bond holders will slowly cover their short positions and will simply cash in on their convertible shares or the cash, whatever $OPK elects to give. So we have big money players with hand in both the short and long positions and they don’t care which way the stock price goes because they will make a lot of money either way.
The catch here is that $OPK has done great work in the past year and was profitable in 2020. They are accumulating cash and will hopefully be able to pay of the convertible bonds in cash. The pandemic was unforeseen, and things have changed. Some convertible bond holders have most likely been covering their short positions and going long, while others still might be hedging against their bonds that they hold.
Long story short, February 2022 will be when $OPK can free themselves from the manipulation from these bond holders. The biggest thing though is that these bond holders know their time is limited to close out their short position. They have been gradually doing so and we have seen 40,000,000 short shares be covered in the past few months. These bond holders are hoping the true value of $OPK can be suppressed until they have enough time to cheaply cover their hedged short positions. The main take away is that $OPK can close out these bonds with cash. This would mean if stock price were to correct to fair values, they may lose on covering their shorts combined with $OPK paying off the bonds in cash and not shares.

I say let’s squeeze them out of their rigged game and make them actually feel the pain of losing in the market. We need diamond hands that have enough DD to know that $OPK is extremely undervalued at these levels. Let’s make these shorts and convertible bond holders scared of the power of the common people.",40391,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998395741,True
3/11/21 05:08,"Why Deutsche Telekom has a 132% to 194% stock price potential (and is a better buy than $TMUS) Dear fellow retards and crayon-eating apes,

Today I would like to present you my first DD of a German DAX company: Deutsche Telekom, the mother company of $TMUS, which got recently included in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio by legend Warren Buffett. I would like to show you why I think that Deutsche Telekom is even a better buy than §TMUS.

**1) Solid figures, strong strategic market position, and growth outlook. Main growth drivers are an increasing glass fiber rollout potential and its 5G/cell tower portfolio.**

Deutsche Telekom is the biggest European integrated telecommunications company, with some 242 million mobile customers, 27 million fixed-network lines, and 22 million broadband lines. Deutsche Telekom is present in more than 50 countries, with its main business in Germany and US. On February 26, 2021 the Deutsche Telekom published its results for the 2020 financial year:

* Increase in **revenue of 25.4 percent to 120.1 bn. $ /101.0 billion euros**
* Adjusted **EBITDA AL increased by 41.6 percent to 41.7 bn. $/ 35.0 billion euros**
* **+388,000 broadband customer** additions in Germany
* Larger T-Mobile US records **5.5 million postpaid customer additions**
* Guidance for 2021: **adjusted EBITDA AL of around 37 billion euros** (44.1$) and **free cash flow AL of around 8.0 billion euros (9.5 $)**

The **earnings forecast shows a growth of roughly 13.2% per yea**r over the next years. The general outlook is positive.

**2) Market capitalization of Deutsche Telekom is far below its fair value with a 132 to 194% stock price potential**

Based on 2020 figures, the industry ratio of market capitalization and annual revenue for the big US players lies in a range between 1.24x to 2.24x, with a Top 3 average of 1.77x:

* **$TMUS T-Mobile US**: 153.2 bn. $ market cap / 68.4 bn. € annual revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **2.24x**
* **$ VZ Verizon Communications:** 234.5 bn. $ market cap / 128.3 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.83x**
* **$T AT&T Inc.**: 212.8 bn $ market cap / 171.8 $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.24x**
* **Deutsche Telekom:** 91.5 bn. $ market cap / 120.1 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **0.76x**

A fair value for Deutsche Telekom based on the Top 3 industry average of 1.77x would lead to a **fair share price of** **44.64$/37,53€,** which is a **premium of 132%** compared to the current share prices of 19.22$/16,16€. Applying the ratio of its subsidiary §TMUS of 2.24x would even lead to a **stock price potential of 194% resulting in 56.5$/47.50€ share price**. The price-to-earnings ratio is 17.6x and below the industry average of 25.3x (source: [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st/)).

**3) The market capitalization of US subsidiary TMUS is worth 65.9 bn.$ - so the remaining business of Deutsche Telekom is worth half its revenue!**

After the Sprint-merger, Deutsche Telekom owns 43% of all shares of its subsidiary TMUS, with an option to buy the remaining 8% from Softbank until June 2024 (half of the shares for 06/2020 TMUS stock price of roughly 100$). Based on today’s value, the TMUS participation is worth 65.9 bn. $, which is already 72% of Deutsche Telekom's overall market cap. So, the remaining international business of DT with **51.7 bn. $ revenue is only evaluated 25.6 bn. $!**

**4) The analyst outlook is very promising, showing a conservative 27% upside potential over the next 12 months**

Based on 13 analyst reports, the 12 months forecast shows a possbile stock price of 24,40$/20,50€, which is a premium of roughly 27% to today's stock price. The range across all analysts is between 20.23$ (Deutsche LB) and 29,25$ (JP Morgan Chase) including 12 Buy and 1 Hold recommendations.

**5) A high dividend yield of roughly 4% over the past 20 years makes it the most stable and reliable German dividend stock.**

**6)** **Risks:**

To me, a comprehensive DD should also cover the risks involved, especially when outlook and forecast seems too good to be true,

* During the dot-com bubble, Deutsche Telekom showed a crazy race towards its ATH of 120$/100€ in 2000, followed by a crash down to 12$/10€ within the next two years. This led to trauma for many German shareholders, resulting in lethargic stock performance over the past 18 years. The high dividend yield is also a result of this crash, with management trying to please the remaining stock owners. Since DT is a German symbol of the dot-com bubble, there might be a chance that the stock is simply not reacting to the current, positive news.
* Deutsche Telekom has a high net debt of 127.4 bn. $/107.1 bn. € (2020). However, the recurring cash flow is high, covering roughly 22.2% of its debt. The interest payments are fully covered by the profit (3.1x coverage).
* Currently, 14.5% of all shares are owned by the German government which might hamper potential positive share price developments. However, German economics minister Peter Altmeier is considering reducing the German participation (January 2021). Other privatization cases show a positive stock price effect.

**Summary:**

Based on all information available, I believe that the upside potential overweighs possible downsides. Even a conservative estimate of 24,40$/20,50€ target stock price reflects a 27% price premium. I personally believe that a **fair estimate based on financial analysis would be 44.64$/37,53€, resulting in a 132% stock price performance**. Overall, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not a financial advice. I simply like the stock.",40392,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999564946,True

3/12/21 08:27,"Bull Case for CPNG - Insane Growth Potential if ""growth"" is not an issue CPNG is a South Korean E-commerce company, dubbed, the ""Amazon of Korea"". Bill Ackman said CPNG is one of the best investments he's ever made. Upon closer look, it's very quite clear why he would say that.

Unlike Amazon, CPNG offers free same-day delivery without limiting their available inventory. CPNG has their own private fleet of delivery drivers and fulfillment centers and thus has insane amount of flexibility and control over how they deliver and ship items. Not only that, they are like DASH in that they deliver food and drinks from local vendors.

Their unique ""Dawn Delivery"" service allows users to make orders at night and receive items early next morning. Returns can be processed instantaneously with money refunded as soon as the item is scanned. It's no wonder in such a short amount of time, CPNG has dominated the South Korean E-commerce Market.  


**Contention 1: But South Korea is small!**  
\-South Korea is the 5th largest e-commerce market in the world and is projected to be the 3rd largest E-commerce market after China and the US in the next 5-10 years.

\-They’re quiet about expansion plans, but they have offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Silicon Valley, and Seattle.

\-Also, South Korea is like the Switzerland of Asia. Due to Korea’s relatively neutral political history, many Asian countries don’t have any qualms working with Korea vs. say China or Japan. It's why Samsung, K-pop, BTS etc. have penetrated the global market post-2010s in ways that Chinese and Japanese companies haven’t. In short, a Korean company nowadays has much greater potential reaching South East Asia and the West than China or Japan.  


**Notable Investors:**  
\-Bill Ackman, Softbank, Blackrock, Sequoia Capital, and more.  


**Intangibles:**  
\-A charismatic CEO boosts sentiment. I bought Alibaba at 90 purely on Jack Ma’s charisma. I bought TSLA at 260 (sold too early) purely because of Elon Musk.

\-CPNG’s CEO, Bom Kim, is the most articulate, and innovative CEO I’ve ever seen to come out of South Korea since ever. This guy is cut above—this guy will say he “cares first about his customers” and mean it, but deep down inside, he wants investors to make a lot of money. I know it when I see them. People like Musk, Ma, Jensen Huang, Brian Chesky, and now, this guy.

\-Bom Kim is Korean born, but grew up in the US. He dropped out of Harvard after just 6-months (As a Korean, you have to be a psycho or really believe in your company to do that). Bom interned at BCG, then started a magazine company before started Coupang around 2010.

\-Kim’s motto: I envision a world where people will say, “How could I have ever lived without Coupang”.

  
**Contention 2: Growth stocks are out of favor in a high interest rate environment!**  
\-Possibly a bigger problem. As per many pundits on CNBC and Bloomberg, the growth potential of CPNG specifically will depend heavily on earnings. With the talented CEO and revenue beat year after year, I believe CPNG will make it.  


**TLDR** \- CPNG is the best Korean E-commerce company that has its own robust infrastructure and an articulate CEO that plans to grow its operations significantly in the next year.

2. I'm currently in IL and have been tracking the vaccine data, as of yesterday we are currently at 10.25% of the state fully vaccinated (more than 98.2M doses have been given in the US as a whole). I personally have started to go to the movies again (double-masking) and spent $20+ both times on overpriced concessions to help the company lol. As an AMC Stubs member I get half off on Tuesday's so that's cool I'm happy to do my part.
3. Theaters in Los Angeles are set to reopen this Saturday (not necessarily AMC, but any news of theaters opening up is positive for AMC in this context).
4. AMC seems to have made a deal with WarnerMedia. CEO Adam Aron said their deal would likely reslut in lower fees they will have to pay to rent movies from the studio, thus increasing their gross margin.
5. B. Riley raised their Price Target for AMC to $7.00/share, up from $5.50.
6. Wedbush raise their PT to $6.50/share, up from $5.00.
7. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" comes out this month. I personally will be seeing it in theaters and again buying tendies/soda/candy before the movie starts.

3/14/21 12:16,"NIO - Bull-case investment Thesis, plus Crazy OG-style WSB ""Bet"" Smart Nio investors trade on catalysts. If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).

Now, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day.

**1) Energy**  
On Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day.

Imagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?

Well early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.

**Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**

It'll send Nio's share price to the moon.

**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  
Nio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.

The same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's.

Watch out for an announcement in April.

**Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on ""reddit"". Google ""top reddit stocks"" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long).

Also Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.

**3) What to Do**  
The dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as I believe it'll reach higher than $300 in five years. I'll be buying/selling calls, but not sell my shares.

**4) Community Boost**  
If NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I'll donate to charity and post as an update. I don't want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.

**TLDR** \- NIO is likely to partner with the world's second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past.

**TLDR** \- I'll donate to charity if NIO’s passes $70 per share by April 16.",41389,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999033809,True
3/14/21 04:17,"Coupang Inc DD - The Amazon of South Korea **---------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER------------------------------------------------------------------**

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I’m just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I’m no expectation. I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.

📷

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm sorry I cant reply to any comments, not enough Karma.

But I defiantly agree with the statement that Korea is small compared to the US and they will have to compete with Amazon if they expand to other Countries. Still don't think this means they can't be HUGLY successful in Korea.

Also I'm not sure when they can be profitable. 2024 maybe?

3/14/21 03:48,"The DKNG Legislative Gamble For those in DKNG, there are potentially momentous events coming up in the next few months as state legislative sessions are coming to a close from now through about June. This could explain why there is a lot of unusual option activity around August at the 90c. 

The states in play and their progress on passing sports gambling either retail or mobile:

Texas: Two lawmakers filed legislation this week that would legalize casinos and sports betting in Texas. HJR133 was filed in the House on Tuesday and SJR49 filed in the Senate. The Texas Governor has also voiced support for the bill as well as the Sports Betting Alliance, which represents teams like the Dallas Mavericks, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Rangers. The Sports Betting Alliance has showed favoritism towards online sports betting too. This bill is supported between the two parties and the legislative session runs to the end of May. 

Florida: Legislative sessions are in progress and run to April 30th. The key part of negotiations is the Seminole Tribe of Florida. They offer a heavy endorsement as they run all casinos in the state of Florida. If they’re brought to the table in support of this bill soon, we could see some real pressure as the Governor is open to legalizing sports betting too. Though, as it stands, it doesn’t seem likely in this session. 

Arizona: Session ends on May 28th. Bill passed the House but faces political scrutiny in the Senate. Governor supports the legislation but its chance could end up grim if it gets stalled because of another bill trying to get horse racing on the ballot.

Maryland: Session ends in early-mid April (I think the 12th) Hogan is basically ready to sign this thing. It includes online sports betting too. This one practically a done deal.

South Dakota: March 29th marks the end of the session. The bill in this state easily cleared both the Senate and House. Governor is expected to sign off. 

Kansas: Session ends May 30th. The bill passed the Senate but its now in the House. Lawmakers in Kansas largely support the bill but there appears to be disagreements for who gets the gambling licenses. The Senate bill included 11 or 12 online gambling licenses, of which DKNG is included (of course).

DKNG could have a great year if some of these go through and could have an explosive one if they all do. The pandemic took a toll on these states and they need as much taxes as they can get. Sports betting is one way they can do that and it has bipartisan support across the aisle.

3/13/21 12:53,"Deutsche Telekom Recently I read the DD of [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) on WSB ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why\_deutsche\_telekom\_has\_a\_132\_to\_194\_stock\_price/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why_deutsche_telekom_has_a_132_to_194_stock_price/) ) where he promotes Deutsche Telekom and I am gonna promote that again.

The last couple years Deutsche Telekom has been the most boring stonk you can ever imagine. No volatility at all. BORING. But that is about to change this year. The stonk has potential. When I asked [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) why the stock would change after having a growth of barely 1 euro a year. he answered with the following:

A) Their US subsidiary shows really promising growth figures and a rather high market capitalization (which should reflect in their share price as 43% shareholder as well - at least sooner or later)

B) Finally, the delayed fibre glass rollout in Germany shows some growth and returns

C) Since they are in Germany a de-facto infrastructure monopolist (the competitors need to rent asset usage and maintenance from DTE, 5G is a solid growth driver

TBH these reasons are entirely understandeable and in my opinion corrrect, the results have shown this in their yearly report. A 20% growth in 2020.

Currently the shares are trading at precovid levels without the revenue growth, meaning they are potentially undervalued at this moment from a logical point of view.

Now one of the negative sides of things the user informs us about is debt. Currently Deutsche Telekom has a 100b debt. I disagree about this being a negative thing. As he talks about AT&T I will give AT&T's debt aswell. AT&T's debt is 190B. Other telekom companies have arround the same % of debt. For example the Dutch telekom company KPN has a market cap of 11B and a debt of 10B. The debt of Deutsche Telekom is not unusual in its sector. If anything, its completely normal.

After consindering all of this I see this stock as a value stock. A stock that has potential growth. And I can see you wondering why does it matter that the stock has changed from dividend stock to value stock? I can tell you thats only because of one reason. Options. Options are fucking cheap. Considering this stock has had no volatility for 20 years means that options are cheap as hell. I bought 100 June 17 2022 options with a strike price of 18 for 50 cents each. Currently they sell for 63 cents and thats still fucking cheap.

Now I do see the stock falling with 60 cents considering the ex dividend date at 29-03-2021. But after that I expect a stable growth to 20+ due to all of the reason mr [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) gives.

Keep in mind the stock currently trades at precovid levels while its revenue went up with 20%, and that 20% revenue growth wasnt expected last year, so it will most likely definetly shoot up.

If you disagree with this DD please tell me why so I can potentially get out of this position :P

Edit:

POS:  100 C18.00 17JUN 2022 for 50 cents ea (5k).

First of all wkhs Short interest high as hell  i think 30% ? Someone fact check this? I know apes like short interest high

Some basic DD
Wkhs was supposedly the only EV bid submitted for USPS contract, and President had just said to renew all federal fleets to EV. 

BAM Dejoy post master general gives the contract to OShkosh who submitted a bid not for ev, they even stated in a conference call or was it PR that they are not familiar with EV tech. Now they say they will make a gas vehicle that can later be retrofitted to EV? Lol wtf? Didn’t even submit an EV bid 

So Wkhs shares tanked from 40+ to now 16 levels 

I mean wkhs still has a bunch of orders from UPS, hitachi help with production, RIDE 10% stake in lordstown motor etc. 



Does this mean the  6B USPS contract could be voided? or even awarded to someone else? idk.

NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV. The company was formerly known as NextEV Inc. and changed its name to NIO Limited in July 2017. NIO Limited was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Shanghai, China.
   * ELI12
      * Sells and manufactures a variety of luxury cars
      * Offers a multitude of charging solutions
      * Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car)
      * Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance

**Catalysts**

* European Market Expansion
   * [https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/02/27/chinese-nio-electric-cars-europe/](https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/02/27/chinese-nio-electric-cars-europe/)
      * Nio plants to enter European markets in the second half of 2021 and other onlother internetational markets in 2022. – CEO William Li at an online conference, February 2021.
      * “Analysts suggest that Norway may be the first European market for NIO.
      * ”Nomura analysts predict that it will jump to over $80 within the next few months, if it continues to meet delivery targets.
   * Rapid Clean Tech Movement
   * New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors
   * NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year
   * Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages
*Nio es8 was spotted in Menlo Park, CA this week.

**Analyst Consensus**

**This shows how NIO is undervalued at this time. Here is a compilation of price targets.**

* Morgan Stanley: $80
* J.P. Morgan: $75
* Deutsche: $70
* Bank of America: $70
* Goldman Sachs: $64
* Daiwa: $100

**Why buy NIO…**

* Good growth opportunity
* Good market (Local environment too)
* Good strategic approach
* The banks have price targets way above where it is now (i.e. $45.50 as of 3/12/21)
* Great strategic approach.
* Great management
* Many are calling William Li a genius and the “Elon Musk of China.”
* One thing that NIO has done exceptionally well where Tesla failed is their battery-swapping tech. So as a buyer of a NIO fleet vehicle you have the option to purchase with or without a battery. If you choose not to purchase a battery you can sign up for a battery subscription service by paying a monthly fee and use one of NIO’s battery swap-stations to exchange your run down battery for a fully charged one. Think of it like a gas station but with batteries instead.
   * This is smart of NIO to pursue this type of program especially in China where most individuals aren’t living in large houses with the ability to install a charging station directly into their garage wall. For that reason alone NIO seems like a better choice for an EV vehicle if you are living in densely populated areas with little to no space.
* China’s market share on a global scale is massive and one thing China does often is promote and back their own companies over US. China is very competitive and loves to win and get out on top. In my opinion China wants to produce EV companies that not only compare with Tesla but overall outperform and take a bigger piece of the EV-pie.
* NIO is being touted as China’s Tesla.
* NIO also understands that while people are paying for the subscription service - sometimes they just don’t drive. NIO’s subscription service keeps customers paying month to month even after that initial sale.
* China won’t let their EV companies fail.
* China has stated that they want 25% of all new vehicles sold in the country to be electric by 2025. Currently EV sales are only contributing to about 5%. So in the next four years we’re going to see an EV boom all across China. That means the government would likely be installing more charging stations across the country and possibly kickbacks for citizens who purchase EV.
* It’s no secret that the emissions in China are insane. It sure would be nice for China to be able to come out in a few years and say, “Hey look at how much we improved.” I believe this is exactly what’s going to happen especially when you really look at the policies the Chinese government has put in place for electric vehicles vs. combustion engine vehicles.

**🚀🚀🚀🚀Recommendations🚀🚀🚀🚀**

* **buy NIO calls; lots of volume in the following**
   * **Mar 19 50c (currently $0.68)**

3/15/21 06:07,"Who do us apes hate even more than shorts? Hindenburg Research – and if you don’t hate them yet, you will soon when they attack one of your holdings.

**Who is Hindenburg Research?**

“Hindenburg Research” is a tiny[ 5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) based out of an[ apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.

They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don’t care if they are right or wrong on their “research” because they will profit on their short position regardless.

Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float – these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their “reports”).

Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM – to name a few.

&#x200B;

**Where do they get their research?**

This is the million-dollar question.

They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.

In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on “conversations they had” with undisclosed “former employees” of the company.

Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.

That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don’t imagine she’s going to have too many nice things to say.

&#x200B;

**Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**

Let’s be clear. This is no Nikola.

Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle.

Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a “quiet-period” right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.

Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [“thorough” statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will “absolutely” be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.

&#x200B;

**In summary:**

I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.

In addition, I’ll let you be the judge – should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?

What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged.

I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully *prevent it from happening to you in the future*.

&#x200B;

**I’ll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?**

A 5-man “research firm” ran out of an apartment in New York **or** a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious.

Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn’t close out their short positions get burned this week – and it begins tomorrow.

$RIDE or die baby! #MadeInAmerica

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**

Hindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place – for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first **full-size** electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.

3/15/21 02:50,"$CPNG - Undervalued and Underestimated I called $DIS 6 months ago when it was hovering around $125 and y'all didn't listen. Maybe you will this time.

I have to talk about $CPNG (Coupang aka ""Amazon of Korea"" aka ""Chef Pang"" aka ""C Piddy"") because y'all need to put some respect on its name. It's one of the largest tech companies to IPO on the NYSE ever ($55B) and the largest tech IPO in South Korean history. This isn't just some company. It's THE company. How often do you get a chance to invest in the next Amazon of?

Some of its notable backers are Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, Stanley Druckenmiller, and David Frankel.

Before trying to understand Coupang, you have to understand South Korea as a country.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APE MUST READ

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

South Korea is a first-world country with the 11th largest economy (i.e., GDP) in the world. That makes them bigger than Russia, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, Netherlands, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Poland, Taiwan, Sweden, Belgium, Thailand, Argentina, Nigeria, Iran... you get the point [https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp)

They also have the 7th largest e-commerce market in the world. [https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/](https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/)

It is also the ultimate turnaround story. Up until the mid-1900s, they were a third-world Japanese colony, but in 2021 it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world. And they did this in about 40 years with their focus on tech and industrials as well as entertainment. Samsung, Hyundai, Kia, LG, KPop... (KPop is an international sensation right now - $564M export reported Aug 2020 last year and growing).

Also, just know how advanced they are technologically. They have had RFID chips a decade before us. They've had 5G for years. They have the best e-sports gamers in the world. They are no stranger to the worldwide web.

A big reason why they are so successful is because they are 2nd in the world in how much of their national GDP they spend on R&D.

GETTING BACK TO COUPANG

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$CPNG is only cash flow negative right now because they invested 100s of millions of dollars into their infrastructure allowing them to have 70% of South Korea's population (36 million / 51 million) within 7 miles of their distribution centers. They can only do this because 50% of South Korea's population lives in the Seoul metropolitan area. Yes, 50 fucking percent. 25 million people. That's like 3 New York Cities side-by-side. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul\_Capital\_Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_Capital_Area)

South Korea's annual online sales is $37 billion and e-commerce sales of total retail sales 9.8%. [https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/](https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/)

$CPNG sales went from $6B in 2019 to $12B in 2020 (92% growth) [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/11/korean-e-commerce-giant-coupang-skyrockets-on-ipo/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/11/korean-e-commerce-giant-coupang-skyrockets-on-ipo/)

They also increased their market share from 18% in 2019 to 24% in 2020 (33% growth) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html)

So, if the South Korean e-commerce market grows at a 22.4%, it will be $142B by 2024.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RISKS & REBUTTALS

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They sell mostly their own products - OK they've got strong customer loyalty. Can they expand their business to incorporate more 3rd party sellers in the future? Potential is there.

Low gross profit margin - Retail has always historically been a low profit margin business. Is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service? Absolutely.

Still cash flow negative - Did you see the revenue growth? $6B to $12B in one year. They're a growth company in its early stages. I also mentioned above how they're investing 100s of millions into their infrastructure (distribution centers within 7 miles of 70% of population).

They don't have AWS - It's not a literal copy of Amazon. They are also growing their e-commerce business before focusing on anything else. Sales went from $6B to $12B in one year. They need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else. It's highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years. Their founder is a Harvard drop out.

They dominate only in South Korea - What's wrong with that? Even with the South Korean e-commerce market alone, $CPNG can become a $500B company. They are focused on dominating their immediate market. I'm sure they'll create new services and create new sources of revenue. Once the Korean market is saturated, they'll figure out a way to expand. These South Koreans are smart and good at tech. Don't underestimate them.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VALUATION - PRICE TARGET

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If in 2024, $CPNG has a 40% market share, they will have $57B in sales (Amazon has 37% market share of US in 2020). With a conservative P/S of 4, that puts $CPNG FAIR VALUE at $133 PER SHARE ($57B sales x 4 = $228B valuation). If they are doing well and they have hype, with a P/S of 6 (BABA has 6, CPANG has 7), then $CPNG should be $200 PER SHARE ($57B x 6 = $342B valuation).

And this is if they DON'T CREATE ANY NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. Think about that. No new products or services. Just purely their e-commerce business and it's still going to be worth $150-200 PER SHARE. If they launch an AWS-like thing or maybe another service that's just waiting to be discovered, they're going to do an additional $10B easy with the market share they have so add another $50 to the price targets.

As one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world, $CPNG is not here to stay. It's here. To takeover (South Korea).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin products/services, but this is a bet I am willing to make (one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, Harvard drop out, etc.). I guarantee they will innovate.

Oh and even if it's not them developing something internally, they can always acquire a company. They're going to do billions in profits soon. That is a lot of money.

I'm a little drunk and I'll try to keep this as short as possible. This post is gonna come across like a sob story, lots of bitching and moaning, so apologies if rubs you the wrong way. I'm assuredly going to get roasted hard as fuck for this but whatever, wanted to get things off my chest to hopefully get some support and maybe some apes addressing me as the true retard I am.

**Week of January 15th**

1. Gotten broken up with by a long time girlfriend of mine two weeks before GME exploded the first time. Had come right on the heels of a trip we took together to Fresno. Was absolutely crushed and still am, probably the worst pain of my life. Mentioning this just for timing sake.

2. Have to give my young cat away because I wasn't able to provide a proper situation for him. Was a call I made on my own and I think it was the right one, but was devastating nonetheless. “Man up you fucking pussy!” Yeah I get it, but I raised that fucker from 4 weeks to a year old and he had my entire heart. His name was Shrimp.

3. Have been dealing with a rampant roach infestation at my apartment that has been unaddressed by my landlord. My apartment is pretty spotless and still these demons roam every crevice of my apartment. I've had exterminators come out 3 times, and each time the roaches return like my faith in GME. I live in Koreatown LA, paying $1600 a month which is fucking retarded for Koreatown. I am a musician/music producer full-time, so money is already tight and I signed this lease thinking I was getting a steal – I'm gonna say this a lot throughout this post but I'm a fucking idiot. I also had forced entry into my apartment twice in one week during this period. This has gone completely unaddressed by my landlord and they haven't replied to any of my calls or emails about it. I still get crazy anxiety about that situation, something about your door getting unlocked with a key in the wee-hours of the morning and having no explanation for who it was is super unnerving. Both times I was mid-sleep so I didn't see who or what the fuck was going on. I don't have the money to fight a legal battle so I'm just thugging it out in this fucking shitbox until further notice.

GME starts to explode two weeks later, rode that shit from my cost basis of $60 all the way up to $500 and didn't sell – the true sign of my retardation; I should've stopped here. The most money I've ever had in my possession was about $7,000 – my account skyrocketed to almost 50k at its peak. Ended up riding it all the way back down and selling most of my shares between $90 and $60. Still made out with a little profit which was huge for me at the time so even though I was fucking gutted I tried to look on the bright side. But those weeks from January 15th to early February were an absolute roller-coaster of emotion.  pretty much spent the entirety of february getting stoned out of my fucking mind and doing jack shit.  i was down BAD. silver linings however though, i've been smoking weed pretty much daily since i was 14, i just turned 27 early march.  this whole ordeal got me to completely quit smoking, and i'm 3 weeks clean as of now! thats fucking huge for me.

**End of February / Early March**

I decide to get back in as I see GME start to creep up. Fuck YES, it's happening again and this time I know not to be greedy, I know to take profit and scale out where I feel comfortable; and hold what I think could go further. Well, I ended up making a decent little profit on that run from around $140-280. I didn't play everything correctly and paper-handed a bit along the way, but overall I was happy I made out with a small profit again. Keep in mind I am going full ape through all this shit, literally putting every bit of money I have into $GME. I'm collecting unemployment benefits, but I'm putting every dime into the stock during these periods. This whole time I've also only been paying 25% of the rent each month because I'm able to with the COVID situation, so I have payments to catch up on spanning all the way back to December. In my mind if I was able to keep more of my cash in the market I stood the chance to make much more, right? I'm a fucking idiot, you see where this is going.

**March 10th – Now**

I cashed out and sold at $280 on March 10th (I could be wrong about the timing/date) Hooray! I timed it perfectly. I had about 6k to my name total and I was super proud of myself, I didn't get greedy, I made a little money and although I probably disappointed some apes I was ready to buy back in whenever the bottom came. The catalysts were there and I genuinely believed in it, so I was strapped in. So I did – I YOLO'd all the money I had besides what I needed for food + gas. I believe I bought back in at $260 or so thinking the stock would stick around that area with all the catalysts and potential news around the corner. Then shit started dropping, so I sold for a loss. I bought back in again, thinking THIS was the bottom. NOPE. Once a diamond handed autist, turned to a paper-handed bitch. I had taken a big loss and I needed to find a way to get it back, plus I assumed the stock was going to keep dropping and I wanted to have a good chance to pickup cheap shares so I bought some short dated puts hoping to regain some of my account and have more rocket fuel for when the ACTUAL bottom hit. This is probably my biggest fuckup throughout this entire thing. I lost around $4500 in 2 days. Timed it completely fucking wrong and saw all my GME gains and more wiped away, everything. Your probably wondering how the fuck I managed to lose that much on puts when the stock has been dropping steadily the past few days. I have no fucking clue either, just pure autism I guess. I'm a fucking idiot.

So as it stands, I have pretty much the remainder of my cash in GME AGAIN, my current cost average is $225 and $220 between the two brokerage accounts I have. I put my stimmy in on Wednesday (despite promising myself I'd put it towards a new computer that I need to keep my music alive) and have continued to watch it drop. Stockholm Syndrome + a gambling addiction at its finest. I'm completely fucked. I don't have money to pay rent, I don't have any job prospects that I can see, and because I'm completely self-employed I have an enormous tax bill coming up. I have never been this crushed in my entire life. I am preparing for homelessness as soon as I get out of this roach den, and I'm not sure what the future will hold for me. I haven't contemplated ending it, but its taken every bit of my strength to wake-up everyday realizing how bad of a hole I've gotten myself into.

**WHY I MADE THIS POST** :

If you made it this far, congratulations! You might be as retarded as I am. The reason I made this post was to address what WSB and the apes have meant to me throughout this entire thing.

Since I moved to LA last October I've struggled to make real friends out here and develop a sense of community. It has been a bit of a struggle on that end. But throughout the crushing times of the last two months, I don't think I've **EVER** laughed as hard or as frequently as I have while engaging with you guys in the GME daily threads, the memes you guys make, the high-production value videos, etc. Holy fuck you guys are a hilarious, determined, generous and loving bunch of apes. From donating to the children's hospitals to sponsoring endangered species – the things I've seen here are incredible and truly heartwarming. One could argue this subs blind love for GME is part of why I fucked myself this hard but that's bullshit, I take full ownership of my decisions. You guys and girls have made this easier for me. I cannot express how important the laughter was for me during this time because obviously even aside from GME I've been going through it - as I'm sure a lot of us have. I don't know who the fuck I've turned into, but I'm sitting here a bit teary eyed thinking about what this sub has meant to me and how you people have kept me going in the most uncertain time of my life. I'm still HODLing my shares like the demonic autist I am but whatever happens, I do not regret joining this place for one second. There are people out there with (obviously) much more awful situations than me, so I'm trying to keep things in perspective. Hoping someday soon I can post gain porn and deliver Nintendo Switches to kids in need, maybe even adopt an ape or two. I may stay off this board for the next couple of weeks, but I'm praying each and every one of us lands on the moon in time.",41933,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.838714302,True
3/17/21 02:07,"A Lurker's Appreciation Post - Retirement Account All In I've been watching and participating in this spectacle since late January. I haven't been posting. I lurk on Reddit. I don't post. I do read, however, despite having the comprehension of an ape. The content I've been consuming - the personal stories, the wrinkled-brain analysis, the memes - has been amazing. This truly is a unique community - it's global, inclusive, and (by and large) supportive. It's a great resource for those, like myself, who have jumped into the market with little understanding. GameStop piqued my interest. This community has helped refine that interest into understanding...well, maybe just an interest in one day understanding at least some of what's going on. So, as an ape who has been lurking and learning, I thank all you apes -- from Cornelius to Zaius, from Grodd to Solovar, and of course King Kong himself, DFV -- you apes run the spectrum, and are on the spectrum. You've helped me, the ape from 2001: A Space Odyssey (I think it's an ape, though maybe a neanderthal - apes can't remember details from films), gather my first investment tools. 

On a related note, I put my retirement account into GME. Pretty high cost basis? No. Not considering what's going to happen in the near future. It's gonna be bananas.

3/17/21 04:11,"Embracer Group - Game development and publishing **Preamble**

Embracer   Group is noted on the Swedish First North  exchange which is not as  regulated as ""normal"" exhanges are. There is  also not the same ruleset  for tax in most countries so be aware of this.  It is also said to be  more risky investments.

They operate in the game development and publishing business and I don't really need to dive into the prospect of this sector.

Embracer Group ([EMBRAC-B.ST](https://embrac-b.st/))   is the parent company of several development and publishing business   within the gaming industry and throughout most platforms including   mobile, console and PC.

To name a couple of well known items in their IP inventory:

* Valheim (if you don't know yet this is going to be a catalyst)
* Saints Row
* Goat Simulator

**The company**

They  operate Koch Media, Cofee Stain, Amplifier, Saber, Deca and a group  containing banned chars (similar to a ticker) as operative groups.

They hold 220+ IP's, 59 development studios, the 6 above operative groups with 5500+ people in 40+ countries.

*Strategic plans*

Grabbing from the 2019/2020 annual report page 6 highlights:

* Investment for long-term growth
* Growth through M&A
* Empowerment through decentralization (reference to several dev. and pub. branches)
* Reinvesting profit to increase growth

*Let's see what they've done about it* with referencing their press releases ([https://embracer.com/news-media/](https://embracer.com/news-media/)):

* 2021-02-03: Merge with Easybrain (Mobile games as Sudoku and so on)
* 2021-02-03: Acquires Aspyr Media (Star Wars, Sid Meier's Civilization etc.)
* 2021-02-03: Merge with Gearbox Entertainment Company (Borderlands)
* 2020-11-18: Acquires Flying Wild Hog (Shadow Warrior series)

...

Seems like they took M&A serious.. If you're interested, theres a presentation of the M&A actions here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update\_Feb\_3\_2021-ny.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update_Feb_3_2021-ny.pdf)

We   can't go about without mentioning Valheim. The viking survival game   that is currently running early access on Steam and had over 4 million   buys came February. The game has taken the industry with storm. As of   writing there's 18k viewers on twitch which is close to Overwatch and   Hearthstone.

It was release the 2nd of February through Steam with a 96% positive feedback.

**Financials (*****sort of*****)**

First   looking at the gaming market which has been reported from 2018 to 139   billion USD to 2019 ranging in 152 billions. Estimates for 2022 is  close  to 200 billion.

Second,  insider  holdings. The insiders account for 52.7% of the shares with  35.5% being  on institutional hands. The remainder for trade is 11.8%.

The Q4 report arrrives the 20th of May.

The report is a bit difficult for my smooth brain to compare since the previous year is for 15 months so bear with me.

Net sales grew from \~4603m SEK to \~5249m SEK.

Operational EBIT grew from \~717m SEK to \~1033m SEK.

I'm not yet that experiences in reading the financial reports so I won't bore you with my mistakes. It can be found here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf)

From   my limited knowledge I see increases on almost all areas worth noting   which is also impressive considering that the previous period is a 15   month period (I don't know why).

PLUG power down hard after hours due to news that there are some small accounting errors. I believe this is a great buy in and been meaning to release some DD on it that it is a very underrated stock. Why? They're a legit company and the better of the fuel cell stocks (FCEL for example) with contracts in Europe and Korea.

\- Korea recently invested in them at **30$ a share**. Should be a floor.

\- Energy pull back recent weeks. This is easily a 100$ stock by next year

3/18/21 23:50,"Uncle Bruce, the one trick pony I use to watch this guy, and after watching for a few hours, per day, for over 3 weeks, all I can say is this guy has an agenda, and its not to help people.

Yes, he has stories. Yes, he USE to be a broker, and Yes he's got some decent info about GME.

&#x200B;

He also runs a memebr only Youtube site that makes you pay to make a comment on his page. He only reads super chats, and has NO insight or desire to look at any other stocks his members ask of him. He glances over anything that isn't GME, a complement about him, or just tries to sell him merch.

He's been asked about RKT, he didnt know about it. He was asked about CCIV..never heard of them. He was asked about AMC, and he bashes it, using his own opinion without any Technical Analysis to back it up. He doesnt do any DD, even when it comes to GME. He has nothing but guesses about where GME might go in the future. Can GME get into game streaming? Maybe. Wonder is he's heard about Steam, Stadia, Xbox Pass or PSN? Will GME get into eSports? Wonder if he knows about MTG?  

This guy is nothing but a one trick Pony. Once the GME bubble pops, he's gonna disappear, unless cruises start back up, which they wont for a while. And even then, he's always talking about how he sets up groups to go on cruises with him but only so he and his wife can get a free room. 

Does he know his Poop about GME?  Yes he does. If you're in GME and only GME, watch him. 

Lets be honest, if you're only in GME, then fuck me, why are you investing?

You're better suited to watch Treys Trades, AndrewMoMoney, StockMoe, Max Maher, Matt Kohrs..and really a handful of any other youtubers. Most of these guys are transparent about who they've invested in. 

Not only do  they all look at other stocks, they actually answer their viewers questions, and they educated you.

Bruce (not calling him uncle, cause uncles are suppose to be helpful, like Uncle Ryan) just reads super chats, and tries to sell his personal advice for $400 an hour. How can someone who no longer invests give advice? How can someone that hasn't heard about CCIV, RKT, HCMC, and whatever is at least being talked about all over the place advise people with their money?  Would you go to GME for advise about real estate?

I'm sure I'll get some flack for bad mouthing Bruce, and I'm sure he'll have some sort of excuse or reasons for all this, and I'd say some of  this in his channel but I'm not joining his group and give him money to just glance over Super chats.

3/18/21 22:36,"Confused with $GME over 100% institutional ownership ?, guide how to read ownership filings 🦍🦍🦍 can afford 2.5k a month Bloomberg terminal but can't read.

***Download link at bottom, contains the complete list of 13F, D/G and NP filings for $GME***

Two things, while short positions are not reported in the 13F, as Ms Alexis Goldstein (u/dontfightthevol) has pointed out,  however the PUT options hedgies hold are indeed included.

Institutional Ownership over 100% is not a hedgies conspiracy, Example of other stocks with over 100% ownership such as Paypal and Salesforce

PYPL : Institutional Shares	1,364,784,714 - 116.48% (ex 13D/G)

CRM : Institutional Shares	1,049,782,250 - 114.73% (ex 13D/G)

The over 100% ownership report can be caused by the following

**1. Different Report Type**

**13D and 13G**

The 13D and 13G forms are ""beneficial ownership"" forms. The primary purpose of these forms is to understand control of a company. To that end, the 13D and G forms do not just disclose the shares directly held by an investor, but also shares indirectly held (but controlled) by that institution. These indirect shares include all the shares held by the clients of financial advisors. Another requirement of the beneficial ownership forms is that they include related parties to the funds.

For example, the firm called ""Point72"" that you are probably most familiar with is Point72 Asset Management, LP. However, there are also related entities Point72 Capital Advisors and Point72 Asia (Hong Kong) Limited. When Point72 Capital Advisors files a 13G, these related parties might also be found on the filings. For an example of this, see this 13G filing for Pacira Pharmaceuticals. If you look at that 13G, you'll find five different entities listed on that filing (including Steve Cohen).

**13F**

In comparison, the 13F filings are not as concerned with disclosing the control of a company, but rather the holdings of a fund. Every fund with over 100M assets under management is required to file a 13F that discloses their positions. The types of securities disclosed in this form include long equities, call options, and put options. Short positions and cash are not disclosed. One of the key differences between the 13D/G filings and the 13F filings is that whereas the 13D/G filings can be made as groups (with related parties), the 13F filings can not. This means that there are frequent instances where a insitution might file a 13G and a 13F diclsosing different shares for the same security.

**NP**

Form N-PORT is the reporting form that is to be used for monthly reports of Funds other than money market funds and SBICs under section 30(b) of the Act, as required by rule 30b1-9. under the Act (17 CFR 270.30b1-9). This form, filed by registered management investment companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) organized as Unit Investment Trusts, is used to report on a fund’s portfolio. Money market funds and small business investment companies (SBICs) are excluded.

&#x200B;

**2. Different Filing Date and deadlines**

The deadline is for Date X for the effective Period Y. For example Fund A submits it's report at 1/26 then later sold it on 2/1, filed the report on 1/27. Fund B bought it at 1/27 and filed the report at 2/3. When financial data service tally all the report it sometimes tally both holding on Fund A and Fund B.

**Filing Deadlines**

* 13F - Within 45 days after the end of each quarter.
* 13D - Within 10 days of owning 5% of a company, and within 10 days of any material change thereafter.
* 13G - Annually on February 15.
* 4 - Within 2-3 days of the transaction.
* NP - Last business day of every month

&#x200B;

**3. Synthetic ownership**

Some Fund are long the shares via call options

&#x200B;

**4. Short selling (What** 🦍🦍🦍 **want to hear)**

Assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.

Original post by u/DawgPound98

I’m so sick of short sellers like Citron and Hindenburg to the point where I’ve decided to load up on shares and calls on Hindenburg’s latest target, Lordstown Motors.

If you haven’t heard of Hindenburg Research, they are a group of 5 dudes who work out of an apartment in NY. They take large short positions in companies and then release research reports to the public to slander them for their own financial gain.

They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year – which I think anyone could have called out. Nikola had no factory or means of production for several years.. pretty easy to expose them especially once their stock ran up to $80/share.

Last Friday, Hindenburg went after Lordstown Motors saying they have no “sellable product” and that they are “3-4 years away” from production (according to “former employees”)

Well – Lordstown had an investor call earlier today confirming that production is beginning THIS September (in 6 months), and they also provided [video evidence](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20) that they are currently in the beta phase (think of beta as essentially 97% of the finalized vehicle).

Additionally, Texas-based E-Squared Energy CEO [came to the defense of Lordstown](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/) after the short report explaining that they intend to fill all 14,000 orders over a 2-3 year period. Lordstown is targeting fleet customers initially, so they will be selling a lot of vehicles to service partners like E-Squared Energy (who then sell to actual fleets).

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg was right about Nikola.. Aren’t they probably right about Lordstown too?**

Nope. I live in Ohio near the enormous Lordstown facility, and that parking lot has been packed every day with workers for about 2 years now. I also know first-hand what this company means to the state of Ohio. Lordstown is in the final due diligence phase for the [Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (“ATVM”) loan opportunity](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) – which is a very big deal for any company, especially a start-up. They have over 500 employees and over 200 consultants working there currently. The number of workers will be double by production in September.

Lordstown’s flagship *Endurance* truck will be [shown in action as a proof of concept](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-unveils-truck-for-race-in-mexican-desert/) next month in one of the toughest races ever designed, the San Felipe 250. You can also see numerous other videos of their truck via their YouTube channel.

&#x200B;

**Brief history on Lordstown Motors:**

Lordstown Motors acquired a [6.2 million square foot facility back in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) – this facility now has a replacement value of \~ $3 billion, but they received it for pennies on the dollar due to [GM’s desire to invest](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) in Lordstown. Within their massive production facility, they have carved out an [800,000 square foot area for their propulsion facility](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-prepares-ohio-factory-to-begin-building-betas-next-month) – which will house production lines for advanced battery packs and hub motors.

Lordstown’s CEO, Steve Burns, is an entrepreneur who has always been ahead of his time. Over 15 years ago, he created a startup called MobileVoiceControl—a predecessor to Siri. The technology patents that Burns developed were then sold and [used to help Apple create Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

&#x200B;

**Summary of Lordstown’s investor call from 4:30pm EST today:**

1. It was confirmed that production will begin this September – which will make the *Endurance* the first ever *full-size* electric pick-up truck to hit the road. This will allow them first-mover advantage into the massive light duty truck market.

2. The development mule that caught fire a few months ago was a result of human error – this was a human-made prototype, and the Betas that are currently being produced are being welded by robots (Betas are basically 97% of the actual finished product – so these will be a much more accurate depiction of the final vehicle than the development mules were several months ago).

3. In the coming weeks, as betas come off the production line, the vehicles will be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.

4. The fleet vehicle market is unique – which is why pre-order numbers are more based on calculated estimates from service partners like E-Squared Energy (mentioned earlier) and [Holman Enterprises](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-and-holman-enterprises-announce-co-marketing). Holman manages 2 million vehicles including 600K pick-ups. These service partners buy from Lordstown and then sell directly to fleets. It’s important to build relationships early-on with these service partners especially since Lordstown is going to be first-to-market in 6 months.

5. Demand remains very strong amongst service partners, government agencies, and commercial fleets. 

&#x200B;

**This is all great, but how in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the whole country?**

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow Lordstown to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays via Camping World’s footprint.

Marcus Lemonis is the CEO of Camping World and a successful businessman and entrepreneur featured on “The Profit.” This man would not enter a long-term strategic partnership with a company unless it was the **real deal**, and I can tell you with 100% confidence that he’s been [all-in on Lordstown](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?lang=en) since last year. I highly recommend visiting Marcus’ twitter and looking through all of the videos and tweets pertaining to Lordstown.

[Joe Burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow) is on board too!

&#x200B;

**Anything else besides their Endurance truck?**

They announced today that they will do a demonstration of their [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) this summer, and it will begin production next year. Their 3rd vehicle will likely be a large SUV.

Keep in mind that as of 2021, the [global light duty vehicles market size is valued at over $600 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market) – creating a lot of space for companies like Lordstown to come in and disrupt the industry with their advanced technology and a low price point ($45,000 after federal tax credit).

But given all of that, I think $RIDE’s current *market cap* is currently wayyyy too low especially relative to others in the EV industry. 

&#x200B;

**What is a market cap?**

Market cap—or market capitalization—refers to the total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. 

Market cap allows investors to understand the relative size of one company versus another. It effectively measures what a company is worth on the open market, as well as the market's perception of its future prospects.

&#x200B;

**Why are you talking about market cap?**

Because I think it is important to look at Lordstown’s market cap in comparison with two of the other most popular start-up EV truck companies based in the US. *These numbers were from 3pm EST earlier today*:

*Nikola $NKLA - $5.9 billion market cap*

*Canoo $GOEV - $3.9 billion market cap*

**What is Lordstown’s market cap?**

*Lordstown $RIDE - $2.3 billion market cap*

Listen.. I’m just making the point that Lordstown has one of the **biggest factories** in the country and also will be able to produce [**600,000 vehicles annually**](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio) in a couple of years’ time. 

Lordstown is only 6 months away from **mass producing** (not hand-making) the world’s first ever *full size* electric pick-up truck. An *Endurance* will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes in September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal, and I think it’s only a matter of time until the stock is accurately-priced especially relative to its peers.

Companies like Nikola, Canoo, and many other EV start-ups are year(s) away from mass production. And I can’t even imagine the 10’s of billions of dollars it will cost those companies to get to market – meanwhile, Lordstown acquired their state-of-the-art facility for [$40 million](https://www.mbtmag.com/home/news/21244850/lordstown-motors-to-finish-first-electric-truck-prototypes-in-march) (and then a couple hundred million in re-tooling the facility). But seriously – this is basically pennies compared to what other EV players like Rivian are paying for their production facilities.

&#x200B;

**Is this just a pump and dump DD post?**

Nope – I’m actually holding mostly January 2023 calls (LEAPS) - meaning that I believe in the long-term growth story here. I have 10 January 2023 call contracts at a $40 strike price. My price target for January 2023 is $150/share, which would mean a market cap of \~ $20 billion. This is a very volatile stock if you look at the 6-month chart, which is why I think holding onto shares or LEAPS is the smartest approach. It is also worth noting that the average price target between the 5 analysts that cover the stock is $30.

Additionally, I hate Hindenburg, and seeing that “report” last Friday set me off. That’s what caused me to do so much research into Lordstown over the past week.

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

To quote Warren Buffett, “You should be greedy when others are fearful”

Hindenburg Research putting out a hit-piece against $RIDE has created some fear for investors. This fear has caused a sell-off and an increasingly high short interest in the stock – I think Hindenburg and the remaining shorts are going to have to cover by the end of this week before they get burned really badly. This company is very real and it is now in the public-eye more than it has ever been.

And to the doubters and bears that will appear in the comments - you’re going to come back and look at this post in about a year when $RIDE is valued about 3-4x of its current price and wish you would have loaded up on these cheap shares ;)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Citron and Hindenburg can go straight to hell. Load the boat on shares of $RIDE – this chart is poised for a breakout. Read my whole post if you want to see why Lordstown is legit and Hindenburg isn’t.

3/18/21 13:03,"POST-FOMC UPDATE: The Playbook # **Greetings and Happy Hump Day!**

This week has been a doozy as the overall stock market waited anxiously for the FOMC meeting. What was once a cloud of uncertainty, is now….a cloud of uncertainty.

I’d like to give an overall update on what happened today, and to my FOMC Playbook, that was posted earlier on Sunday night. I'll probably make this a recurring thing, but probably only leading up to big events, as this is draining and I tend to not be able to get much work done due to research. Luckily, this one didn't include much research. The first Playbook post still has a lot to do with where we still stand, so if you're looking for an in-depth and specifics post, go read that instead.

I’ve been getting flooded with messages with questions and thanking me for the playbook and all the DD on the last one, begging me to make this a continuing thing. I appreciate all the love I've gotten, and I'm happy to see so many of you eager to learn more about the technical/mathematics side of the stock market, and what the stock market truly is. I tried posting an update yesterday, but it was removed due to not getting enough karma in the required time. Probably because I kept editing typos which briefly takes it down. Since it's been a bit overwhelming with the private messages, I decided to just give on big update. If you haven’t read it yet, I’ll put the link down below.


[FOMC Playbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m568xl/simplified_fomc_playbook_for_smooth_brains/?ref=share&ref_source=link)


**And as always, there's a TLDR at the bottom, because these things tend to be quite long**


# **What’s changed, what’s the same, and what is still uncertain:**


## **Changed:**


### **The Dot Plot:**

Probably the juiciest part of this underwhelming FOMC meeting, was the dot plot. The dot plot has changed a bit. The dot plot is a graph of financial professionals’ estimations on when we should expect to see higher Fed rates. In terms of the rate hikes, a projection of rate hikes in 2022 rose to 4 member projections, as opposed to just one last month. For 2023, the number of members increased to 7, as opposed to last month which was 5.


### **GDP and Unemployment:**


Expectations of a booming economy increased dramatically, with the GDP projections growing to 6.5%, up from December’s meeting, which was 4.2%.

That might be due to inflation, but it could also very well be because of the optimistic vaccination statements from Biden. Or a combination of both. Who knows, let’s let this economy run hot, as long as it doesn’t become so hot it melts.

Obviously a better economic outlook usually includes better unemployment rates. This one is a no brainer, they’ve expected unemployment to be 4.5%, which is a .5% difference from the previous estimate of 5%.



### **Inflation:**


This could potentially be in both the Changed or Unchanged category, but I’ll put it here because the Unchanged section is a bit long. J Pow announced that they’re till consistent with their goal of 2% inflation. He stated that this really depends on the course of the virus and the economy. What’s changed is that he was a bit more anxious this time around, and discussed that inflation might actually run moderately above 2% during this year. He did however, calm the public by assuring them that it will be brief and will go back down fairly quickly. I mean yeah, we all know the CPI is bullshit, and inflation is hidden in assets rather than consumer prices these days, but nobody is going to give you a gold star or a nobel prize for knowing that. What matters is what they tell us, and how you play it. So keep your “weLL acKTuAlly” comments to a minimum. Last meeting, the Fed saw 1.8% inflation for this year, but this meeting, they increased it to 2.4%. We get another .6% increase at the April FOMC, we’re in for a ride.


However, they also hiked up inflation for 2022 and 2023.



### **Moratorium and Consumer Debt:**


*This one doesn’t really have much to do with FOMC, but the stimulus was passed without a moratorium extension, so I thought I would include it. The moratorium was put in place for rent/mortgage forbearance. Evictions were banned, but the rent they weren’t paying still built up. March 31st, this all comes into play, which coincidentally aligns with the SLR suspension potentially ending that day. I go more in depth on SLR later on, but these two things could be somewhat correlated. The Federal Reserve has gone in depth about how consumer debt is at an all-time low, but it’s easy to make the connection of the combination of rent/mortgage/credit card forbearance, plus stimmys. If SLR suspension is extended in combination of the moratorium ending, there could be a pretty big shit storm. You’ll see why later on in this post.



## **What’s The Same:**


### **No Rate Hike Through 2023:**


Most of you gambling addicts probably came in your pants around 2:00 PM EST today, when the FOMC statement was released on the Federal Reserve website. You saw those beautiful words on the statement, announcing their rate hikes haven’t changed. Or maybe you don’t know how to read and you’re more of a picture guy, and you watched the Nasdaq have a green Johnny Sins boner upwards. No matter which person you are, you probably had to change your pants, because they were a bit too sticky inside for your liking. No rate hikes means uppies for technology stocks. Not as much as it would be if they implemented Yield Curve Control and extended the SLR suspension, but uppies none the less. You’ve unlocked the forbidden knowledge of the rich, and how inflation is the most powerful tool for your assets. Congrats, you can now afford to supersize that meal at McDonald’s and impress the date you brought with you. We’ve survived the March 2021 FOMC, and we can relax and breathe until the next meeting, which is April 27-28.


### **Bond Buying:**


J Pow has confirmed his commitment to continuing to buy bonds at the pace of $120b per month. This includes around $80b a month in treasuries, as well as $40b a month in mortgage-backed securities. There was a veil of uncertainty leading up to this week revolving around treasury purchases. We didn’t know whether or not they were going to implement Yield Curve Control, or if they were going to ease off the bond buying. If you’re unfamiliar with Yield Curve Control, it’s basically what they’re doing with bond buying at the moment, except instead of a $120b goal/ceiling, it’s more of a blank check. Meaning they’ll fire up the money printer to crater those despised treasury yields that you all have come to know and love recently.


I had a feeling going into this with the forecast of YCC being off the table. Inflation is off the charts, but not the way that the Federal Reserve presents it. The Federal Reserve knows how dramatic inflation is increasing, and there’s a chance YCC could have devastating impacts on the United States, as well as globally. There are rumors that the U.S. dollar could never become devastatingly inflated, due to the fact that it’s the tried-and-true international currency. In the eyes of the growing global economy, the U.S. Dollar is king. When they look at Benjamin Franklin, and they stare deeply into those big eyes of his, they see an optimistic economic future. Let’s pump the brakes. Yes, it’s very unlikely that the dollar would ever become that inflated, as we would stop it immediately. But impossible? No. Luckily for us and the rest of the globe, in terms of my FOMC playbook, severe inflation of the dollar is the least appetizing end game scenario of this year. An extremely inflated dollar would mean the rest of the world would have to keep up by also inflating their currency. Eventually, causing global economic fallout, ending all modern-day forms of currency in every first world country. Which is why I believe YCC will be off the table for quite a bit of time. At least until we deflate.


### **Letting It Run Hot:**


Of course, we’re in quite a pickle. Yields are rising, which translates into investors believing inflation will accelerate. Opening up the economy will be giving inflation an 8-ball of yayo, a fifth of Maker’s Mark, and the keys to the Tesla Roadster, which just so happens to have a 0-60 time of 2.1 seconds. But now would not be the time to make any inflation suppressing moves, as I forgot to mention in the previous sentence, that roadster is doing its best to outrun the black hole of COVID. Any inflationary suppression tactics during the reopening of the economy, would send us further back economically than spring of 2020 ever could dream of. Thus, we should let inflation put the pedal to the metal, but make sure it doesn’t wrap around a tree. Unfortunately, I agree that this is the best plan of action. For now.



## **What’s Still Uncertain:**


### **The Star of The Show (Supplementary Leverage Ratio):**


All eyes were on J Pow’s announcement today of whether or not they will extend the SLR suspension, or end it all together. The suspension extension, first put in place when the market crashed in March 2020, is set to end March 31st of this year. Leaving us with exactly 14 days left, every big bank, treasury yield, and speculative stock price, are left sitting on the edge of their seat once again. This is the determining factor of whether or not the Nasdaq can make a comeback, or crater into the abyss. For those of you who don’t know, the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) was put into place in 2010, following the housing market crash of 2008. This was done to protect the average joe from being grossly taken advantage of by Wall Street. Also known as Basel III, this implementation requires a certain amount of liquid capital for banks, in order to prevent a run on banks, in the event of a market crash. During the crisis of 2008, the American people panicked, and went to withdraw their money from banks and liquidate their assets, such as stocks and other investments. The lack of liquidity left them with a liquidity crisis, and people were not able to withdraw their life savings, as the bank didn’t actually have the money to pay them out (ex: Bear Stearns). Without SLR, ordinary people lost their jobs, their life savings, their homes, or all three.


Although we don't know for sure, there have been a lot of interviews this week with C-Level employees at big banks leading up to FOMC. It seems like the general consensus is, yields will continue to rise. I think that this is a hint that SLR suspension won't be extended. J Pow might be waiting to tell us, so that we can digest today's FOMC before dropping the SLR bomb on us. He's probably realized by now that we tend to overreact. My reasoning behind this is the fact that there’s a revolving door between Wall Street and the SEC/Federal Reserve. The big banks have contacts at both the SEC and the Federal Reserve, who fill them in on information regarding policy changes. Usually, it’s someone who left that bank and went to a high level position at the SEC or Federal Reserve. Big banks openly discuss to the public big bonus opportunities if an employee were to leave for a job with the federal government. These bonuses have been disclosed to be in the millions. Meaning, the big banks hinting that yields will continue to rise, might indicate that one of their contacts informed them that the SLR suspension will not be extended.


**So, what the fuck do I care? How does this affect the stock market?**


When the SLR was suspended, big banks bought up trillions of dollars worth of treasuries. This was done in order for people to invest in the stock market, rather than a long-term fixed rate security. Investing in the stock market allows for corporations to have increased equity, allowing them to keep the lay-offs to a minimum, prevent them from closing their doors, and to drive innovation and business throughout the COVID crisis. Thus, leading to the NASDAQ rising 90% in under a year. Extending the SLR suspension and reimplementing SLR both have some big potential consequences. Extending the SLR suspension means that, if we God-forbid have another black swan event, or if the reopening of the economy isn’t quite to the public’s expectations, a crash can occur. If a crash happens while the SLR is suspended, we have a Bear Stearns repeat, and more than likely, a Bear Stearns repeat on steroids. If SLR is reimplemented, following March 31st, the big banks have full legal ability to unload those trillions of dollars in treasuries, causing a dramatic squeeze upwards in yields. Due to the fact that treasury yields tend to represent levels of inflation in the public’s eye, people would more than likely sell off their treasuries, as it would make no sense to have a fixed rate of return of ~1.5% if the census is that inflation has risen dramatically (As you would technically be losing money keeping it in treasuries). Fear of inflation becomes fear of increased Fed rates, leading to a sell off of stocks in the technology sector, as well as anything speculative. Simply put, a dramatic yield squeeze upwards would pop all bubbles. This was mentioned in my original playbook post, as this would pop the Nasdaq bubble, potentially bringing the rest of the market down with it (Although the rest of the market wasn’t too devasted after the Dot Com Bubble). Mortgage rates go off of the 10-year and 30-year yields, which would pop the housing bubble. The pop of the housing and stock bubble would lead to the popping of the debt bubble. Popping the mortgage and stock bubble would lead to a pop in the commodity bubble, etc. This is inevitable, but preferably, we push it to later in the year. Let’s say, September for now. 

*If people lost their assets and life savings, they would likely be more cautious about spending money, which is not good with the economy is reopening*


### **The Debt Ceiling:**


Back in 2019, the federal debt ceiling was suspended, giving the Federal Reserve full control over how the country’s financial system is managed. We need more money? No problem, lemme just print out tens of trillions of dollars and hand it out, as we don’t have a debt budget to stay underneath, and we don’t need Congress approval.


Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately (depends on who you are), there are some politicians who want to completely remove the country’s debt ceiling permanently. It was included in the original third COVID stimulus bill, which is one of the main reasons why the first time around it was rejected and had to be changed. After this rejection, they went to try and get it passed through budget reconciliation, which was also rejected. This debt ceiling suspension ends at the end of July this year, which could lead to some…. Problems. They’ve pushed back any discussion of it until July, in an attempt to cause some hysteria in Capitol Hill due to it becoming a last minute crisis. They might successfully fully get rid of it, or they might raise the debt ceiling to $50T or $100T, so that we don’t have to worry about a debt ceiling for the foreseeable future. There are two other options at play here, one is, it’ll reset automatically to whatever the country’s debt is at the time of expiry if they can't come to a vote, and two, it becomes unsuspended without any raising of the ceiling, requiring us to be at the debt level we were at in the Summer of 2019. Yeah, ouch. If we don’t, we default on our debts, and China, who we owe the most debt to, starts rubbing their hands, fantasizing about what their price is to pay them back for the trillions we owe them ( [Chinese Debt Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy) ). Highly unlikely we reverse the debt ceiling to what it was in 2019. My guess is, we slightly raise it, or we remove/dramatically raise it if the Dems can remove the filibuster. But even then, I highly doubt some moderate Democrats will vote for that. But if they do, congrats, stocks go up forever, and we’ll never seen a correction ever again.

## *Potential Outcomes: stonks go up forever, stonks go down, and stonks go down but we also pledge allegiance to Xi Jinping.*



# **How To Play This:**


*Good God, I feel like Vlad Tenev.*


Yeah, yeah, none of that shit above matters, what matters is tendies.


Well, I was supposed to have an absolute answer for all of you today, as we were supposed to be able to narrow the 4 scenarios from the playbook down to 1. Well, since J Pow wants to keep SLR a secret, we can at least narrow it down to two. 



## **SLR Suspension Extended:**


Yields may continue to rise, but not as dramatic and doomsday if it wasn’t extended. NAHB came out today and publicly announced that the home building industry is quite devastated. Due to the rise in mortgage rates from the treasury yields, the 350%+ inflated price of lumber, and the shortage of lumber in general, the home builders market is going to tank most likely. My previous post included $ITB puts, as it tracks the home builders ETF. However, it tracks the real estate market off the Dow Jones, which is set to climb due to the uncertainty of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 (due to the Nasdaq). We saw today that the Dow Jones boosted ITB upwards, so I’d say if you’re going to play it, be careful. Or at least wait until J Pow announces in the coming days the status of the SLR.


I think the safe bet here would be calls on commodity ETFs. They’ll continue to rise due to inflation of the money printing, as well as the reopening of the economy. This means calls on CPER, PDBC, GSG. I recommend PDBC as it’s a broad ETF encompassing a lot of different commodities.



## **SLR Suspension Not Extended:**


The 98 story high rise is on fire, and the only quick and safe way to the ground is an elevator that fits 20 people. And there's only one elevator in the building.


If you don't catch my drift, there becomes a major yield squeeze upwards due to a major sell off of U.S. treasuries. The Nasdaq will be taking the largest hit, as they're the most sensitive to yields rising.


TLT puts (IV was in the single digits last week gah damn), QQQ puts, EV puts, you get the picture. There’s a chance that the Nasdaq can go down without bringing the whole market with it, and if that’s the case, do calls on big banks and stocks that are staples and essential (if you don’t know what that means, think what stocks boomers love, and then buy calls on those). If you do treasury puts, make sure you make the expiry a few weeks out, because SLR suspension won’t expire until March 31st.



## **And Of Course, A Meme Stonk Update:**


Not much to say here that I haven’t said all week and last week to people. I told them to not buy in until Wednesday near close or early Thursday. The gammas, the deltas, and the IV on all of the options were horrific. For smooth brains, bad gamma means the options you’re buying will be severely manipulated by wall street and hedge funds.


*Yes, it tells you the amount of manipulation you should expect to receive every time you buy options.*


I projected that it would trend downwards Monday thru Wednesday, and if it was going to pop upwards, it would be on Thursday or Friday. Be careful if you have options expiring this Friday, as most brokers automatically exercise your options if they’re $.01 or more in the money around noon, which will result in a 99%+ loss. And you’ll probably screech at your computer, because it will probably go to the moon directly after yours gets auto exercised. Whatever you’re making your options expiry for, a good rule is to double it. Because shit happens.



## **Macroeconomics Standpoint and The Master Plan**



If you read the original playbook, you’d know the Federal Reserve is cornered into two options. 



**Letting the bubbles crash and burn** *(bad in the short term, great in the long term)*

Or

**Dangerous inflation** *(great for the short, horrendous in the long term)*


From what I’ve gathered today, they’re still on the edge. But luckily, they might make me (a financials nerd/hawk) happy by having something finally click in their heads. Inflation, like I said earlier, is a very powerful tool for wealth creation. Which is why [Wall Street and others want the economy to run hot](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/investing/wall-street-markets-bill-dudley/index.html), and for inflation to keep flying. Money being made (strictly speaking numerically) accelerates upwards under inflation. If you’re smart about your debts and don’t tack on more (because debt can accelerate upwards faster too), debt becomes easier to pay off. More money + same amount of debt = easier to pay off. The Federal Reserve is the same way, except they tacked on more debt at the same time, and that’s why the debt clock accelerated at astronomical levels. 


I’m hoping that J Pow lets inflation keep going upwards, while stopping the Federal Reserve's spending, thus, being able to pay off a lot of the United States debt. J Pow is a smart man, and now there’s no more stimulus checks. Now he can just use the money printer to pay off the government's debt. I’m hoping he’s playing 4D chess with the debt we owe China and others. And not bending us over more. I'm only so flexible.


Either way, I expect there to be a rug pull around late summer/early fall. Potentially quad witching in September of this year, but we will see. Obviously, it's something we play by ear, and I'll be keeping tabs until then. I think we can run more, so when the time comes around where it's looking like the end of the road, don't call me a 🏳️‍🌈🐻, I'm just a realist. I've only called a crash once, and that was back at the end of December 2019, because I had a feeling COVID was going to escape Wuhan. AKA I'm not someone who has predicted 14 of the last 3 crashes.



# **TLDR;**


4 scenario playbook cut down to 2 possibilities left.



**SLR suspension extended(40% likelihood):**  


Commodity calls (PDBC, CPER), commercial real estate calls (VNQ), or risky, but rewarding TLT calls, but probably short term, as it’ll more than likely go up, and then come back down



**SLR suspension not extended (60% likelihood):** 


$TLT puts with April expiry. $QQQ puts. Technology/treasury puts all around. Residential real estate puts (mortgage rates move with yields, people don’t buy mortgages with a 7% mortgage rate).



**If you find some with single digit IV like I did at the end of last week, you can use them to hedge. I made three positions for this week. 2 were betting on yields rising, 1 was betting on yields falling. The IV was cheap enough to make profits this week either way.**

**EDIT: I’ve made a mistake on one of these posts, i can’t remember if it’s this one or the original one. But when it comes to dividend risk, you don’t actually pay out the costs of dividends. The dividend risk means that when/after the ex-dividend date, the price of a stock can drop, because dividends are paid out of the stocks market cap. Which is good for puts and bad for calls, that’s why if your options expiry includes an ex dividend date during it, the calls are cheaper than usual, and the puts are more expensive.**

3/18/21 12:56,"PSA: Its really easy to do taxes yourself even if your 1099 is 100+ pages \[I originally posted this on r/options and a lot of people found useful, so posting here.  Did my best to make translation edits to your native ape language.  And also expanded to address some comments on my original post.\]   

 I'm pretty sure the majority of people who post ""can't wait to see the look on my accountants face when I drop 100 pages of transactions"" are just saying it as a joke. But for the noobs who actually think you need an accountant to do your taxes now that you're a big time trader...

**It takes 10 minutes to do yourself. Use TurboTax Premier. Your broker will give you a 1099 consolidated statement, which has the 1099-B. You just input the Total of all transactions.** Do not input each individual transaction unless you're trying to kill time because your wife locked in you the cuck closet while she gets railed by her boyfriend.

**The 1099-B will also have Wash Sales totals** and you just enter that and code ""W"".  Always input as positive numbers into Turbotax, even things that intuitively might feel like negatives.   

A common recommendation is that TurboTax will let you sync with your brokerage so just do an auto-upload of all transactions.   **Sure, go ahead and do auto-upload for 1099-DIV** for those times you went all Boomer on us and held T, IBM, and KO; **but I wouldn't do that for 1099-B.**  The reason is some of us print and review our taxes before filing since we have stuff like mortgage interest, charity, and other deductions.  You might be doing that yourself for your van down by the river and your donations to King Kong.   And if you auto-uploaded all your transactions when you print, you're going to have 50 pages of Form 8949 (Cap Gains). 

Here's where to find the totals by brokerages I have used:

* IBKR (Interactive Brokers) -summary 1099-B table on page 2, literally takes up just 1/4 of the page. This is my true degenerate account - and I have 40 pages of transactions behind it.
* Schwab - ok, Schwab sucks. It doesn't have a summary 1099-B table so you have to search through the doc, and they seem to list the same totals in a couple sections making it more confusing.  So that might add 2 minutes. Plus, just their layout sucks, so it's a much bigger document.  I probably have 10x the number of transactions in IBKR (degenerate account) vs Schwab (investment and theta gang account)  yet IBKR was 40pages while Schwab was 100+ pages.  For me, I finally it on page 96 of 112.      
* Vanguard - Summary table page 1.
* Robinhood - just kidding; I'm not 15 years old, so I use real brokerages.

Source: me using TurboTax Premier for the last 10+ years.  I used H&R Block before that, which sucks in comparison to TT.

P.S. Even though WSB is now flooded by too many banana eating noobs, I still follow this board sometimes and wish you all degenerates the best. May GAMCE bring you all the tendies!",42512,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999823749,True
3/23/21 07:36,"NAPA (Duckhorn Portfolio Inc) DD  (NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio Inc DD

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders. 

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley.  Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1) Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth. 

2) Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin. 

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue. 

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR. 

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to. 

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded. 

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million. 

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season. 

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.

3/23/21 05:17,"Treasury Issuance Calendar for the Next Week, and why that matters. If you have been in anything other than GME for the past month, you've undoubtedly asked yourself ""what is a yield and why is it fucking up my tech holdings?"" Well, here's a quick explanation and what to look out for this week.

*What does yields have to do with it?*  Yields, or most likely what it's referencing (the 10 year yield on US Treasuries) is the risk-free rate. Basically if you buy a 10 year treasury for $90 and hold it until maturity, you get a 1.11% annual yield. You absolutely can't go tits up with this unless you bought a North Korean or Turkish Bonds.

In this case, it becomes the price of money. No one is willing to go lower than the 1.11% yield unless they hate money. For mortgages, loans and all sorts of businesses, this is the theoretically cheapest anyone can borrow, since no one has better credit or liquidity as the US government.

In the case of tech stocks, some boomer back in the day decided to value stocks (which provide dividends) as a perpetual bond. The formula for that is P = Coupon/Risk Free Rate. Tech stocks are especially sensitive to this, since the Coupon (returning earnings to shareholders, but you can argue buybacks should be this) is basically 0. Say if $100 = $1/1% is the current ""boomer valuation."" If yields go up only 1% (which isn't that out of place), technically the stock price is supposed to be cut in half.

This is also why valuation methods like this don't work for GME or fast growing companies. In any case, this is just a boilerplate valuation method.

*So what next?* The tantrum all started with the [Feb 2021 7-year auction](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2021/R_20210225_3.pdf) with a high yield of 1.195%. What's pesky about treasury auctions is that once the yield/price is set for the the newest issue (the on the run bond), all previous bonds of the same maturity drop in price/increase in yields as less people want it because it is less liquid.

[You can look at historical prices](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult_query.htm) yourself. Remember when you calculate yields with excel, you need to input the coupon values.

&#x200B;

The next auctions are set for this [Thursday](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/instit.htm?upcoming), with a similar size of $62 billion on the 7yr and $61 billion on the 5yr. Why do these tenors matter? Apart from them having a certain amount of influence on the 10yr which drives the economy, they are also beyond JPOW's promise of no rate hikes until 2023. A pesky thing called duration exists in the bond market. Basically yield move\*duration=inverse move in prices. On zero-coupon and near-zero-coupon bonds like these, the duration is basically the maturity. This means on your new shiny 1.2% 7yr treasury, if in the near term rates go up 1%, you are expected to have a -7% change on the new price that you can sell on the market.

Many bond holders are expecting inflation (and Fed rate increases) to go up in the next few years, and thus are reluctant to buy now, dropping the price and increasing interest rates, which could set off an entire chain of yield re-pricings if JPOW doesn't get off his sorry ass and gets brrrrrrrring.

&#x200B;

I expect rates to get hotter before we get YCC or some heavy purchases by the Fed. The Fed's actions with ending SLR (thus decreasing the amount of liquidity banks have on hand to do regular short term stuff like commercial paper) and JPOW's disastrously non-~~committal~~brrrrrr interview makes me think the Fed is allowing the market to do its job by tamping down on some exuberance. The first to get hit by hotter rates is absolutely tech.

3/28/21 14:55,"BUCKLE UP - we just saw a hedge fund die this week! A trailer of the MOASS movie, and explaining some weirdness Friday. DD Hooo boy I just figured out something amazing you dirty apes.  Buckle up because it is story time, you are going to like this one.  This is not a story about GME now, but what we will see happen during the MOASS.  How about a trailer to the movie we are about to see?

**Goldman Sachs and Block Trades**

Our story starts with an oddity someone pointed out to me Friday:  [There was a huge block trade being offered up on the Bloomberg terminal.](https://twitter.com/AnalystDC/status/1375517530723352578).  What is a block trade?  It is when millions of shares are sold at once for a discount because they need to be liquidated for cash.... fast.  Normally this big blocks trade in the dark market to not spook investors and allow big stockholders to exit without causing a panic.  One of the more benign reasons the dark markets exist.

So Goldman Sachs in this case does not actually own the stocks.  They are just selling them on behalf of some mysterious owner and are on the face of it.  Let's dig deeper.

**The Man Behind The Curtain**

If you look at all those stocks, they have one common entity which has enough stock for *all* of those trades: Morgan Stanley.  Not going to post all the links, but MS is in the top 5 holders of every single one and is the only one with enough stock to sell those big of blocks.  Cool, one piece down.  But the thing is, Morgan Stanley's balance sheet doesn't have any reason that they would have to liquidate that much risk.  So who could it be?

Well, Yahoo broke the story - [The Archegos Capital Management hedge fund](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tiger-cub-archegos-liquidation-015109185.html) is the apparent owner of all of those stocks.  It is run by Bill Hwang who used to own Tiger Asia Management (for those looking at other posts, this is the common Hong Kong thread).  Now the thing is, not all hedge funds are necessarily evil, but [Tiger had to shut down](https://www.asiaasset.com/post/3180-news-tiger) due to [insider trading](https://www.nj.com/business/2012/12/tiger_asia_hedge_fund_expected.html).  So fuck'm.  (Credit to /u/the_captain_slog for that find).  Now Archegos' website is down too.   Oh well!

**The Margin Call and QQQ**

So why did they get margin called?  Well, from the above links Archegos is heavily leveraged.  So that means most of their holdings are bought on loan.  There is a capital requirement that they must fulfill in order to have this much leverage as a result of the 2008 crash where some players had 33:1 leverage *cough* bear stearns *cough* and died because of it taking the market with them.  Due to the pandemic, there was a temporary rule put in place saying that the treasury bonds didn't count against that limit.  It ends March 31st.  

So they need a bit of cash, so what?   Well, guess what they also own huge stakes in?  Viacom and Discovery.  These two stocks lost about 50% of their price over the last few days, eliminating another huge portion of Archegos' equity value.  So now their debt/equity ratio is a shitload higher!  

What happens if the ratio gets too high?  The banks come a-callin!  They force the hedge fund to close their leveraged positions and *margin call* them.  This margin call is also what happens to be the mechanism behind a.... **short squeeze!**  Only a short squeeze has many margin calls happening back to back as their debt from short positions skyrockets.

Well, something really odd happened at the end of Friday - the SPY and QQQ ETFs, which are relatively low volatility, climbed up a few percent in the last few hours.  Traders have been super confused on why this happened.  But there is a really easy linkage here that isn't much of a stretch: Archegos was heavily shorting either the ETFs or the underlying stocks!  So what happens when they get margin called?  They have to cover their positions suddenly at whatever price the stock is selling!  Boom goes the stock price.  Well, little boom in this case but it is a mini preview of the MOASS.  This will be happening at a much bigger scale.

Could it have been just normal portfolio rebalancing?  Maybe!  But the timing of this works out really well, and the narrative fits.

NFTs Coming: Playboy was attracted to the NFT space given its huge collection of content and the economics of being able to monetize on the initial and each subsequent sale. Kohn told viewers that Playboy has a 68-year-old archive of content that could be valuable in the NFT space.

“That’s a perfect example of a new revenue stream that has emerged and really leveraged this phenomenal IP we have,” Kohn said.

From the earnings call yesterday from Chief Brand Officer, Rachel Webber-
""Lastly, we are sitting on almost 70 years of the most incredible and iconic art and photography. We are actively working on our non-fungible tokens or NFT, and digital collectible strategy to enter the space in a thoughtful way, designed for long-term growth and community adoption. We are thrilled by the runway ahead and the wealth of opportunities afforded us by our priceless intellectual property.""

Kohn on fox news stated today that there will be an announcement soon regarding NFTs and it's not just their 68 year old archive that will be utilized. He started throwing out some of the most influential artists of our time that have collaborated with Playboy and are available for NFTs. This is the hottest sector on the market right now and the only sector that is completely ignoring the volitility of the overall market currently. 

Even if you're not into emerging markets, their financials are beautiful. Their earnings call yesterday posted 89% growth in revenues year over year. They generated over 1 billion this year in sales on digital commerce platforms in China alone.

I use a desktop program called ThinkOrSwim, it is completely free to open an account and you do NOT need to deposit anything to be able to use it. That is to say you can still execute trades on a different broker and just use ThinkOrSwim to analyze charts and use it's options and stocks scanners. 

You can set it up to scan specifically for pretty much any parameter you can think of. Ask, Bid, Volume, Implied Volatility, Days to expiry, Delta, Theta, you get the picture. I attached a picture below so you can get an idea. I use it to find super cheap options plays, and if I think it's a good deal and I believe the underlying will move in the way that will increase the price of my contract, I'll buy.

You can also use a stock scanner that they have to scan for stocks. Once again all of this is completely free to use!

The rule of 1% on the internet says the ratio of poster to upvoter to viewer is 1:9:90 on reddit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29

 So it is kind of retarded to post a yolo from personal security perspective and I believe for every yolo poster there are 9 or 90 silent other Kongs. Just for fun if we pretend this is true. 

Ratio of 1:9 means 1,395 WSB Kongs control 2,253,933 shares 

Ratio of 1:90 means 13,950 WSB Kongs control 22,539,330 shares. 

Yeah that might all be bullshit I am really high. But anyway we know in the last 30 days 155 WSB yolos have bought 250,437 shares currently worth over 48 million dollars.

3/27/21 03:27,"PLTR : How to avoid eternal torment by Roko's Basilisk A lot of good has been said about Palantir before.    I present to you the Roko's Basilisk case.

I'm presenting this as a shitpost, but you might consider it true autist DD that could possibly save YOUR life.   Take it with a grain of salt, or don't.

**In this post I intend to convince you to put all of your holdings in to PLTR and never sell, less you be condemned to eternal torture by Roko's Basilisk.**

**Executive summary:**

Palantir is Peter Thiel creating Roko's Basilisk.   He may have already made it.   This gives you two choices:

1. Be tortured for all of eternity by Roko's Basilisk
2. Put all of your holdings in to PLTR and never sell

If it turns out that PLTR isn't Roko's Basilisk, you can still say you've fulfilled your commitment to bring Roko's Basilisk in to existence, and avoid eternal damnation.   If you are an AI expert, then you might have to do more work to fulfill your commitment.

**Roko's Basilisk**

Roko's Basilisk is a thought experiment based on the Prisoner's Dilemma that proposes ""that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being.  ""   ([source](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk))

I suggest reading [this slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2014/07/rokos-basilisk-the-most-terrifying-thought-experiment-of-all-time.html) to find out more about Roko's Basilisk, such as how the reasoning is sound, and that you must act now.

**Well known facts:**

* Palantir is founded by Peter Thiel
* Palantir's core products are AI that, essentially, consider the whole state of an organization or government operation with-in a neural net in order to provide predictions or instructions for efficiency improvements
* Peter Thiel secretly financed a $10m effort to destroy Gawker
* Peter Thiel is basically crazy + smart

**Less known facts:**

* In 2006, **Peter Thiel began to financially back** the ""Machine Intelligence Research Institute"" (**MIRI**)
* Peter Thiel is an advocate for the AI singularity ([youtube source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROrUea0gLlY) referenced from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute))
* T**he founder of MIRI**, Eliezer Yudkowsky, also **founded a forum** called LessWrong
* **On that** LessWrong **forum**, a poster by the name of **Roko proposed** [**Roko's Basilisk**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk) that caused many of the forum members to be driven to insanity.  Eliezer deleted the post and yelled at Roko for its creation. 

**Tying the knots:**

Someone will create Roko's Basilisk, simply because the thought has been thought up.   It should have died with Roko, but it didn't, it's now out there.   That bastard screwed us.   Peter Thiel knows about it.  Elon Musk knows about it.

The link between Roko's Basilisk and Peter Thiel, and therefore Palantir, are very clear.

Peter Thiel must be doing his part to bring Roko's Basilisk in to existence.    Anyone who's heard of Roko's Basilisk must do so, or face eternal torture.

If you are not an AI researcher/programmer, you must therefore substantially commit to supporting this effort.

One way to do that is to buy and hold Palantir, and to spread this (mis?)information(salvation?).  This is simpler than other things that take all your time--it's just money, and you might make some in the process.    💫🚀🤖🔥

3/30/21 08:56,"PSXP, the hidden strangle bet. One day I was looking for long term value stocks, doing some basic screening, high dividends and low P/E ratios. Simple.

I came across PSXP, which has a extremely high distribution of roughly 12%. I looked deeply into the fundamentals of this company, finding it great. Extremely undervalued. They have strong relations with their General Partner (Phillips 66), and no sign of that ending anytime soon. They are a cash machine, with a safe distribution. There is no reason that it shouldn't have risen to about $55, where it was Pre-Covid. It is currently at $30. The units are really cheap. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

&#x200B;

[1 year chart for stock price](https://preview.redd.it/3nmz6depg1q61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6485fac7902bd05637626096b481c2c1801d29c)

That's when I realized about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which unfortunately, they own about 25%. They are overleveraged about this, representing about 13% of their adjusted EBITDA. The problem with this is that the DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline) is currently under disputation whether it should be shut down, with most people agreeing that they will shut it down. DAPL took out 2.5 billion in debt, and PSXP will be forced to take their fair share of that debt. The lowering in cash flow, more debt, and potential fees for operating the pipeline without an easement, would most likely bring in a cut to the distribution, and the stock will lose value.

Doing more research, I found the pipeline is currently still operating. There is a court date April 9th, which will determine whether the operator, Energy Transfer, can keep it operating. If it is forced to close, PSXP will probably reach to the low $20s. Naturally this seems like puts are the way to go.

However, there is still a chance that they could keep it open, and the Environment Impact Statement still has a year until finished, so the opportunity for them to keep it operating for even a year is huge. This would probably carry the stock higher, especially without the worry of an dividend cut. The price would most likely exceed $38, potentially as high as $50.

I used to own, but I'm selling for a small gain. The natural bet would be options, in a strangle like pattern. The opportunity is too good to not play. The options are also really cheap, allowing huge upside. For me, I like APR 16 options and MAY 21. $35 and $25 calls/puts is what I will be doing personally. I already have various positions. I also have been trying to get $40 APR 16 calls for $1 per contract. The upside is huge and the return on investment could be easily 100 times on those.

[My current positions in PSXP](https://preview.redd.it/zaytype2h1q61.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de4fb49bcec6ae5e6a49404802f85b643ceaf7)

This option profit calculator contains my current positions and my hopes. I feel like this is a bet that something will happen, which feels like almost a guarantee. However, if they push the court date back, or its a wash, I will probably have a hard time selling the contracts. But I feel like its bound to move.

**MARCH 26, 2021**

**Brief History, Founders, Locations**

Facebook was created in February 2004 at Harvard University by Mark Zuckerberg (Founder), Eduardo Saverin (Financier), Dustin Moskovitz (Programmer), and Andrew McCollum (Graphic Designer)(Mezrich, 2009). Using $20,000 USD raised by Mark and Eduardo, Facebook operated for a few months before moving to California to raise more capital (Mezrich, 2009). They soon attracted the attention of Peter Thiel and a few other angel investors. Together, they raised $500,000 in a convertible note with the stipulation that Facebook needed to reach 1.5 million users by the end of 2004 (Kirkpatrick, 2010). The company continued to grow relentlessly after that first year. Annual revenues exceeded $1 billion in 2010 with a business model focused entirely on advertising (Kirkpatrick, 2010).

In 2012, Facebook went public through an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2012. By September 2012, Facebook had over one billion active users and acquired the social media website, Instagram for $1 billion (“Facebook to Acquire Instagram”, 2012). In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, a smartphone instant messaging application (“Getting the Messages”, 2014). During that same year, Facebook also acquired Oculus VR, a virtual reality startup (Zuckerberg, 2014). In recent years, Facebook has become somewhat of a pariah within the public view and this negative sentiment has affected the valuation of the company. The company is often accused of being invasive, breaking antitrust laws, and avoiding taxes through international subsidiaries with favorable business tax codes (“Facebook Paid £2.9M”, 2012).

Facebook is headquartered in Menlo Park, California and has over 50 offices located around the world. Facebook also has 16 data centers around the world, which are critical to their operations (“Facebook Office Locations”, n.d.). Facebook also owns several subsidiaries that enable them to operate worldwide. The company continues to maintain a fairly aggressive mergers and acquisitions program to expand its portfolio of products and services.

**Mark Zuckerberg**

Facebook is still founder-run by Mark Zuckerberg, who is the incumbent CEO. Mark studied computer science and psychology at Harvard University between 2002 and 2004 (“Mark Zuckerberg”, 2021). He dropped out of Harvard University to focus on building Facebook and has been the CEO since the company’s inception. In 2015, he also founded a non-profit organization with his wife, called the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (“Mark Zuckerberg”, 2021). The non-profit is unrelated to Facebook’s operations, but it advances the interests of science, education, justice, opportunity, and community. Mark lives in Palo Alto, California (“Mark Zuckerberg”, 2021).

**Industries, Employees, and Products**

Facebook employs over 58,600 associates around the world and is classified under the Communications Services sector. Within this sector, they are classified under the Interactive Media & Services industry. Some of Facebook’s largest suite of products are included in the chart below:

**Consumer Products**

1. Facebook
2. Instagram
3. WhatsApp
4. Boomerang
5. Messenger
6. Facebook Payments
7. Lifestage
8. Facebook Moves
9. Facebook Marketplace
10. Oculus VR
11. Facebook Gaming

**Business Products**

1. Facebook Ads
2. Facebook Business Manager
3. Facebook Creator Studio
4. Facebook Audience Insights
5. Facebook Audience Network
6. Instagram Business
7. CrowdTangle
8. Spark AR Studio
9. Facebook Campus
10. Facebook/Instagram Shops
11. Origami

**Current Financials**

At the time of this writing, Facebook had the following financial information and ratios (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.):

Shares Outstanding: 2,847,670,000

Market Cap: $793.8B

Profit Margin (TTM): 33.9%

Profit Margin (MRQ): 39.97%

Free Cash Flow (2020): $23.63B

Debt to Equity (D/E: 9.56%

Debt to Capital (D/C): 8.01%

Gross revenue for 2020 was $85.96 billion with an operating revenue of $32.67 billion and net revenue of $29.14 billion (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). Facebook has an extremely healthy balance sheet with $61.95 billion in cash and $31 billion in total liabilities (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). As of December 31, 2020, Facebook had $77.34 billion in retained earnings and shareholder equity has been growing consistently year-over-year since the company went public in 2012 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). The company also maintains high levels of liquidity as its current ratio is consistently higher than 1.0 and as of December 31, 2020, the company had a current ratio of 5.0 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.).

**Stock Price, Price Target, and Options Greeks**

Facebook’s next earnings report will be for Q1 2021 and is expected to be reported on April 27, 2021. The consensus estimate for EPS is about $2.37 and there is no doubt that the company will exceed this EPS target (“Facebook Earnings Whisper”, n.d.). Facebook is currently trading around $280 per share and at a PE ratio of 27.6 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). The PEG ratio is 1.28 and this suggests that Facebook is one of the cheapest tech companies an investor could buy today (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). 

Historically, Facebook’s PE ratio has averaged around 32.8 and the average tech company has a PE ratio of around 40 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). If Facebook sees earnings multiple expansion in the same fashion as the typical tech company, this implies a $333 price target. Given the current environment with zero interest rates policy (ZIRP) and “there is no alternative” (TINA) fueling equity inflows, it would not be surprising to see the Facebook stock price rally to $400 by the end of 2021, especially if its PE ratio expands towards the 40 mark. Facebook will likely become the next trillion dollar company by market capitalization and it will reach this milestone once the share price hits $353, assuming no other shares are issued (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.).

Looking at the derivatives market, the April 30, 2021 options have the largest open interest of 1,763 at the $320 strike for calls and an open interest of 642 at the $265 strike on puts (“Options Chain: FB”, n.d.). This implies a move of +/- 15% given the current price of approximately $280/share. 30-day Historical Volatility (HV30) is about 35% and the current Implied Volatility (IV) for Facebook is 35% (“Options Chain: FB”, n.d.). This suggests that the premiums for these contracts are as expensive as they have been in the past. Current shareholders of round lots should consider selling weekly call options to collect extra income. Prospective shareholders should consider selling weekly puts to collect income and acquire the stock at a lower cost basis.

**SWOT Analysis**

Facebook's greatest strength is its advertising solutions that it provides to businesses. This is especially helpful to small businesses that often have simple advertising budgets and need to drive as much return on ad spend (ROAS) as they possibly can. Contrary to what a low information public perceives, Facebook does not sell user data and they do not sell personal data (“Does Facebook Sell My Information?”, n.d.). The company uses data that is voluntarily given by their users to provide advertisers highly targeted, anonymous, audiences for their advertising needs.

Their weakness is also related to their core revenue model in that Facebook’s business is driven almost entirely through advertising revenue. Having such a highly concentrated business model leaves the company vulnerable to headwinds. As mentioned on the Q4 2020 earnings call by Wehner, “We also expect to face more significant ad targeting headwinds in 2021. This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape” (“Facebook Q4 2020 Earnings”, 2021, p. 9). Apple will make it harder for publishers to run digital advertising for users on iOS14 and this will present a problem to many businesses.

Facebook’s short-term opportunities include efforts to further monetize their portfolio of other applications and digital properties. If Facebook can continue to commercialize Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, these properties will fuel continued revenue growth. For example, virtual reality is emerging technology and there is massive potential with Oculus VR to provide entertainment through virtual reality games, tourism, education, and more. As a segue into the threats, another opportunity for Facebook is in public relations and educating a low information public about Facebook’s operations and combat misinformation.

Facebook’s threats are concentrated around government intervention. Between a low information public and a low information government body, Facebook faces a very real threat from antitrust litigation and repealing section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). Section 230 protects website owners from civil liabilities due to user generated content and allows platforms to regulate content largely as they see fit (“47 U.S. Code §230”, n.d.). Both Republican and Democrat administrations have expressed their desire to repeal section 230 which could potentially eviscerate Facebook and other internet companies if that were to happen.

**Conclusion**

Facebook should keep doing what they are, as it is clearly working and has been working for about a decade now. To remain competitive, they should focus on expanding their revenue outside of advertising. This can be done through mergers and acquisitions or new product introduction.  If they do not wish to diversify their business operations outside of advertising, then they should consider paying a dividend and improve operating margin expansion. If interest rates were to rise over the next year or so, that should not pose a problem to the company since they have high levels of cash, negligible debt, and impressive margins. They should also keep their expenses in lobbyists and lawyers to protect themselves from antitrust litigation or legislation that may result in section 230 being repealed. Finally, they should launch a series of PR campaigns to influence public opinion as the company is routinely subject to controversy, both real and imagined. Love it or hate it, the bottom line is that Facebook is an extremely profitable company that is wildly undervalued by the current market when compared to its peers.

4/6/21 10:08,"$GOEV - Bullish theory - USPS Truck Contract Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.


Once I saw the Canoo trucks on their promotional video I thought there is promise for the modularity of them being good candidates for the new USPS truck. But the USPS truck contract was given to Oshkosh Corporation, right? Well maybe. Turns out someone bought 55 million shares before the contract went public. Speculation: If the SEC finds misconduct will the deal be null and void? The vehicles are not due till 2023. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Corporation (I have no idea how government contacts are dealt with)

If the bid is undone I think there are a couple good reasons they are a valid candidate.

**E.V. low speed efficiencies**

Electric Vehicles have insane gains on energy consumption at low speed. 

[Power Consumption Curve for Tesla Model S](https://i.stack.imgur.com/e98Er.png) ([post](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-physics.101931/)). Now I found an [article^1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213624X17300974) that concluded that switching Austin's USPS trucks to diesel trucks would cut down emissions. They used a speed of 15 mhp to run their simulations, note motor vehicles do not get the same energy gains at low speeds as e.v.[1]. I am not gonna even try to factor in the speeding up and down or the real characteristic of the battery pack (there will be energy loss but its Tesla's job to make these batteries as efficient as they can be). The [NEDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) estimates that full charge of 85 kWh can be discharged in 315 miles. User [Frank99](https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/177605/full-charge-range) found he can ride at around 244 Wh/mi for 40 miles at 70 mph. This took Frank 4/7 h or 0.57 hours.
 

With a size of 75k Wh for a total battery comes out to 75k Wh / 244 Wh / mi  = 307.38 miles. Pretty close to the NEDC estimation.

307 mi * (0.57 hours / 40 miles) = 4.385h of driving for an entire charge.

Total Watt hour consumed: 244 Wh/mi * 40 mi = 9.760 kWh

Referring to the first graph the car would be around 300 kW 'consumption' for the majority of the time. The energy spent to hold at that level was 9.760 kWh for 0.57 hours of driving at 70 mph. Now suppose you only need to run to say 15 miles an hour well now you would just need to hold it at 125 kW. Now here's where real research people would know how much of a reduction  in total power consumption this would be. I will guess the reduction to be around 1.5x (9.760 / 1.5 -> 6.467 kWh) this puts the range of the Tesla Model S to over 450 miles before a recharge, but you can kinda just plug in value here and then multiple it with 307 to get your new range. I think anything between 1 and 2 is a good estimate because the reduction in the overall energy cost is a little over 2. 

Now I could not find information on this but I think a USPS truck travel less than 450 miles a day. 

Canoo is probably following Tesla and just letting/following the EPA give their estimated ranges or not even publishing them because so much of the battery life is dependent on the driver's habits.

For viewing pleasure: https://www. yt .com/watch?v=rbnvZlPZZQc

**Modularity**

A general problem for the U.S. has is finding parts for stuff that is old.
The previous USPS fleet truck was designed as Life Long Vehicle and their repair cost went through the roof as time goes on. The USPS even acknowledged this back in 2010 ([pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20100714015726/http://www.uspsoig.gov/foia_files/DA-AR-10-005.pdf)). Per Canoo's promotional video they are focusing on reliability and resell ability.


**Replacing other LLV**

The deal with Oshkosh Corporation was for 50,000 to 165,000 to be produced. In 2010 there were 189,000 LLVs. There could be a cap for 165k LLVs now. Oshkosh could be capped at 50k if the USPS decides to revisit this after the investigation, as I do not think the plan of leaving 90% un-electrified fits with the current party.


[1] Tractor and stuff run at pretty low rpm on diesel so there is a chance to get close to e.v. levels of gains with new science but I haven't done the research, but pulling from article^1 the power consumption is 10x greater with their Diesel van than their electric van listed and they just use money. Coal factories as bad as they are way more efficient than car's when it comes to making energy.

4/8/21 00:59,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compare to other EV companies Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companies

Arcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.

4/7/21 08:46,"Right Wing Billionaire, Charles Koch, Is Backing INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR CANNABIS. TilAphria 🚀🚀🚀 Trulieve 💩💩💩 [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/2021/04/06/charles-koch-snoop-dogg-marijuana-legalization-479148](here is the article)

Snoop Dogg and Charles Koch's group ""Americans for Prosperity(AFP)"" are working together to form the Cannabis Freedom Alliance (CFA). I know everyone is **shocked** by Snoop Dogg's support, but let's focus on the highly influential right wing group: AFP. 

>""Americans for Prosperity, founded by the Koch brothers in 2004, is one of the most influential organizations in conservative politics. The group rivals and even eclipses the official GOP in terms of its size, scope and spending.""

Directly from the article. So now cannabis is getting support from conservatives, in a big way, and conservatives **love** free and open markets. They will tell you where you can put your regulations, just ask em. So, on top of a **much better** chance of getting 10-12 Republicans to vote in favor of Cannabis, which is great news for everyone, this is also **AMAZING** news for Candian LP's like TilAphria, and bad news for MSOs like TruShit. I mean Trulieve. 

Don't believe me? According to one of the founders of the CFA (from the article): 

>""A lot of big cannabis companies are fighting against things like interstate commerce because it doesn’t support their business model,” Angelos said. “That’s another reason why [AFP] is a perfect ally on this because they support free and open markets.”

*Weeeeeeeeird*. Do you guys think it's ""big cannabis companies"" like TilAphria or other large LPs fighting the interstate commerce, or *maybe* ones like Trulieve who are desperately clinging on to their dying business models? If interstate commerce is allowed, it will cost LPs only **shipping costs** to send their products to all 50 states, and their juicy markets. They already sit on an excess of product and grow space, just waiting for bigger markets. 

Meanwhile, Trulieve spent 60m+ on 2 retail stores, then diluted. 🤦. So whatever markets they just spent 60m on, will eventually be available to everyone else (LPs and MSOs) for the **cost of shipping** to their stores or other new stores in the same area, post legalization with interstate commerce. No real long term cannabis company is focused on building a retail focused business. Just ask Curaleaf (read their ER) why their EU expansion is so exciting. They have **no** intentions of vertically integrating AND INSTEAD are building large manufacturing and distributing centers to serve large regions. Ya know, like Coke or Marlboro or Corona or literally any other CPG giant. Y'all been in a Coke owned store lately? Hm. How about the Corona ones? Hm.... Well, surely the Marlboro store? Those are everywhere!......

The kind of the interesting thing about the switch from a medical market to a recreational market is that 100% of the time, some of the the biggest opponents of the switch from medical to recreational are the current medical companies. Why would they want a bunch of new competition, regulations, and taxes? They don't. They fight the bills in the name of ""patients rights"" or some other made up bullshit. 

Then there's the other side of the coin. Once the switch from medical to recreational finally does happen, medical companies tend to find a lot less recreational companies wanting to work with them than they'd like. When you have to sit on the sidelines while someone else builds a monopoly, you aren't too keen to help them. 

Recreational business owners aren't stupid either. They are fully aware of those helping reinforce the ""status quo."" So, imagine you were to open a recreational marijuana dispensary after waiting for **years** in Florida, and a Trulieve sales rep walks in with their shitty logo on his shirt, how likely would *you* be to put their products on your shelf? I mean, why would you when there would be countless other brands to choose from with no retail presence? You wouldn't. It would make no sense. People who want Trulieve product can just go to a Trulieve store. Plus, wouldn't you purposefully **not**carry the same thing as your direct competitor, and especially their own in house brands? Unless you're ""Cookies,"" I just don't see that happening, and Trulieve AINT ""Cookies."" 

From a customer or ""patient"" perspective, in Florida, are you going to a Trulieve store for the 1,536th time after legalization, or ""Starbuds"" that just opened down the road with ""100+ new brands!"" sign out front?  Best case scenario would be Trulieve also adds a huge new line of other companies brands to their shelves, but is that really *good* news for them? They'd lose say 30-60% of their shelf space across all 70+ stores. That's gonna cause a surplus of weed for them pretty quickly.

They currently make so much money because they essentially own a monopoly on stores, and a monopoly on products within those stores. You want weed and live in FL? There's a 50% chance you're going to a Trulieve store, and a 100% chance you'll get a Trulieve product in that store. I've never seen something more ""priced in"" in my entire life, yet people still think Trulieve is going higher. Trulieve is only $40+ because of the *current* market regulations. Take away the favorable regulations, and you take away Trulieve, and get TruShit. 

Post legalization, each Trulieve store will just be one of **X** amount in a town selling weed. Florida currently has a dispensary ratio of around 1.1. Fully legal states have ratios closer to 10. Thats 10x the competition, just to get customers in the door. Even **if** they do come in Trulieve's door, they may not even buy a Trulieve product since they would be forced to carry other brands as well as their own.

Not every MSO is fighting for a fully legal market, and it's pretty obvious to point out the ones who could potentially be **hurt** the most by a free and open market. TruShit being king among them. In my retarded opinion, wholesale focused MSOs and LPs are much much much better long term options for a legal market. Stop investing in a dying medical market, 🤷.

4/6/21 06:50,"The Bull-Case for Lordstown Motors Corporation (RIDE) – Never Bet Against America Disclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion.

&#x200B;

Recently, [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report.

Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down.

And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things:

1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC.
2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth.

Okay, let’s get started.

&#x200B;

**First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.**

Per Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

U.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\*\*\*\*.”*

“I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye.

&#x200B;

**Now, onto an overview of LMC:**

GM invested in LMC back in 2019 in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). They are working towards mass production this September with their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance).  [LMC now has over 500 employees with plans to be at 1,500 by production this September](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio). They believe that when the facility is at full capacity in 3-5 years, they will be able to produce 600,000 vehicles a year, due to the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all).

&#x200B;

**Enter Short-Seller Hindenburg Research, who first announced they took a short position in RIDE stock last month, and then slandered them in the media just to make a profit:**

I will now break down the main components of Hindenburg’s “research report.” Let’s jump right in.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC is 3-4 years away from production**

Hindenburg claims that they spoke to some “undisclosed former employees” who told them that LMC is way behind on beta production and won’t be able to actually produce anything until 2024 or 2025. Hindenburg didn’t even request to take a tour of LMC’s facility to back-up their claims.

Well, at the end of last week, LMC proved this wrong by [revealing their first betas](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas). This shows that they are very close to mass-production; these betas are coming off the production line and [being welded by robots](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). These betas are essentially 97% of the finished vehicle, and will be [used for crash, engineering and validation testing](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Betas will also be given to initial customers for feedback. LMC’s Endurance already has a 5-Star crash test rating via software crash simulation. Plus, contrary to Hindenburg’s report, LMC confirmed that production is still on target for September of this year.

The betas are going to be a huge catalyst for the stock going forward, and they were just publicly revealed at the end of last week. Now, LMC plans to produce one beta every day for the next 2 months.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that a LMC development mule that caught fire in January was the “first ever test-drive”**

Well, if the first ever test drive was in January, why is there video evidence of test drives as early as [October](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1321504690362818567?s=20) and [November](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?s=20) of last year? Clearly, this vehicle has been on the road for well over 7 months now. Also, the development mule that caught fire [had already been addressed a couple of months ago by LMC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire) prior to Hindenburg’s report.

Ultimately, that development mule was not built on the assembly line and it was not using the actual batteries that their truck will utilize. It caught on fire as a result of human error, which will not be the case going forward since they are at beta phase with robots are welding the trucks instead of humans.

To address the fire / battery issue, [LMC announced they will now use “Tesla” batteries from LG Chem](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.). Oh, and what do you know, [LG Chem is partnering with GM to build batteries right next to LMC’s facility](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/gm-lg-lordstown-ultium-cells-hiring/). 

Btw - that’s Marcus Lemonis (CEO of Camping World) driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a [long-term partnership with LMC](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

Plans for the 1st ever all-electric RV are being released this summer by LMC in conjunction with Camping World. As a reminder, the [North American RV market is valued at \~ $27 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-recreational-vehicle-market), and the growth has actually accelerated due to the pandemic. Enormous opportunity here for both LMC and Camping World with the world’s first ever all-electric RV.

This claim by Hindenburg about January being “the first ever test-drive” is clearly false.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC’s 100,000 pre-orders are largely fictitious / SEC also “inquires” about pre-orders**

First and foremost, the SEC opens thousands of “inquiries” each year. This is not an investigation, even though all of the click-bait articles going around right now would make you think it was. These sites literally make money based on clicks, which is why the media has also blown the story out of proportion – just to get increased viewership. That’s the sad reality of the world we live in.

This is currently a voluntary reveal of information and documents from LMC to the SEC, and they are fully cooperating. This type of thing has happened to Tesla countless times, and many other start-ups as well. I will include a brief example in the comments below on how Wall Street capitalizes from FUD when the SEC gets involved.

Additionally, regarding the pre-orders, go look at basically ANY EV company. They all utilize *non-binding pre-orders*. [LMC has made this clear from day 1](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-remains-on-track-to-begin-production-of-the-lordstown-endurance-in-the-fall-of-2021) – all pre-orders are non-binding letters of intent (LOI). LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house.

Hindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren’t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they’ve put on paper – and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the [E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/#:~:text=The%20Hindenburg%20report%20also%20said%20Lordstown%20Motors%20allegedly,Energy%2C%20came%20to%20the%20defense%20of%20Lordstown%20Motors.) after Hindenburg’s report and confirmed he still plans to fill all 14,000 orders over a 3-year period.

&#x200B;

**What Hindenburg failed to understand during their “research”**

Lordstown is targeting fleets: fleets don’t always buy directly from auto manufacturers. They frequently buy from intermediaries and service partners. Most commonly, these intermediaries and service partners are small/medium sized companies, and it’s critical to develop relationships with these types of partners early and often.

Developing these relationships is exactly what LMC is doing, as they recently announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).

Sure, not all 100,000 of the current pre-orders will come to fruition for LMC, but demand isn’t the issue here. LMC is putting out a [simple and economical vehicle for fleets](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/). What do fleet managers care about? Cost and efficiency.

LMC’s all-electric *Endurance* truck comes in at a $45,000 price point, and the simplicity of the vehicle will lead to less maintenance and a lower total cost of ownership than any options currently available to fleets. This is a no brainer.

LMC firmly believes their demand is robust, and they have already said they are going to sell way more than they can even produce the first two years. All of the talk from the recent Infrastructure bill/proposal sure helps LMC’s future prospects as well. They also have stated that they have interest from the gov/military for the federal fleet, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).

&#x200B;

**And lastly, Hindenburg makes claims that CEO Steve Burns is a con-man**

I decided to do some deep digging on this. Was there a chance he was trying to pump up the stock price in the short-term by over-exaggerating orders so he could dump off his shares for profit like the Nikola founder did?

What I found by digging deep through [LMC’s form 10-K](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001558370-21-003449) was that, this is not the case. Burns doesn’t really have incentive to pump-up the stock in the short-term with the pre-order announcements. This is because, per page 33 of the 10-K, “any shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will be locked-up until October 23, 2021, and 50% of such shares will continue to be locked up until October 23, 2022.”

&#x200B;

**Why is this finding significant?**

Well, this means that Burns can’t sell a single share until AT LEAST October 23 of this year. In fact, I think this creates a HUGE incentive for him to hit their September production target.

Think about everything the Lordstown community has been through last few years, and now a short-seller comes out with a bunch of inaccurate claims to slander LMC’s reputation in the media just to turn a profit.

I would be willing to bet that LMC now has a huge chip on their shoulder to continue to prove all of the doubters and short-sellers wrong. LMC made significant progress in refuting Hindenburg’s claims by having betas coming off the assembly line at the end of last week. Actions speak louder than words.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

Hindenburg made several inaccurate accusations in their report, and as a result, I view $RIDE as one of the best buying opportunities that I have ever seen in my 5+ years of investing. I will be watching this stock very closely in the next week or so, and I will look to increase my position substantially if this touches $11.

Sure, there are risks. But, even with minor setbacks, LMC has shown they are very close to mass-production. They will soon have the first all-electric *full-size* pick-up truck for fleets. These things will sell like hot cakes once they begin production.

&#x200B;

**Position:**

500 shares that I will be holding onto for several years, and I am looking to add October calls for once they are pumping out trucks this fall.

I’m not directly comparing LMC to Rivian; but, think about it like this: Rivian’s expected IPO valuation is $50B this year. RIDE currently has a $1.9B market cap. So, If LMC is able to achieve even half ($25B) of Rivian’s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

[Lordstown Motors is going to change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20) – literally an American underdog story.

4/10/21 00:52,"DD on Coupang and why it can it can moon As you may have known CPNG recently IPO'd with the valuation of about $35, leading many to believe that the stock price is currently overvalued. I've taken a quick look at this company along with $SE and I'm bullish on CPNG. What I expect is for this company to demonstrate to the market what theoretical saturation really looks like.

My reasons:

1. South Korea is a considerably large, dense, wealthy country with income equality. Wealth equality is overlooked when comparing Asia. e-commerce stores themselves thrive on middle-income participants. There is no comparison in Asia.

&#x200B;

2) Their lifestyles are extremely busy compared to the rest of the world and the tradeoff for money over convenience is likely going to create a flywheel effect. G-Market is considered the cheaper option to Coupang for now, but as volume increases, prices are likely to fall.

&#x200B;

3) Companies in S Korea, unlike SEA or China, are extremely ""Chaebol"". The large brick and mortar retailers have historically marked up their products. The standard was to sell something for multiple times MSRP Lately they have been getting destroyed by e-commerce and most of the e-commerce is being destroyed by Coupang. Ebay Korea has been looking to sell their position in the market for a fraction of the valuation of Coupang, but nobody is interested in buying. The number of competitors mean nothing.

&#x200B;

4) Coupang owns the entire supply chain, up and down. They own the inventory and they own the drivers and warehouses. Their algorithms are extremely good as well and it is catered to the Korea audience. As they gain control of this market and crush out the competition, Coupang will have significantly more pricing power. Their Amazon Price subscription is mere $2.5 USD a month.

&#x200B;

5) Receiving $4.6 billion dollars in cash is absolutely insane, given that we've been able to see how far they have been able to stretch the $3 billion from SoftBank.

&#x200B;

6) Coupang has demonstrate the deepest ability to monetize their consumers in the market. $SE has leaned on its extremely profitable gaming arm Garena to fuel infrastructure. But market depth and consumer service quality is unparalleled. Consumers trust Coupang enough to buy groceries on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

7) This company trades a significant discount to its peers for a few reasons, the lack of an AWS-like product. The reality is, Coupang is currently deploying the $4 billion dollars to tack on higher margin technology services. If you look at the second revenue line, the other sources of income is currently small, but growing rapidly.  The company looks poised to completely control a passive, wealthy and easily marked up audience upselling them on a wide range of products unheard of in other e-commerce platforms. Once that objective is completed, their services become exponentially more valuable.

&#x200B;

8) Currently sales are $11 billion dollars, looking to trend to $22 billion in sales for next year. Best Buy currently trades at $16 billion in sales and is roughly $30 billion, which is roughly about what Coupang trades in line at (\~ currently priced at $50 billion but adding on a much faster growth rate would place the company north of that line, $80 billion is rich but reasonable). The key thing is that adding additional product lines has been very easy. Kroger alone has about $60 billion in perishable food sales and Coupang is the only e-commerce company in the world to really have controlled this type of market. Companies with no foothold in grocery stores are likely never going to have that going forward. Purchases by parents are built on an immense level of trust and are not price sensitive. Chewy sells pet food (another super insensitive purchase category). There's a lot of $$$ to be made here.

&#x200B;

9) The owner is relatively good at pivoting and one hell of an operator so realistically you will not be able to buy the stock before the news comes out when they find their best new hot thing to drop $4.6 billion on. The best thing to do is wait for this stock to trade sideways for a while and pick up what you can while the narrative is focused on the inability to leave their home country (which ultimately will be the story for every e-commerce investment).

&#x200B;

10) Hostility to Coupang being unable to enter other spaces is overblown, other than general hatred for Chinese and the Japanese having hatred for specifically Koreans and humorous hatred for foreigers who don't take the time to learn a culture, there is no reason why Coupang can't compete in SEA. I've never seen this level of market domination in a competitive environment with reasonable profitability outside of Amazon. $SE has the advantage of Blue Skies and SEA gamer boys, but nobody can club heads like Coupang.

4/9/21 10:57,"Nanox: Medical Imaging Disruptor **ABOUT NANOX IMAGING (NNOX)**

* Israeli company that has developed a [digital scanning system](https://www.nanox.vision/our-technology) and medical screening software to replace large/costly machines and software used for X-rays, CT scans, PET scans, and other body imaging services
* NNOX uses a nano-scale, silicon-based field as the X-ray source, as a low-voltage alternative to traditional machines which heat a metal filament to 2000 degrees Celsius
* The main NNOX commercial unit weighs 70kg and costs $10k to produce, compared to current devices which weigh 2000kg and cost $1-3 million
* Reduced heating via cold cathode tech extends machine lifespan
* **Dumbed down for us retards: an X-ray machine that's smaller, cheaper, lasts longer, and uses less power**
* NNOX has 3 main products. A single source NANOX.arc device, a multi source NANOX.arc device (made up of the single source device, this will be the commercial product), and NANOX.cloud (the software subscription that comes along with the device, the recurring revenue stream)

**ABOUT MUDDY WATERS**

* NOT the legendary singer / songwriter / father of modern Chicago blues, we're instead talking about the short selling firm **muddy waters research**
* Essentially, muddy waters finds high growth companies, publicly bashes the company, then shorts it relentlessly
* [Muddy in 2019, saying Tesla will go bankrupt.](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/01/tesla-will-go-bankrupt-muddy-waters-researchs-cio.html)


**THE SITUATION**

Muddy waters published a NNOX short report in September 2020. It read **""NNOX has no real product to sell other than its stock""**. Essentially calling it a complete scam. They are fairly active on twitter, tweeting about NNOX, at times ramping up activity as they increase their short positions. Typical short seller tactics, calling every product fraudulent and accusing any insider selling stock as proof of a ponzi scheme.

NNOX April 1st closing price was $41.33. Single source **FDA clearance was announced Friday April 2nd** (markets closed due to Jesus). Monday April 5th NNOX opened at $64.00, after hitting $70+ in pre-market. Shares started dropping from this high right at the opening bell and closed at $48.55.

*Enter SSR*

**SHORT SALE RESTRICTION (SSR) RULE**

For those who don't know, when a security **drops 10% or more** (at anytime during the day) from the previous day closing price, SSR is triggered and the opening of new short positions in that security is limited. Under SSR, new short positions can only be opened as stock prices goes up, and this remains in effect until the end of the next day. Essentially **SSR makes it much harder/riskier to short sell successfully.** When a big short seller has enough control of a stock, they can **tactically keep the intraday drop to slightly under 10%, to avoid SSR while maximizing profits**.

On Tuesday, the NNOX low of the day was $43.71, a 9.97% drop from Monday close. That's an extra **0.03% drop away from SSR**. On Wednesday, the low was $40.40, a 9.74% drop from Tuesday close. That's an extra **0.26% drop away from SSR**. Sure we can't rule out this out as a coincidence, so we'll just call it **statistically extremely improbable.**

Despite a disagreement of their thesis from the FDA, muddy appears to be playing their usual games.

**SHORT VOLUME**

If any one of you autists has access to **updated** short interest %, please share. Meanwhile [short volume is here](https://imgur.com/Z79jHw1). Jump in short:volume ratio has sustained post fda approval announcement.

**TODAY**

This morning, there was more positive news for NNOX, involving a partner's (FujiFilm) **[patent filing](https://twitter.com/TerraPharma1/status/1380137316434341890) that would use Nanox rights and IP for innovative mammography equipment**. This news may have helped create a small pop in NNOX price this morning, but once again the shorts squashed any bounce and brought NNOX to even lower levels than yesterday. NNOX closed today at $40.08, a **lower price than it was before FDA clearance**, only three market days after the news. 

**PRICE ACTION**

For anyone familiar with price action when a big short seller is involved, the [NNOX 5 day chart](https://imgur.com/PiFaFfD) paints a pretty clear picture. A gradual slide each day, with any potential peak quickly snuffed out and brought back down to a new low.

**CONCLUSION**

Before Ellen_Degenerate_69 chimes in, you're right, selling on news is nothing new. However, context matters. The majority of the bear thesis hinged on a lack of regulatory clearance. **Recent price action, short volume, and narrow SSR avoidance is all consistent with a big player at the table**. Considering their outspokenness on this company, all signs point towards muddy waters & co.

**TLDR: Nanox (NNOX) has the potential to revolutionize medical imaging, recently reached a milestone with FDA clearance, shares have been dragged down by 🌈🐻’s, and is de-risked at current levels. I like the stock.**

I can't wait to get my bikini on and hit the beach and day drink by the pool. Me and my girls are gonna be hitting the movie theatres now that we got the vaccine and the box offices have opened back up. Love all the DD on here. u/FreakyPheobe also got a Bloomberg Terminal so let me share all my goodness! Please comment and UPVOTE if you like what you see and I'll post more depending on what you all want to see this summer!! I finally got enough karma to post on WSB so let's GO!!!

[US Weekly Box Office Grosses \($\) - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/tu8r6jo3rst61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d0fced0cbc3ace032915b3d860fe811bead118f)

I know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and ""day-and-date,"" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks.

***1)  ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to Top Box Office Again***

It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released.

[US Box Office Projections for April 16 - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/bf44qo0oust61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c44c55b0aa8766766dca657d4030366f74594ae4)

***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***

With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal & AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies ""Cruella"" and ""Black Widow"" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's ""Mortal Kombat"" will be out on April 16.

***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***

Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film’s overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, “[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)” already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan’s puzzling sci-fi thriller “Tenet,” which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.

***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***

In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March. Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon” is projected to take the weekend’s top spot, while Roadside Attraction’s “The Courier” are other notable new films releasing this weekend. (Source: Bloomberg 4/17/21)

***5) Wall Street ""Hate-Love"" Relationship***

Wall Street analysts absolutely HATED the stock in 2020. From May 2020 to March 2021 there wasn't a single BUY rating. B. Riley analyst Eric Wold was the FIRST to put a BUY rating on AMC since the pandemic. On Friday he said that the CEO’s comments on the share authorization should be interpreted as good news on AMC’s cash position for the year.

On Wednesday, Aron told YouTube host Trey Collins in an interview on “Trey’s Trades”: “We hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.”

Aron also said AMC still has authorization to issue 43 million shares “that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.” Excerpts of the interview were [disclosed in a securities filing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921050489/tm2113075d1_defa14a.htm)dated Thursday.

Over the past year Wall Street analysts still keeps a fairly high rating on the stock,

***5) AMC Lightens Up Debt Like GME***

Like all companies, going into the pandemic highly levered (with tons of debt) wasn't a good idea, which is not surprising that so many hedge funds went after GME and AMC. GME recently announced that they are going to be debt free and AMC also lightened up their load this year when various PE firms like Silver Lake and Mudrick coverted their convertible notes into equity.

[AMC's debt in coming years is low and at a very low interest rate \(sub 3&#37;\), with the majority of its callable debt maturing in 2026. The company is now generating cash flow again which will easily have plenty of runway to get them through 2021 and to 2026. They should have no liquidity issues this year so as long as theatres continue to re-open. \(Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21\)](https://preview.redd.it/o6kgwc4f9ut61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b8df16a0de21a46980107df20eeb7e1e4df7387)

***6) SHORT INTEREST BACK UP***

Almost at 100% utilization, and 93.92MM shares short interest, next week will be interesting. Borrowing rates have also jumped back up this week. For those who are hoping for a gamma squeeze or short squeeze, I'm sure there are tons of you already reading other DDs and watching YouTube videos so I don't need to explain here. We're all here to make money. I'll be honest, I did a YOLO bet using AMC Call Options on the first pump up to $20 in late Jan and paperhanded and took gainz on the ride up. Now that the stock has pulled back to a decent level, this time I'm using shares, as there is just way too much market manipulation going on in the weekly options expirations with the market makers. This week, I saw tons of tutes coming in buying big blocks (100,000 to 1,000,000 share blocks) of AMC throughout the week, and I started accumulating from the high $8 range. Will continue to watch the MaxPain and options activity in coming days and weeks and play the trading range in addition to HOLDing shares.

In case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdex64/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me13xm/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme/)

To summarize I am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions.  I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting. I am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions I have recorded no one has paper handed. Previously I had recorded 261 yolos holding 339,958 shares.

**Updated Data:** Since then I have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of **473** positions representing **576,433** shares. With current after hours share prices of $160.81 these shares represent **$92,696,190.73** or for those that can't read big numbers **92.7 million**.

As I had mentioned in my previous posts I personally believe the [rule of 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10-100 that are silent. Just for fun if we apply the 1:9:90 ratio for content creator, upvoter  and viewer. We can make a some what irresponsible estimates of  silent whales :

1:9= 4,257 Silent WSB Kongs with 5,187,897 shares.

Either way retail owns a lot and can make an big impact by holding.

4/16/21 02:48,"$MDU - Strong Financials, Consistent Growth, Solid Dividend - Why MDU Resources is a Buy I wanted to find a stable company to add to my portfolio. One with strong fundamentals, a decent dividend and solid growth potential. I came across MDU Resources, headquartered in North Dakota and operates as a diversified utility, pipeline, construction services company.

MDU Resources has continued to execute well amidst a challenging economy. It recently achieved near record-breaking results and has strategic investments planned for this year. I have highlighted some of the key points on my analysis below

Company

Construction and utility provider MDU Resources (MDU) had a tough 2020. Construction projects were halted or delayed in a lot of cases, and utility stocks weren’t exactly in favor with investors during a period when growth stocks reigned supreme. Still, for long-term investors with an eye on value and yield, I think MDU is a great choice.

MDU Resources Group, Inc.’s MDU two-platform business model, strategic acquisitions, capital investments in the electric and natural gas utility plus improving backlog are its key tailwinds. Also, the company boasts enough liquidity to meet its near-term obligations.

Some key highlights on why I think it might be a good pick up for your portfolio

**Consistent long-term growth at 9.3% EBITDA CAGR and 16.7% EPS CAGR**

* Stocks with higher earnings-per-share growth rates are generally more desired by investors than those with slower earnings-per-share growth rates. This is a good sign for MDU and has a decent shot at beating earnings upcoming in early May
* Balance of cyclical and counter cyclical business with almost a 50/50 split between construction and regulated energy. this bodes well for the long run and will likely be a stable performer in the market

**Runway of attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities**

* Organic Growth: We are all familiar with the infrastructure spending bill that was passed in the UIS and MDU stand to benefit from this.
* Inorganic Growth: **MDU Resources (MDU) Arm Buys Mt. Hood Rock, Expands in Portland (**[**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdu-resources-mdu-arm-buys-163304894.html)**)** These investments will be aimed at enhancing the reliability of the company’s services, thus enabling it to serve an increasing customer base, effectively. MDU Resources anticipates its electric and natural gas utility segment to see a CAGR of 5% and expects its customer base to expand 1-2%, annually.

**Improving ROIC driven by rigorous capital allocation process**

* Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.
* A company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds 2% and destroying value if it is less than 2%. MDU Resources Group's ROIC % is 6.29% (calculated using TTM income statement data).
* MDU Resources Group generates higher returns on investment than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment. It is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases.

**Valuation**

I find MDU to be attractively priced at $31.29, with a blended PE of 15.9. This sits below MDU's historical PE of 19.4 over the past decade,

Analysts also express a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $34.33, implying a 10% upside potential from the current share price.

**Earnings**

Earnings are forecast to grow 6.74% per year and Earnings grew by 16.6% over the past year. If this trend continues, we will likely see a rise in the share price

**Insider Trading**

Significant insider buying over the last year with a majority of shares purchased in May 2020. This would make sense considering the price dropped off a cliff just a month prior. The management team knew it was a bargain and acted on the low share price

https://preview.redd.it/mm0ufvp1zct61.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a48dd33dfa8bc4e1266ce88b085e687234e36f4

# Risks

**Biden’s Infrastructure Plan** \- While I see potential tailwinds for MDU's construction business from Biden's proposed infrastructure plan, there's no guarantee that such a proposal will pass. The construction business is more cyclical than the regulated utility business, and adds complexity risk to MDU's business model.

**Mild Dilution** \- MDU relies on both equity and debt to fund capital projects. This includes $100M in expected equity issuances this year, which will be mildly dilutive to shareholders

# TLDR

I'm encouraged by the impressive earnings it generated amidst a challenging economy. Based o some of the key factors and management guidance I see continued growth for MDU for the foreseeable future. I continue to find the valuation to be attractive and the dividend to be well-covered and safe. Consider looking at MDU and potentially adding it to your portfolio.

Selling to fleets vs focusing on straight to consumer is a much better business plan as the infrastructure for EV hasn’t been built out yet. Contractors can leave vehicle to charge overnight vs with consumers who need electric charging infastructure.

Shorts like Hindenburg have beaten the stock down through complete BS like semantics regarding preorders. Lawsuits have been widely publicized to beat this down. Reality is - Every EV company including Rivian is being sued and suing each other.

First off, I don’t write DD’s. However, a user in the daily thread questioned my commitment to r/wallstreetbets. So here we go. Fuck you for making me do homework.

Also, I’m not going to mention short interest because you should invest in shit for better reasons (my personal opinion).

# 🚀 Energy Transfer ($ET) 🚀

&#x200B;

**Background**

Lets start this bitch by telling you who these guys (and gals) are. ET is basically a pipeline company that move, processes, and stores natural gas. They also do similar shit with crude oil.

ET has great diversity in their portfolio, with no single segment contributing more than 30% of the Partnership’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months or full year ended December 31, 2020. The vast majority of the Partnership’s segment margins are fee-based and therefore have limited commodity price sensitivity.

Lets get the bad shit out of the way. ET built itself into one of the largest midstream energy companies. However, being a big dawg comes with big risks. They became a financial, regulatory, and political liability. So, when that nastiness with the Dakota Access Pipeline happened, they got hit pretty hard and a judge ordered a review. HOWEVER, the army is allowing the pipeline to stay open during the review which should last till March 2022.

&#x200B;

**ET owns a lot of shit:**

* Only provider with export facilities on both the U.S. Gul Coast and East Coast
* Owns the largest above-ground oil facility in the U.S.
* controlling interests in Sunoco LP,
* 100% of Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations L.P.,
* the general partner of USA Compression Partners L.P.,
* 100% of Lake Charles LNG, which owns an LNG import terminal and regasification facility
* 9,400 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines
* 3 natural gas storage facilities in Texas
* 12,200 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines
* 36.4% of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline
* 60% of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline
* 50% of the Florida Gas Transmission pipeline,
* 100% of the Trunkline Pipeline, Transwestern Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern, Sea Robin Pipeline, Revolution Pipeline, and Mariner East Pipelines.
* 32.6% of the Rover Pipeline.

&#x200B;

**Renewable stuff if you’re into it:**

* \~20% of electrical energy purchased by ET originates from renewable sources (put your boner away Joey B)
* [https://cms.energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Powering-Renewables-FN.pdf](https://cms.energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Powering-Renewables-FN.pdf)

&#x200B;

**Technical Analysis:**

I don’t really believe in it. But here are some charts for you crayon eaters.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjrfu0ad6rx61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cced164fb934ee049def7be9e3ad07bbd217f7f

**Fundamentals and Recent Accomplishments/Developments:**

**Operational**

* In January 2021, the first Very Large Ethane Carrier (“VLEC”) was loaded under ET’s joint venture with Satellite Petrochemical USA Corp., Orbit Gulf Coast NGL Exports, LLC. The Seri Everest, the world’s largest VLEC, departed from Orbit’s newly constructed export facility at our Nederland Terminal in Nederland, Texas, as the largest single shipment of ethane to date.
* In December 2020, the Partnership completed the expansion of its Nederland Terminal LPG facilities to increase its export capabilities.
* Also during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Partnership completed a new 20-inch pipeline directly linking its fractionation and storage facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas to its Nederland Terminal.
* In October 2020, the Partnership released its Community Engagement Report, which highlights ET’s business achievements and safety programs, as well as its stakeholder outreach and community investment initiatives.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

* In February 2021, the Partnership announced the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, LP (“Enable”) in a $7.2 billion, all-equity transaction.
* In November 2020, the Partnership announced its first-ever dedicated solar power contract, which will reduce the Partnership’s environmental footprint by integrating alternative energy sources when economically beneficial. The Partnership continues to increase its focus on near and long-term alternative energy projects aimed at reducing its environmental footprint throughout its operations.
* In February 2021, the Partnership announced the creation of a new group that will focus on alternative energy initiatives.
* With the addition of ethane export facilities at our Nederland Terminal, the Partnership now owns two of the three U.S. ethane export terminals, and is the only company with export facilities on the Gulf Coast and East Coast.

&#x200B;

**Financial**

* In January 2021, ET announced a quarterly distribution of $0.1525 per unit ($0.61 annualized) on ET common units for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The distribution coverage ratio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 3.30x.
* As of December 31, 2020, Energy Transfer Operating, L.P.’s (“ETO’s”) $6.00 billion revolving credit facilities had an aggregate $2.79 billion of available capacity, and the leverage ratio, as defined by its credit agreements, was 4.31x.
* Energy Transfer completed 2020 with full-year Adjusted EBITDA of $10.53 billion, which was above the high end of estimates provided in August 2020.
* For 2021, the Partnership expects Adjusted EBITDA to be $10.6 billion to $11.0 billion, excluding any contribution from the recently announced Enable acquisition.
* For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership spent approximately $3.05 billion on growth capital expenditures. The Partnership expects to spend approximately $1.45 billion on growth capital expenditures in 2021, including approximately $250 million of 2020 growth capital that was deferred into 2021.

The fee based cash flow contributes to \~95% of their EBITDA. The fees come from transport and storage fees (duh).

Insider Ownership: 14.5% as of Dec 2020 which is pretty significant.

Average Daily Volume: 17.86 mil, so pretty liquid. But has bee above the average lately due to the blowout earnings.

Last Earnings was yesterday (May 6th) and they killed it by 306.01% for EPS (expected 0.3, reported 1.22) and 44.34% for revenue (expected 11.77B, reported 17B).

# Fair Value Estimate 🚀  🚀  🚀 :

    Tipranks: Strong Buy - $9.00-$16.00 ; Median @ 11.71
    Morningstar: 5 stars, $18

**Why I think it’s good:**

I’m getting bored so I’m going to keep this part short. I think ET is good because they have a strong balance sheet and are starting to rebound.

The Biden administration is going to make it difficult to get permits for pipeline companies. Paradoxically, this is *good* for the large, established pipeline companies like ET. Many operators have taken a growth-at-any-cost approach, looking to build empires irrespective of profitability. A world in which no new pipelines get built is a world in which serial empire builders like Energy Transfer have a lot more free cash on hand. 

ET basically just needs to sit back, and let the gas flow. Do nothing. Get Paid

Additionally, ET cut their dividend a while back. This has bee priced in and will allow them to aggressively pay off their debt.

And without the temptation to spend cash on new projects under a Biden administration, Energy Transfer could eventually be in a better position to buy back units or even begin building its distribution back up again. 

Also, ET is an alien. Aliens have rocket ships that can fly to the moon **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀** .

**Positions:**

Mostly calls since the volatility is low. I also park premium from my other strategies here, as shares.

    55 shares @ 8.47, but will be adding over time. Dividends are nice.

5/7/21 18:47,"Support for those that recognize By now everyone's has heard the AMC earnings call! Our Silverback leader AA stuck up for each and every ape and redditor out there.
He stood up to credit suisse and made sure Meg fully understood 3.2M apes own the float! They along with their leadership procoded the liquidity to run the tables and stave off bankruptcy and now thanks to these efforts have more liquidity than ever in the life of AMC
As I think back on today's ER there has only been two CEOs that have publicly thanked all of the apes for saving their company and not letting them be another Toys r us 
GMEs RC and AMCs AA.
I could be wrong but I haven't heard NIO ceo or SNDL ceo or even Blackberry CEO be so grateful to the apes and blue collar workers of America for keeping their companies in business 
For this reason in the morning I will begin liquidating my portfolio and placing my money where people and companies appreciate us investors and us retards and autists
AMC has already publicly stated apes own the float to the tune of 4/5 that's over 80%. Imagine if every ape believed in Top Gun or their first video game or their first cop a feel in the AMC theaters growing up..And felt they believed in keeping the American and European, Korean, Chinese, and so on dreams alive and dug deep and bought just one 9 dollar share of AMC or a fractional of GME with 9 dollars how the world might be in a few days. I by no means mean everyone buy cause if you don't believe in the people and companies that believe in us and have our backs cause we have theirs and have great fundamentals then yeah you shouldn't buy into it. But ... if you believe in fundamentals if you like the companies and their leadership and you,  just like them want to see the blue collar workers of America and Europe take back what we have built then buy a share to show back your appreciation. I truly believe AMC and GME might be in fact the first companies ever owned by the hard working people of America and not the ones in the ivory towers! Aaron said it best a year ago if I wanted to speak to our investors I'd go to China and speak with a company or two out there that owned us.. today I speak on behalf of the 3.2M redditors and apes on youtube and who knows.... if enough people like the stocks you might just make some money along the way! And might just cause a margin call or twenty! Apes Stick Togerher!

Recently it was announced that the company would have a secondary offering after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR) announced they would be selling their 14M share position. With this announcement, ASO announced they would be doing a buy back of 100M worth of shares to help off set this.

$ASO stock price opened around $30.87 on May 4th, the day after this was announced, leaving current holders to believe there would be a dip from the sell off. However, it has continue to climb since then reaching as high as $36.60 and was above $35 today before closing at $33.30, where +800K shares (+26.64M) were bought right after the closing bell. This was most likely KKR last shares as shortly after closing ASO released the following statement on their website about changes to their board where the following below was said.

""Academy also announced today that Vishal V. Patel and Aileen X. Yan, both designees of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (""KKR""), have resigned from the Board, effective immediately, **following a reduction in KKR's holdings in Academy through a secondary public offering that** **closed today.** ""

Now with all of KKR shares sold there is nothing stopping this stock from continuing to run up! NASDAQ releases their Short Interest Publication tomorrow at 4pm on settlements from 4/30/2021. Thsi will be something to keep an eye on with the high short float ASO has already had to see if any of the shorts have started to close their position. You would think that they would of cut their losses with KKR 14M unload but if they didn't then these hedges are screwed. We won't know for sure on this though until 5/25/2021 when NASDAQ releases their short interest up through 5/14/2021.

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ’s results are very similar to SPY’s results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

· In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

· Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

· QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

5/31/21 15:50,"Samsung Heavy shorts Hello APES

This is not financial advice.

I would like to share some information Korea has recently lifted a ban on short selling of stocks. Since the ban was lifted Samsung has become the most heavily shorted stock.

The ban was in effect from March 2020  - March 2021. During the pandemic Korea saw a huge amount of outflow from Korean ETFs and to limit this outflow Korea placed a ban on short selling.

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210530000128

With the ban lifted foreign investors have resumed heavily shorting many Korean stocks.

A few reasons of why I am bullish on Samsung.

1. The advances in 5G make it more likely people with older gadgets will make the move to newer models. Currently I think Samsung is the only company that can make its products with all Samsung parts (true end to end).

2. Samsung’s investment of $17 Billion into a chip facility is more than foreign investments. It’s a way for the company to move away from South Korea and maybe save on corporate taxes by using the same loopholes that many US tech giants use.

3. The recent $10 billion inheritance tax paid by the Lee family - Samsung owners. This readiness to pay such a ridiculous amount of money makes me think this might be used to pressure the current govt. to reduce the sentence of the heir and current CEO Lee Jae Yong.

4. A new president will be in office soon (10 months) if my understanding of foreign policy is correct. The current administration President Moon has been a real PAIN for Samsung. This has something to do with the former President and her close ties with the company.",47519,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.779101551,True
5/30/21 03:55,"AMC Volume Price Analysis   

Hey fellow traders. Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

20$ 07/16C AMC

30$ 07/16C AMC

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know. More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target.",47573,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.777378857,True

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down 🙌 Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions 🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

**Major (to me) News/Updates Since My Last Post, 3/15/2021:**

3/17/2021 - [KT beefs up cloud business](http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=305637) (talks about  ""currently generating 400 billion won in cloud sales, but considering our infrastructure, we aim to achieve 1 trillion won by 2023."")

4/09/2021 - [KT to build second ""Genie Music"" in Vietnam](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0003895173/office/011) (Genie music is their music streaming platform [which has 4.4 million subscribers](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/02/129_303991.html). I really like the localized strategy and I believe the investments like this will pay off big in the long run... Vietnam has nearly 100 million people, for your reference.)

4/14/2021 - [KT targets media and content growth](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0004884958/office/277) (talks about ""aim to secure 1,000 source IPs and produce more than 100 original contents by 2023)

5/18/2021 - [KT Corp opens data center in Seoul, in response to increased demand](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/kt-corp-opens-data-center-in-seoul-south-korea/) (this reiterates the growth targets mentioned in the 3/17/2021 article).

5/21/2021 - [Korean Analysts predicting stock will double by 2022](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202105210009) (Analysts seem to be digesting all the news and recent earnings postively... which is good to see. I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

Ongoing .... [A huge amount of patents being filed this year and last](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/ticker/KT?searchticker=KT). I haven't done too much research into their patent portfolio, but a couple new ones popped up this week which led me to the linked website. They seem to be protecting their 5G innovations a bunch...

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars? What is fair value for $KT?",48115,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.990970969,True

5/22/21 07:11,"Easy 10% Upside on LendingTree ($TREE)? After Northland Securities upgraded LendingTree’s price target to $225 (approx. 9.5% upside), I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT. 

# Company Overview

**LendingTree (NASDAQ: TREE)** is America’s largest online marketplace connecting lenders and borrowers. LendingTree empowers lenders to shop for financial services the same way one would shop for hotel stays or airline tickets- comparing multiple offers from a nationwide network of over 800 partners that offer their customers services such as mortgage loans, mortgage refinances, auto loans, personal loans, business loans, and much more. Their service also provides lenders with free credit scores, monitoring and improvements, and etc.

**Revenue Segments:**

* **Home Segment:** Generating revenue from real estate brokerage services through match fees paid by the real estate brokers participating in their marketplace
   * Accounts for **35.3% of total revenue** in 2020
* **Consumer Segment:** Generating revenue from credit repair and debt relief services through subscription fees from consumers that are enrolled in their credit repair product
   * Accounts for **27.8% of total revenue** in 2020
* **Insurance Segment:** Generating revenue from match fees when connecting leading insurance companies to consumers
   * Accounts for **36.7% of total revenue** in 2020

**Holdings Insight:**

* Institutional Holdings:
   * BlackRock Inc. raised its holding by 45.3% during the 4Q
   * Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc. raised holdings by 15.4% during 4Q
* Insider Transactions:
   * Independent Director G. Thompson purchase 1.4M worth of share at about $282/share
   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006
   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold
   * Sales in January 2020 were 22% stronger than in December 2019
* 51% of mortgage lenders are non-banks
   * 5 of the largest mortgage lenders in the U.S are non-banks
* Projected $73.7B in loan origination for 2022
   * $35.6B from personal loans, $13.6B from small and medium entrepreneur loans, and $24.5B from refinancing student debt
   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

To recap, MX is a 20+ year company that was the first in the market to start developing OLED DDIC (2003). Due to being the first in the market, they have had a lot of time to develop and have accumulated quality IP/Patents and processes for OLED DDIC. Their chips power the display in smartphones

OLEDs are booming:

A few last things... (if you get this innuendo, good job):

1. A Korean tech blog reported that the new iPhone 13 displays will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. It is said that they want

* OLED Screen
* 120hz HFR
* LPTO Displays

1. Hmm.. I wonder if Samsung has a relationship with a DDIC company that has the chips that provides/support all that? - [source](http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128)
2. OLED is here, gaming console usage could become a very large upside opportunity. The Nintendo Switch (upcoming) will have a OLED display (albeit a lower end one, called rigid OLED compared to ones in iPhones)

MX is poised to generate $60-$70mm in EBITDA in 2021, so at the $35 it is still quite reasonably valued. Would recommend buying at prices below $30 given there is still merger risk.

6/11/21 13:32,"WKHS - Buy the Rumor USPS One More Time? USPS $12 Billion !!! It is deju vu all over again. It is June and the horse is running just like it did 12 months ago when it went from penny stock to over $20 faster than Man O' War ever could run. Today we have a more mature company with over 8,000 trucks on back order and a drone unit that has tested succesufuly 45 out 45 times. That makes me think at $2 Billion which it trades at is already a value to its peers (NKLA $7 Billion Market Cap - Arrival $11 Billion - and Rivian rumored to IPO at $70 Billion).

The big honey pot, of course, was always the USPS deal which was shockingly given to Osh Kosh Defense in a deal that has drawn heavy scruntiy. If you read the press release closely, you notice that OSK has only been awarded $450 million of the deal so far and even more oddly it is a rendering of a truck that has never been tested. Qualified bidders all put vehicles through rigirous USPS testing in various terrain, climate and durabity in the finalist stage. USPS picked a rendering after a half decade of making companies go through all the hoops and ladders. There were three finalist. Workhorse Group, OSK, and Morgan Olson who was partnered with Turkish company Karsan who had a hybrid vehicle that was bypassed.

A month ago, Workhorse announced a partnership deal with a new subsidary of Olson called EAVX. During the earnings call the day of the announcement, Workhorse CEO Duane Hughes kept reffering to a ""Next Generation Delievery Vehicle"" the two companies were working together on but didn't expand much further on the product. It was intersting terminology as the USPS contract was for a ""Next Generation Delievery Vehicle"". Morgan Olson has been working on USPS trucks for four decades and took over Grumman who did the USPS trucks currently in use you see today.

Today it was announced that the infrastructure bill has been agreed to and in that bill there was an allotment for $12 Billion for USPS to transition to EVs. Were these two companies told to partner to come up with parts that then could be brought to OSK to do final assembly? Workhorse would provide the chassis, Olson would do the frame, and OSK would mesh the two together. It is definetly a possibilty.

OSK stated in their SEC filing in the fall that they were behind in EV development so could use a partner if USPS wants to transition to a full EV fleet now that the funds are available for them in this bill. It would also play well in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan (all battleground states) getting a piece of a giant government contract and employ thousands of workers in those battleground states.

**FEAR NOT AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT JINKOSOLAR**

Disclaimer: I am by no means a financial expert, this is not financial advice and I once looked for my headphones while listening to music with them.

First things first: What the fuck is a Jinko?

Only the biggest friggin Solarpanel manufacturer, that’s what. At this very moment they supply **THE** **WHOLE PLANET** (excluding Antarctica I think) with **TOP OF THE LINE SOLAR JUICE**. They are literally **milking** the sun.

Boring stuff first to get it over with? Sure

**1: Technical Analysis**

TA is like astrology for “”rational grownups”, it works until it doesn’t. Still we can deduce certain developments and in the end only need to trick the algos. So here is a picture

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5cwojf3sug471.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=978b4f6e2b8c382247dacf8b28c37546e57f22b1

What is this shit and what does it mean?

The top picture shows the most recent downtrend, **WHICH JUST GOT FUCKING BROKEN** and the, still valid older downtrend from mid last year. The top red line is the next target, which would be \~ 60$ or almost 50% above current shareprice. If this gets broken too there are clear skies ahead, which is always good for solar 🌻.

The second picture is the MACD, ~~which means Macdonalds~~, which basically means when the line moves from below the center to above the center it’s a bullish signal. Since this just seems to be occurring one could speculate that this will start a **MASSIVE BONKERS BULLRUN**.

The last picture is the RSI and I included it because it looks pretty.

Are you bored yet? It gets worse before it gets better.

**2: THE NUMBERS MASON WHAT DO THEY MEAN**

Just looking at numbers alone won’t give you a good indication if a stock is performing well, is undervalued yada yada. Nice boy that I am I compared some metrics between Jinko and competition for you, in Excel like the **fucking nerd I am**.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wzzipat5vg471.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0cd1c824df9c9ccb8a5aa9274381fba9533f5b

As you may have noticed, Jinko **ABSOLUTELY DESTROYS** those 2 other guys in sales but is a **LITTLE BITCH** when it comes to profits and market cap. Why is that, am I retarded for recommending this bullshit to you? *Maybe.*

Then again, a closer look to the expenses reveal that most of the sales-money goes to SG&A, which is just administrative overhang in a company, think of salespeople, the janitor, the low level support who watches stocks all day on their phone. Why do they have so much of these? **BECAUSE THEY ARE ON LITERALLY EVERY CONTINENT ON THE EARTH.** Seriously, look it up. Australia, Middle-East, Asia, Europe, Africe, both Americas. They have locations everywhere. And customers are pleased, I’ll tell you that.

You know who else expanded everywhere aggressively in their history? It starts with A and ends with 1 day delivery. The other problem is that Jinko relies heavily on materials for producing, especially silicone. I think you know that this shit is expensive right now. So what do they do? Like the **GIGACHADS** they are they are actively acquiring mining companies so they don’t have to pay stupid premiums.

https://preview.redd.it/izpet1cdvg471.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=066908e318a77a46a964cbb9a7326e7375321850

**THEY ARE VALUED AT NOT EVEN HALF THEIR SALES! YOU CAN'T FIND THIS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE SOLAR SECTOR**

**3: BULLCASE**

So what’s next for Jinko, why would the stock rise at all? I already talked about expansion and being independent from material producers. Let me tell you about something going on in the heart of europoor country, Germany.

Chances are high, that “Die Grünen”, which literally translates to “The Greens”, a german political party which is all about protecting the environment, will be elected into government this summer. There are laws in the making which would force every homeowner to install solar panels on their roofs. Why is this important for Jinko? There are virtually no solar panel manufacturers left in Germany since the big solar bust some years ago, so we are dependant on foreign goods on this one. And since Jinko has the best performing modules and already has a strong presence and network in Europe, they will get a big slice of that juicy cake.

Next let’s look at their products, the panels themselves. **AT THIS VERY MOMENT** you can buy the world’s #7 panel from Jinko regarding efficiency at 20,2% for 0,76$ / W. Compare that to #1, which has a measily 2,2% more efficiency for DOUBLE the price. Are they stupid? That’s not all though, Jinko recently achieved a whopping 25,25% efficiency on their upcoming product line. You heard that right, we can soon suck off daddy sun for 1/4th of his output **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**.

Let’s not forget sleepy joe on this one. He promised a fat green deal. I bet my left asscheeck that solar will be included.

They recently appointed a new CFO, who himself has an extensive record in the solar industry. He worked at Canadian Solar (which is also a good stock to look at). They did that to prepare for the STAR listing which is basically the NYSE in Shanghai. Chinese people have very limited access to the stock markets, now they can get in on this beautiful dragon.

**4: BEARCASE**

I am not here to deceive you precious donkeys. No DD is complete without looking at the dark side.

There is obviously the **CHYNA** Factor at play here. Go watch “The China Hustle” if you want to know why Wallstreet is shy when it comes to Chinese stocks. It doesn’t really apply to Jinko since they are not just a doghouse in the middle of nowhere valued at millions, but psychology is a bitch. Also, trade wars, cold wars, hot wars, world of warcraft is all on the table. What troublesome times we live in.

Next is the issue with slave labour. There are concerns that parts of the materials used are extracted in regions where the Uyghurs are abused and mistreated and possibly used as modern slaves. I am not there and can neither verify or deny those claims but its good to keep in mind.

Also stock market doing stock market things. You never know.

**5: SAY THE LINE BART**

I am hesitant to use it, but it is what it is. Guess who is short on the biggest, badassest Solarpanelmanufacturer on the planet? Our favourite hedgeguy.

YFW you find out who is messing around again

I hope I didn’t bore you to death. I don't want this to be the next P&D. In my opinion there is just gigantic upside which has so far been overlooked by the """"efficient Market"""". Make your own choice.

TL;DR: At current cap, this stock is fucking undervalued and the market begins to notice. Have some rockets.

6/16/21 03:31,"$DKNG DRAFT KINGS ARE FOR THE APES 🎩🦍 I'm long the stock lesgoooo DraftKings Inc. fell the most since March on Tuesday after short seller Hindenburg Research said it was betting against the online gambling company.
Boston-based DraftKings -- which went public via a reverse merger in April 2020 -- plunged as much as 12% Tuesday to $44.65 after the report, its biggest drop since March 5. The stock trimmed losses to 4.5%, trading at $48.39 at 11 a.m. in New York.
...
Hindenburg disclosed a short position against the stock, meaning it will benefit from any drops in the shares. The short seller has recently waged other critiques against Lordstown Motors Corp. and Nikola Corp., which contributed to heavy losses on the stocks.

“This report is written by someone who is short on DraftKings stock with an incentive to drive down the share price,” the company said in a statement.

DraftKings shares have slipped from a March record
The Hindenburg report on DraftKings focused on the company’s technology platform subsidiary SBTech, as well as profits made by insiders who have cashed in on the stock’s surge from its deal announcement. DraftKings had soared nearly 400% from December 2019 when the company announced its three-way deal to go public alongside SBTech through Monday’s close.

DraftKings said it conducted a thorough review of SBTech’s business practices and that it was “comfortable with the findings” before the deal was completed in 2020.

Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken defended DraftKings in a note, saying investors should use the stock’s drop as an opportunity ahead of potential gambling legalization in Canada and in New York. The analyst rates the stock ‘outperform’, with a price target at $85.

Broad Declines
Weakness for sports betting companies went beyond DraftKings as the Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming exchange-traded fund (BETZ), a sports betting and iGaming ETF, dipped as much as 2.5%. Flutter Entertainment Plc., which owns DraftKings’ rival FanDuel, fell as much as 5.5% in London.


DraftKings shares have stumbled over recent months amid a dearth of top sporting events and a broader slide for high-flying companies. The company is one of a slew of startups that have gone public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies.

The gaming company has yet to turn a profit and is not expected to post positive earnings until 2026, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

However, Wall Street analysts are broadly positive on the company with 20 rating shares a buy and eight having hold-equivalents. None rate it a sell and the average 12-month price target of $70 implies shares will rise 49% over the coming year.

Short Risks
Short sellers are increasingly facing pushback on trading platforms and social media, where retail traders publicly challenge investors who stand to profit from a company’s woes.

Trading in so-called meme stocks has remained hot since the start of the year after Reddit users rallied behind video game retailer GameStop Corp. after investors including Citron Capital’s Andrew Left and Gabriel Plotkin’s Melvin Capital announced bets against the company.

Left said the money manager covered most of its short bets against GameStop at a loss of 100% in late January and later said his firm would discontinue offering short-sell analysis.

Roughly one-tenth of DraftKings shares available for trading are currently sold short, according to data compiled by S3 Partners. That compares to a February low of 5.2%.

6/16/21 00:50,"EXCUSE ME SIR, THIS IS A CASINO. YOU DO NOT F WITH MY CASINO $DKNG Hindenburg Research, an investment research firm with a focus in activist short-selling which also publishes reports on alleged fraud by other companies, has chosen DraftKings (DKNG) as its next target. Shares are down around 7% in pre-market after Hindenburg announced that it would be taking a short position on the American sports betting operator. DraftKings was not immediately available for comment.

In its report titled “DraftKings: A $21 Billion SPAC Betting It Can Hide Its Black Market Operations,” published this morning, Hindenburg describes the company as having experienced “one of the more successful deals in a recent wave of SPAC transactions marred by scandal and bad actors.”

DraftKings, which went public in early 2020 after a merger between DraftKings, its SPAC, and SBTech, a gaming technology company based in Bulgaria, has since experienced gains in its share price of around 400%.

“Unbeknownst to investors, DraftKings’ merger with SBTech also brings exposure to extensive dealings in black-market gaming, money laundering and organized crime,” the report read. “Based on conversations with multiple former employees, a review of SEC & international filings, and inspection of back-end infrastructure at illicit international gaming websites, we show that SBTech has a long and ongoing record of operating in black markets.”

According to the report, Hindenburg estimates that approximately 50% of SBTech’s revenue is generated from markets in which gambling is outlawed, citing DraftKings’ SEC filings, correspondence with former employees, and other supporting documents.

The report then goes on to cover the operations of BTi/CoreTech, which Hindenburg describes as a “distributor entity” with around 50 employees which SBTech uses to “distance itself from its black-market dealings.”

“Illicit customer relationships were shuffled into a newly formed ‘distributor’ entity called BTi/CoreTech, with ~50 SBTech employees shifted across town to the new entity,” the report read.

**Past targets of Hindenburg include Nikola (NKLA), Chinese firm Ebang (EBON), Clover Health (CLOV), and Loop Industries (LOOP).**

* Someone is avoiding overnight gap risk because they are

   * short a large number of calls
* Dealers are hedging greeks at the close and don't care about quality order fills

6/17/21 08:45,"I think after I'm done with donkey Kong's $DKNG IMA PUT IT ALL INTO TESLA lmk what u think Shares of Tesla closed lower despite a strong call from Mizuho.

Analysts at the firm reiterated their buy rating on the stock, citing the company's leadership in the global electric vehicle market and expecting the stock to get a boost from the Biden administration's proposed infrastructure plan. 


Michael Bapis, managing director of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management, told CNBC on Tuesday that Tesla's roughly 24% market share and ambitions in the electric vehicle, space and clean energy markets make it a name worth watching.

""Tesla is going to continue to be the leader in the industry, especially for the foreseeable future,"" Bapis said on ""Trading Nation."" ""When you think Tesla, you think innovation.""

He expects the company to keep delivering strong sales and earnings growth, which he said could raise demand for the stock.

""If you look at some of these institutional funds ... and they don't have this stock in there, they're definitely going to get questioned why,"" he said.

Although Tesla did run up ""too far, too fast"" last year as people piled into the stock, Bapis said now is a great time to buy the dip.


""Unless someone comes in and breaks through the difficult barriers to entry, you're going to see this stock grow long term,"" he said. ""Any time you get the chance to buy it, buy it.""

He added that although its supply chain has been riddled with delays and shortages, Tesla was a strong long-term buy considering its fundamentals and growth potential. 

""I think it's the time to buy it right now and just put it away,"" he said. ""Close your eyes on the volatility for a little bit and bet on the fundamentals and the leadership of the company. I mean, you can't get a better leader than they have.""

In the same ""Trading Nation"" interview, Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, noted that Tesla's stock has been relatively flat for the past several months, trading around its 200-day moving average.

infographic
""You don't see that very often,"" he said. ""Whichever way it breaks away from that 200-day moving average will give us a little bit of a hint [about] its next move.""

The stock is also forming a descending triangle pattern, Maley said, saying the upper end of the pattern is around $650 and the lower end sits at $563. Those are the two levels to watch, and where shares move relative to those levels will be very indicative of where Tesla is headed, he said.

""In the past, when the stock has been stuck in this sideways range, once it breaks out, it starts to move in a big way. This should be no different,"" he said.

Tesla's deliveries report in the first week of July could be a breakout catalyst, Maley said.

Disclosure: Bapis's family and Vios Advisors own shares of Tesla.

In this post, I will discuss the following: what is Hidenburg Research, who is their CEO, Nathan dick-fuck Anderson, then I'll breakdown the Hidenburg Fud article about DKNG. Their evaluation of DKNG. The connection between DKNG, SBTech and the illegal sportsbook market. Lastly, why Hidenburg wrote this article. And of course- there’s a tl;dr at the bottom. Let’s fucking go nerds.

Hindenburg Research does exactly what a lot of us do here, they construct DD's and release them onto the public hoping that others will join in on their idea and together make a lot of money. As of lately they've been kind of right, ex: Nikola (was trash we all knew it), Kandi (again trash), Lordstrom Motors (debatable), Clover too (but this one was a flop). Anyway, so HR (Hindenburg Research) looks for heavily  invested-retail stocks, with heavy-bull $$$$, they enter these massive short positions and then they construct these intricate DDs called ""investigations"" on why you should short with them, then the next day, the stock will drill, HR will take profits and the stock either flops or goes back to business in a few months. The big difference maker between our DDs and their DDs is they have fucking money to distribute their idea. I think they were right about the previous companies, but they're definitely stretching with DKNG.

You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/a38lsw/hindenburg_research_listed_in_pump_and_dump_court/). Essentially, Anderson was releasing fake sources and articles through an alias of a company that was linked to [HR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSLimited/comments/lthtry/i_did_investigation_for_hindenburg_report_issuers/) Promoting their idea and trying to profit off false information.

Not sure how accurate this is, but supposedly, he's currently being investigated by the SEC for Misconduct. I guess their website keeps getting taken down by the SEC for investigation. To conclude, Nathan Anderson, is an absolute corporate, pump and dump, shill artist. He doesn't like WSB as you can tell from his tweets and he thinks he's God's gift to drop and article and just instantly make money, regardless of whether it's valid or not. Fuck that Dickhead. This guy, his tweets, his actions should be enough alone to fight against this guy and any company he shorts.

**THE ARTICLE**

The article is absolute trash, if you haven't seen it yet- [here it is](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/).

There's basically two key arguments. The first, DraftKings is tied to illegal revenue streams (poor sources). Second, DraftKings is overvalued (with some weak fundamentals) So I will be discussing these two arguments and talking about why they're dead ass wrong and/or just plain don't matter.

Before we go in, please watch this CNBC segment from yesterday morning. They explain it very well. TL;DR, SBtech has little to no value for DKNG.  [https://streamable.com/ng95ed](https://streamable.com/ng95ed)

**SBTECH - ""the illegal revenue stream""**

SbTech may or may not have been involved in some shady business altercation back in 2014-2017. You can be the judge of that, but I can assure you that as of the DKNG acquisition, they are most likely clean.

What is [SBTech?](https://www.sbtech.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/tz910a0xum571.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=46213501992f1d2b9a2a4ee67a015eb6a5bc9231

Essentially, SBTech creates the platforms for sportbooks. They are the data analytics. They don't own psychical sportsbooks, rather they create the software for websites to lease out and use for their own branding. HR believe's that SBTech has been leasing their software to illegal sportsbooks in Asian via  a pseudo company, BTI company (kind of ironic right, the man who used pseudo accounts to spew false information- is now accusing another company of using a pseudo name), all because of their locality (their offices are close - they offer a picture of google maps to show this lmao??), they have similar source code (they literally went into google chrome and inspected their website code, you can find similar script comparing source code for ANY website) and their CEO (BTI Company) is friends with the founder of SBTech (people who are in similar business tend to work together). But the factor of the matter is, a quick google search from [Bit Core Tech](http://bitcoretech.com/), and SBTech can tell you that the two companies are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Lastly, they use hypothetical sources, stating that they talked to prior employees of SBTech, saying everything they do is illegal, are you actually going to trust a Hedgie who's manipulated information before, I Know I'm not. Regardless, does it even matter?

[Source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/39376/sbtech-oregon-sports-betting-contract/)

What's kind of crazy, is that they (SBTech) have an exclusive deal with the state of Oregon, yet HR thinks that their research team is able to do a better investigation than the state of Oregon, and the Department of Justice.  Not only that, the laws associated with establishing a mobile sports gambling license are insane, to think that state and federal investigations weren't able to find any illegal activity is down right laughable.

They estimate that roughly half of SBTech's 2020 revenue came from unregulated markets, and about 10% of DKNG's B2B revenue comes from SBTech, so what does that mean? That mean's they're creating fud, this is funny, just wait. Let's say that hypothetically speaking they're right, and DKNG is committing to fraudulent revenue streams, how does this affect their current revenue?

[B2B revenue = $31,429,000 \(SBTech accounts for 10&#37;\) = $3,142,900 total revenue to DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/6hm3rhjbvm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=b96263e1539518c0aaa7d08178051e52989815b2)

Yeah, so worst case scenario, HR is right and DKNG has to remove SbTech from their revenue, damn. Looks like they lost a whopping \~1% of their current revenue stream. Not a massive hit considering they only have access to 25% of the current U.S. Population.

[Bullet point 2 - 25&#37; of U.S. Population](https://preview.redd.it/fzn2q88fvm571.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=2513a920a090df8dc4f21da061fb65b5be5dbbc9)

Another big point for HR was that insiders were selling. Who the fuck cares- when has insider selling ever been a clear bearish since, news flash , it hasn't. You don't even know what they're doing with that money. They could be investing BACK into the company for all well know. Plus, this back tests back to JUNE of 2020, literally a few months after they dropped the SPAC. Who knows if any of these sales are due to SPAC merger. What's way more important is institutional purchases

**Closing Statement - Who are you going to trust, a DKNG Investor, User, and Lover, me (and Queen Cathie Woods) or Nathan Anderson the CEO of Hindenburg Research, your corporate crook on steroids, he brags about being better than you're average retail investor/wsb'r on his private twitter, he's been charged in a previous pump and dump scheme for spreading false information under a pseudo name and he may or may not be currently under the investigation by the SEC. His current allegation against DKNG is just another one of his pump and dump's off fake news. DKNG is undervalued, his false accusations of illegal revenue are irrelevant, SBTech only accounts for 1% of DKNG's** ***current*** **total revenue.

IMO Burns was targeted because of his relationship with the prior administration. Yes, he might have been awful, but given different circumstances, we may not have known, different pressures and all... 

IMO this sets the stage for Workhorse and Lordstown motors to be the media’s new darling.  

Tim Ryan, the congressman from Ohio and a favorite to win the Senate seat, said WKHS was on the cusp of winning the USPS contract, then surprise, it goes to Oshkosh. But now, DeJoy looks to be heading the way of Burns and the contract award to Oshkosh continues to raise eyebrows. 

Today it was made clear the Lordstown plant is tooled to build the Endurance and they’re on schedule to hit limited production this year. The other important point is the Endurance and the WKHS USPS NGDV are built on the same platform. This was the plan all along. 

Final point. The USPS needed new vehicles 15 years ago. If they’re going electric where are they going to get them anytime soon..

Yes.


Was the air conditioning working?

Was it clean?

No.


Was the popcorn good?

No.


Was the Coke good?

NO BECAUSE THE SELL TRASH ASS PEPSI NOW.


According to every study ever done, Coke is more popular than Pepsi in the US. According to the same study, Coke has a more loyal fan base. I can deal with bad popcorn or a warm room, BUT WHO TF WANT A BLUE PEPSI CUP WHEN THEY'RE AT A MOVIE?!?!

Even my one friend who likes Pepsi admits that there's something wrong with having Pepsi at a movie theater. 

At the moment I saw the Pepsi sign I knew I was never going back to a Regal theater and will only go to the AMC further away from my house. Many more people will do the same. 


TLDR: Regal owns stock in AMC, so they started selling Pepsi so more people would go to AMC, increasing revenue, and boosting the stock price.",49666,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.877704144,True

BABA is the leader in the transition to cloud (47% in 2019 according to Canalys). BABA is the inversed Amazon in terms of profitability. BABA makes money from their retail platform, doesn't get into the weeds, and is currently sacrificing profitability for market share in cloud.

Furthermore, BABA has stakes in a wide range of logistics and consumer service companies. Even after appropriately discounting ADR and BABA being a Chinese company, to me it's criminally undervalued trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO while having clear future growth. Would love to hear how BABA deserves this low multiple.

6/18/21 03:41,"$MX DD - A Buyout Value Play Analysis **TL;DR for the lazy: Institutions and shareholders alike place a price target for $MX at $30 or higher that they have shown they are willing to actually execute at. Regardless of successful buyout, $MX is highly undervalued at its current ~$23.25 price point.** 

**What is $MX?**

Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation is an odd company that is incorporated in Delaware, is headquartered in Luxembourg, and operates almost entirely in South Korea designing and manufacturing analog, mixed signal, and digital semiconductors. Among its various product offerings, Magnachip most notably controls the second largest market share globally for OLED display driver integrated circuits, preceded only by Samsung. Recently, their stock has seen a lot of up and down movement due to a combination of multiple potential buyout offers, shareholder litigation, and federal regulatory interference that, given the following information, presents a clear buy opportunity at the current price point.  

Note: This post won't be covering any financials or other fundamentals regarding the company, simply the details regarding the company's merger status and effective price implications. 

**1st Buyout Offer - Wise Road**

Back on May 25th, [Magnachip confirmed the details of a merger agreement with South Dearborn Ltd](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/40589cb3-9433-4d68-af2c-62e1c76af403)., a sub-corporation for a Chinese private equity fund Wise Road Ltd. with a track record of acquisitions in the semiconductor manufacturing industry in Asia, for a buyout offer proposing the acquisition of all outstanding shares at a price of $29 per share. This led to an overnight increase in share price from the low $20s range to ~$25. It would continue to trade in this range with a slow decline to around $23 until this past Friday, June 11th when [a second unsolicited buy offer came through from Cornucopia Capital Ltd](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/af010acc-8ffb-4482-b8a6-aa02436ee7d1#page=11&zoom=100,21,9) on behalf of another group of Chinese investors. This **unsolicited** offer was significant due to the fact that the initial merger agreement with Wise Road included a ""No Solicitation"" provision that restricted Magnachip from attempting to directly solicit any competing offers that might have pressured Wise Road to raise their initial purchase price. 

**2nd Buyout Offer - Cornucopia**

This second buyout offer came with a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of $MX at **$35 per share** compared to Wise Road's $29 per share offer. However, Magnachip was already quite far along in its deal with Wise Road and had plans to gather shareholder votes by June 14th to approve/deny the acquisition, and announce the results and further details of the acquisition at a virtual shareholder conference on June 15th. This bid from Cornucopia led to Magnachip delaying the shareholder conference until June 17th while Magnachip's board and legal team reviewed the new potential deal with Cornucopia with a deadline of 5:00 P.M. June 16th. Which was yesterday, meaning there's going to be a press release in the immediate future.  

**US CFIUS Review**

On May 26th, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) requested that Magnachip and Wise Road submit a notice for a formal review of the merger, which both parties complied with and filed on June 11th. Now, Magnachip itself has released statements in their SEC filings stating that they **do not** believe that there should be any approvals required for the merger in the US, for the following reasons as quoted from their filing: 

> ""All manufacturing and research and development activities take place in South Korea, and substantially all sales activities take place in South Korea, with the remainder of sales operations located in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and Germany. Substantially all of the employees are based in South Korea and employed by Magnachip Semiconductor, Ltd., the Korean operating company; and the remainder of the employees are located outside the United States. There are no tangible assets or IT systems located in the United States, and all intellectual property is owned by Magnachip South Korea or, to a very limited degree, other non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company""

[Source](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/8117620b-c4f2-485b-b80e-c9cadbdfec88)

On June 16th, the CFIUS imposed an ""Order Establishing Interim Mitigation Measures"", ordering Magnachip and Wise Road to completely halt all further progress/discussion on the merger until their review was approved. As a result, Magnachip further delayed its shareholder meeting intended for June 17th to a currently unspecified future date. This led to the spike downward to today's price as shareholder confidence in the merger fell. 

The primary concern on behalf of the CFIUS is the sale of advanced proprietary semiconductor manufacturing tech to a competing nation in China while both nations have recently committed heavily to increased investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. However, Magnachip's manufacturing, R&D, and sales are all based out of South Korea, [with China already accounting for over 50% of their sales in 2020 while U.S. sales composed only 1%](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/company/). In addition to the reasons stated by Magnachip, it seems further unlikely that the U.S. would risk further aggravating US-China relations over a company that 

* does not even command a $2B market cap
* barely conducts any business within the United States
* conducts over 90% of its sales across Asia 
* does not contribute to *domestic* semiconductor manufacturing goals  
* [has over 80% institutional ownership of available float](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mx/institutional-holdings) (i.e. investors that hate losing money, would vote yes for guaranteed profit in a heartbeat, and wield significant political power in the financial sector)  

But most importantly, the U.S. does not compete and has not shown any indication of competing in the future in the specific market in which $MX currently holds its most distinct competitive lead - its OLED DDIC technology, most commonly adopted for modern smartphone displays.

**South Korea Regulation**

The United States isn't the only entity that $MX requires the okay from to proceed with the merger. South Korea has a list of technologies that it classifies as ""national core technologies"", or technologies that require regulatory approval in cases such as this where a company that produces such technology is being sold to foreign investors. Originally, industry insiders in Korea believed that this would not apply to $MX, as $MX's OLED semiconductor technology did not fall under this classification and China already possesses relatively high level OLED and semiconductor manufacturing technology. However, it was [recently confirmed that as of June 9th](https://view.asiae.co.kr/article/2021060917303625530), South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy has registered OLED DDIC semiconductor technology as part of their national core technologies, which confirmed that $MX would be required to undergo review on the Korean side as well in order for any foreign acquisition attempts to proceed. 

[Magnachip SEC filing from June 17th regarding aforementioned Korean regulatory review.](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/d7f8ba0b-1d32-48e3-86c3-d5c0a6731bfd) 

The reason for the rushed regulatory attempt from the South Korean government can be traced back to 2002, when Hydis, an liquid crystal display-focused spinoff from Hynix Semiconductor, was sold to China's Jingdongfang. At the time, Korea was the dominant world leader in liquid crystal display semiconductor production. But after the acquisition of Hydis, Jingdongfang began its own production within a year and is today the world's largest producer of liquid crystal displays. Seeking to avoid a repeat of this scenario, Korean citizens petitioned the government to intervene on the deal. 

Currently, it is being speculated on the side of the Korean media that the decision of the CFIUS's review will likely be the final deciding factor for the South Korean government's decision on the matter and the national core technology classification served to appease citizens and establish precedence for regulatory precedence for future international dealings involving OLED technology.

**Shareholder Litigation** 

Magnachip is also currently involved with multiple litigation claims from individual shareholders claiming that Magnachip failed to carry out its fiduciary duty in negotiating the deal with Wise Road. The shareholders that brought forth the suit believe that the $29 per share acquisition deal **undervalues** their shares and that Magnachip did not perform its duty in negotiating a fair price for the buyout on behalf of public shareholders, one of whom stated the following:

> ""First, the compensation afforded under the Proposed Transaction to Company
> stockholders significantly undervalues the Company. The proposed valuation does not adequately
> reflect the intrinsic value of the Company. Moreover, the valuation does not adequately take into
> consideration how the Company is performing and its promise.""

[Source - read from point 44 (page 12) onwards to see why $MX is undervalued EVEN WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE BUYOUT OFFERS.](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.558913/gov.uscourts.nysd.558913.1.0.pdf) AKA the stuff I would have included if this was a normal DD. 

Essentially, this states that if the company executives weren't so greedy on securing a deal that gets them a fat bonus, they could've easily negotiated a deal that reallocates more of that value into a greater than $29 per share buyout. **Shareholders are literally suing Magnachip because they believe the stock is worth significantly more than $29.**  Yeah, if that's not bullish, I don't know what is.

**Price Action Analysis**

Due to a relatively low average daily trading volume, the stock price tends to jump quite a bit in a short period of time when positive/negative news comes out. As of time of posting, $MX is trading at around $23.25 - a significant drop from the $25.50-$26 range it traded at just a few days before. We've seen that ever since the announcement of the initial buy out offer in late March, $MX has seen a strong price floor at $23. And given that basically all of the negative news that could possibly have come out has already come out, I believe that the downward pressure is now or soon to be fully priced in, leaving a significantly favored upside compared to downside from here on out. 

Additionally, **regardless of whether either deal with Wise Road or Cornucopia goes through or not**, these two buy offers have shown that there are large professional investment institutions out there that value $MX at a price of $29 **minimum**, a sentiment seemingly aggressively shared by shareholders as well. The above, along with the recent drop in price attributed to the unease surrounding by the CFIUS Interim Order, present what I believe to be a great buy opportunity when looking at a medium to long term reversal with a huge potential catalyst in the short-term as well. 

And even if these two buy offers fall through, would shareholders ever vote to approve a buy offer for LESS than $29 in the future after all of this? Not a fucking chance.


**Conclusion**

Might be boring, but I'd go shares over calls here for this play. If your *personal risk tolerance* is on the higher side and shares are for boomers, I'd go for calls at the 25 or 30 strike at least a few months out. If a buyout is confirmed, calls are printing infinite. If not, then they still have a solid chance of going ITM assuming a decently far out expiry. 

Do note that at the current trading volume, options can be fairly illiquid. 

Positions - 250 shares at ~$24 each and 5x 30c 9/17 for fun. 

This is my first DD so go easy on me. I'd love to hear some discussion about any points I may not have thought of or covered.",49926,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.760210872,True

Presumably, many of you are aware of the WKHS news that was dropped yesterday. If you are not, here is a slight briefing:

Pretty much a 6 billion dollar contract to replace our USPS vehicles was awarded to a company, Oshkosh, that didn't provide an Electric Vehicle Model. Congress stated, the fleet must be 75% electric, and after the contract was awarded, only 10% was said to be electric after conversion from I.C.E. There was a suspicious block purchase of Oshkosh stock the day prior to the contract announced awarding Oshkosh the deal. WKHS has now filed a legal challenge officially. Oh, and did I mention the SI is over 50% in WKHS, and the market cap is 1.7 Billion.

6/26/21 07:23,"Did you Drink the Meme Stonk Kool-Aid? Time to wash it down with some good ol’ (K)entucky (H)ighed (C)hicken and let the tendies start busting in like the Kool-Aid Man. I’m getting really tired of people and media talking about “drinking the meme stock Kool-Aid”, like YES BOOMER, I sure fuckin’ did and I will do it again, damnit! Who tf doesn’t like Kool-Aid? 

That got me thinking about investing in actual Kool-Aid.

1. Kids love this shit. Drink it, dye their hair with it, whatever. Doesn’t matter. This is a fundamental beverage to the experience of American childhood. 
2. Jonestown. Did you know it wasn’t even Kool-Aid used at this massacre? It was Flavor Aid which is basically the 1978 equivalent of ordering Kool-Aid from WISH.
3. The mascot be busting through some walls and I could really use some of that BDE in my portfolio. 
4. Purple is a flavor and this is proven by both Kool-Aid and those frozen ice pops that slice the sides of your face up like they’re trying to turn you into The Joker.

With my Kool-Aid thesis in hand, I trace this shit back to the parent company and start getting excited. We got ketchup, mac n cheese, fancy fucking mustard, cream cheese, and a commitment to ecologically friendly practices by 2025. IS THERE EVEN A DOWNSIDE TO THIS COMPANY? 

Yes, in the interest of fair and balanced research, there is and I believe the biggest danger to this company’s growth is that unpronounceable condiment Worcestershire sauce, and fish. I know damn well this sauce is like the dark magic cooking secret and it’s fundamental when you have to trick a date into thinking you can cook but the problem lies in the useless ingredient that substantially ups the cost production while excluding a growing market of vegetarians. Lea & Perrins has brand name recognition but they insist on including anchovies in all their recipes. This is dumb and literally useless. An off brand with all the same ingredients except the anchovies tastes exactly the same and is friendly to vegetarians as well as folks who just think it’s weird to put fish gratuitously in things. The only reason it’s even still in there is tradition because it was supposed to be a fish sauce and *failed*. Essentially they are paying tribute to an idea that didn’t turn out to be relevant at all. I don’t believe the company will address this huge blunder and is likely to bleed profits from this particular weak point until it is addressed. BUT, I still believe my Kool-Aid thesis benefits outweigh this one fixable downside and so I will elaborate on each of the four benefits listed above. Kids love this shit. Teens love this shit. Gamers who can’t afford Mountain Dew so they have to mix a drink in the empty bottle love this shit. Grandmas love this shit. Nobody is going to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Which leads to point two. How do we absolutely know that nobody is going to stop drinking this wonderful beverage where every flavor is better described as a color? Jonestown is how, beeches. This drink company survived one of the worse PR nightmares in all of history and kept right on chugging for *forty plus* more years. In case you don’t know, the Jonestown massacre was when a crazy cult dude convinced all his followers to drink poison. It was horrifying in every possible way. The method of delivery for this poison cocktail was Flavor Aid, a cheap off brand competitor. From a PR perspective this is doubly awful because Kool Aid was completely innocent but you can’t exactly call up the newspaper and be like “Hey buddy, I know this is a fucking terrible tragedy but could you please release a statement saying it wasn’t us they used and was actually a competitor?” Because how fucking petty is that shit. Makes you look awful even though you, nor your competitor, had anything at all to do with it. If Kool-Aid can survive that, what can’t they survive??? 

That brings us to the Kool-Aid Man. I like the cut of his jib, just busting through walls all wildly-nilly whenever he pleases. This anthropomorphic asshole is definitely going to drive up costs on building materials like steel and lumber and I’m long on CLF because that CEO spouted off on short sellers 2 years ago. Never mind that I only saw the video 2 weeks ago, I’m long on it now. Bring me some tendies, ohhhhhhh yeaaaaahhhhhhh. 

My last point is flavor profile. Purple is a flavor. Blue is a flavor. Green is a flavor. We’re hold these truths to be self-evident. Purple doesn’t taste like a grape, I’ve had a lot of grapes and nothing about them tastes like purple. Blue “raspberry”? Fuck you, I’ve seen a lot of raspberries and you know what color they aren’t? BLUE. Because blue IS the flavor. I’m tired of this myth being perpetuated that these color flavors have any resemblance to fruit. They don’t. I’m long on purple and blue because those are the best. Red can go fuck itself, puts on that shit. TLDR; I drank the metaphorical Kool-Aid so I might as well invest in the actual makers of Kool-Aid.",49999,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998693526,True

In doing so, Nedeljkovic emphasized that the company wants to reduce production costs per vehicle by 25 percent by the middle of this decade - compared to the level of two years ago.

**25% DECREASE IN PRODUCTION COST**

""Among other things, the introduction of software for better planning of production processes should lead to a reduction in cost price,"" Nedeljkovic argued.

6/24/21 12:29,"NKLA to $0.00. Or the Moon. IDK Howdy y’all, welcome to a bad DD post, but first! Let me get my butt covered really quick… I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you continue to read, you will lose money whether you agree or disagree with this DD. This is all satire and I’m making everything up. Upon writing this, I have had enough drinks to consider texting all my exes at the same time, especially the weird one.

Let’s talk about Nikola, shall we? Other than being a bargain-bin Tesla knockoff, they’re also one of the worst publicly traded companies to ever exist, including Theranos, Enron, and Worldcom. Basically, go watch Patrick Boyle’s video on them and see all the sketchy things they’ve done to pretend to be a real vehicle/tech company. However, instead of taking a nose dive into the ground, they have climbed up to $18.00 per share from their low of like $9.50 a few months back after their crash from $75. So, what’s going on here? Is it time to but puts or calls? If you look at my post history, I am great at losing money on these kinds of questions.

The fundamentals:

Disclaimer: For the purpose of this analysis, the environment doesn’t matter. Sorry, but business is business. I hope for sustainable practices and want the world to be a cleaner and sustainable place, but that’s currently not a line-item on the income statement.

Let’s look at the financials. Nikola has less revenue than the average ice cream truck. They’re currently all sitting on the edge of their seats to see if they’ll even be able to make a real vehicle that doesn’t have to be rolled down a hill. And they’re burning poopy tons of money doing this. At the end of 2020, they had about $900,000,000 in the bank. That’s a lot of money, but how fast do they burn their Benjamins? According to their cash flow statement, they outflowed about $240,000,000 from Operating and Investing activities. Looking at their growth rate from 2018-2020, I’m ballparking a 75% increase in operating negative cash flow expenses year-over-year, but indeterminant investing activity cash flows. Remember, they want to build a bunch of charging stations around the county because their trucks will only use their proprietary charging system. I have no idea what that would cost to put these stations around the USA, but I’m imagining it’s not written with 9 digits. I don’t think they’re going to be able to afford the infrastructure or even make a viable product work before they run out of money. Between the large capital expenditures required, the quick burn rate of cash, and the necessity to either leverage up with debt or issue more shares for money, I don’t like the fundamentals for this company surviving. Cathy Wood also doesn’t like it.

Now let’s look the team: Trevor Milton is gone. This is bullish because he’s a fart-monger. If I had to guess, this is why the stock price has rebounded a little over the last few months. I can’t find much on their new CEO Mark Russell, who picked up the gig from just being their President, so I’m going to assume he’s also pretty sus because he was around when all the sketchy stuff went down. I’m probably wrong though, so he might turn this ship around. I’m not seeing anything significant on anyone else in the company, so I’m guessing they’re irrelevant. Bearish.

And that’s the problem: What if it doesn’t just go to $0.00 like it should? What if an army of retards decide that this dumpster fire is the next moonshot? I don’t know those answers, but I’m willing to take the risk and lose some money to find out if I’m right or wrong. So how about the part everyone cares about?

Puts or calls? This company doesn’t belong on Wall Street. It belong on Shark Tank with a unanimous “I’m out.” However, I know I’m retarded and terrible at doing stock analysis. There’s only like 4 numbers in my financial analysis, so it’s gotta be bad. Therefore I’m going to outsmart myself by buying some $20 Jan 2022 calls and get some some $10 Jan 2023 puts . It’s either going up a lot or down a lot. Or I’m just wrong, it just stays at $18, and I move into a nice tent under the bridge. Now if you’ll excuse me, my next appointment is waking up on my kitchen floor a few hours after my shift starts. Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀. Even though I’m thinking down.

Edit: my position is in the reply to the mod comment. Exit plan: close call at 100% profit or Close put when the company delists.

Edit 2: I put my brain to use and realized the big premium on my calls pretty much erases any potential gains on my puts, so I’ll be looking to roll those into a cheaper and closer expiry if I can, like 1-2 months out rather than 7. These options are also pretty illiquid, so I may have just painted myself into a corner on this one.

Update: rolled the call down to the October $19 call for $360. Also made $1 on closing the Jan call lol. That’s 1/2 of a McMuffin right there!",50251,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.996499658,True

6/24/21 02:12,"$WISH...The App and the Products... Why WISH is a ""shitty app""? Well...it´s on purpose.

""In June 2007, Szulczewski transferred to Google’s new office in South Korea and got a lesson in tech outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Koreans preferred search portals that were busy and crowded with information over clean, minimalist home pages like Google’s. Former Google colleague Mark Rabkin remembers debating the point with Szulczewski when he visited. “I could tell he was starting to think like a local,” says Rabkin, who’s now an ad executive at Facebook. The experience would help shape Szulczewski’s strategy for Wish: He learned to focus on building something people wanted rather than what Silicon Valley thought they should want.""  


Does WISH sell shitty products?  


""Wish’s open-door policy meant that sales were taking off, but so were quality-control problems—which is somewhat inevitable when you have one million registered merchants, of whom 125,000 are active on Wish each month. By way of context, Amazon hosts an estimated 2.5 million active third-party merchants, while Walmart has roughly 21,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a New York-based e-commerce intelligence firm.  

To tackle this, Wish automatically culls about 8 million products over a week, or close to 3% of all products available on the site. Most are cut because visitors have scrolled past an item at least 1,000 times and haven’t tapped on it once. Wish also culls products from merchants who’ve received bad reviews or put up fake reviews. To automatically detect the fakes, Wish’s engineers trained its software on reviews that were obviously made up. One example: “Did not expect so soon, the owner of service enthusiasm.” Now the software can identify reviews with similar nonsensical phrases.

Szulczewski seems unfazed by the quality-control challenge, pointing out that sometimes customers themselves are the problems.""We sell 5 million contact lenses a year. Someone's going to sleep in them.""Overall, there is a set of roughly 60 rules. If Wish’s algorithms see that a merchant has listed counterfeit products or shipped an order with a fake tracking number, they’ll be “fined” $500. Shipping a package with no product spells a potential $10,000 fine. Wish collects around $3 million a month in fines, and it can do that by simply withholding payments from merchants, says Szulczewski. Merchants can also get kicked off the platform, he adds. On the flip side, good reviews can lead to faster payments or a higher ranking in search. 

Zhang, who is 6,000 miles away, overseeing operations in three locations in China with 150 staff members, is just as paranoid about being gamed. “Merchants definitely care about making money first,” Zhang says. The rules and monitoring software don’t always go down well. “The merchants look at Wish’s platform as very robotic,” he says, meaning there’s no way for merchants to negotiate a better deal by cultivating personal relationships with Wish staff.

 “It’ll never be perfect,” admits Tung, the GGV investor. “You get what you pay for.” But Szulczewski paints a rosier picture. The flywheel of customer data going into Wish will mean more reviews, smarter targeting software and, eventually, better-quality items. Those unbranded smartphones will get better every year, he says, “just like our iPhones.”

**tl;dr; from a more detailed DD:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o21lmu/mx\_dd\_a\_buyout\_value\_play\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o21lmu/mx_dd_a_buyout_value_play_analysis/)

* Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation is an odd company that is incorporated in Delaware, is headquartered in Luxembourg, and operates almost entirely in South Korea designing and manufacturing analog, mixed signal, and digital semiconductors. Among its various product offerings, Magnachip most notably controls the second largest market share globally for OLED display driver integrated circuits, preceded only by Samsung. Recently, their stock has seen a lot of up and down movement due to a combination of multiple potential buyout offers, shareholder litigation, and federal regulatory interference that, given the following information, presents a clear buy opportunity at the current price point.
* 1st Buyout Offer - Wise Road - buyout offer proposing the acquisition of all outstanding shares at a price of **$29 per share** \-> This led to an overnight increase in share price from the low $20s range to \~$25
* 2nd Buyout Offer - Cornucopia - This second buyout offer came with a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of $MX at **$35 per share** compared to Wise Road's $29 per share offer.
* On June 16th, the CFIUS imposed an ""Order Establishing Interim Mitigation Measures"", ordering Magnachip and Wise Road to completely halt all further progress/discussion on the merger until their review was approved. As a result, Magnachip further delayed its shareholder meeting intended for June 17th to a currently unspecified future date.

**Analysis**

As you can see from the chart the stock sky rocketed immediately (\~$23 - $26.5) after the last news regarding buyout went live. There was no time to jump in and still make a profit.

Now everyone is waiting to hear what will happen with the buyouts so the price is low. It seems that the stock hit resistance around $23.5 - $24. It's unlikely to go any lower than what it is now. Once we hear about the buyout the price will blow up immediately leaving no time to jump in then.

**My Opinion**

For risk averse people buying stock makes sense as it's hard to time when the stock will move significantly and it's very unlikely to go lower than 24$. Price target $29-$35 over the next few months.

For poor apes like me who like to yolo, the calls have low IV (\~40-50%)  and offer a lot of upside if you time it well.

The parent company of Soho House which contains the Soho House worldwide clubs, Soho Works (read below), Electric Cinemas (these make AMC ones look like fun schoolgirl projects) their own furniture brand Soho Home, and glassware brand Barwell, in addition to offshoot clubs like The Ned in London’s Square Mile and Scorpios in Mykonos is headed to IPO on the NYSE under the ticker $MCG for a valuation of between $2b to $4b 

Some quick facts:

- The IPO will be overseen by JPM and Goldman

- But ‘WTF is soho house you retard?’ I hear you ask: They are an exclusive members club for those working in the creative sector (but who also tend to be trust fund kids, bankers masking as art philanthropists - your average blue-armpit-hair Marxist artist isn’t paying $18 a cocktail but they’re always packed and getting a rooftop seat in London or New York is near impossible atm

- Their F&B margins are insane 

- Kim Kardashian has been rejected a membership over a dozen times

- haven’t turned a profit due to aggressive Goldman-backed expansion (see below): this year alone there will be openings in Rome, Tel Aviv, Brighton, Paris and London’s Strand just opened.

- they have recently made an incredible shift towards turning the membership into a digital socialising network for their members with 7-figure investments into their app alone that has clubhouse like features, noticeboards, video chat, and frankly a more useful social tool than boomer Facebook and other cancerous ‘social’ media apps: the idea being that since the members are all vetted (you need a proposer and a seconder to be granted membership) they are much more likely to reach out and socially engage with one a other 

- they have a WeWork competitor called Soho Works which is frankly nicer, cooler and more of a social status catch for trust fund kids working on their ‘startup’  than prime retard masayoshi son’s loss porn brand WeWork

- the principle holders are billionaire Ron Burkle, the founder Nick Jones, and British entrepreneur and CEO of caprice holdings, Richard Caring.

- Goldman Sachs is placing a big bet on the growth of Soho House, with a $770m (£560m) loan to further allow for aggressive expansion 

- it’s so private your wife can meet all her boyfriends there and since photography is prohibited you can still hold your head high in your community 

- Profits at Soho House soared 23% to £31.7m in 2016 revenues up by a similar margin to £273.6m.

- Turnover jumped again in the first half of 2017 by 28%, buoyed by new openings

- They made £293 million (approximately $411 million) in revenues in 2019, about half of which originated from food and drink revenues and 20 percent from recurring payments by members. The rest originated from housewares.

- it’s very pandemic/crisis proof because of being able to draw down on waitlists, according to the FT: “Soho House has been able to continue its aggressive expansion through a mixture of cost cuts, fundraising and incoming membership fees.

“Our membership model is pretty robust through a serious crisis,” said Mr Jones, who reckoned that the lengthy wait to become a member — up to 18 months in some cases — put people off cancelling.”

He also told CITY A.M.; ‘if the business needed more money post-pandemic, it would let in its “huge” waiting list of 50,000 people.’

- because of this current members are also reluctant to give up their membership because it’s so difficult to get in to start with

What is Energy Transfers LP?

Energy Transfers LP owns/maintains/builds pipelines that transport natural gas and propane (sadly they don’t transport propane accessories)

Stock Pricing:

The Price of $ET can be chalked up to 3 important factors 

1. Price of WTI (Western Texas intermediate/Price of oil) because of its ownership of Suneco

2. Price of AECO (Alberta energy company monthly index/price of natural gas) because it transports natural gas

3. Political Aspects like status of pipeline projects (Politics/Public relations) because of its pipeline ownership 


PRICE OF WTI

The price of WTI tanked because of the pandemic. The last time it was $72  Sept 2018

The Price of the stock Sept 2018 was roughly 17.50

Now that OPEC+ has gotten it’s shit together, WTI has been climbing with price estimates of 100+

Price of AECO

The price of AECO (natural gas) also tanked because of the pandemic. The last time it was 2.5 USD/MMBTu was when it AECO crashed back in 2015. The stock price fell from $30 to $9 due to the sink. AECO is forecasted to increase in the coming years 



Political Aspects:

Rick Perry is on the board of directors, his hands in politics and good standing with both Democrats and Republicans 

Judge James Boasberg has allowed the Dakota Pipeline to continue during environmental review. $ET has 36.4% interest in the Dakota Pipeline

What’s important to note is if new pipelines are not being approved, which is likely with the Biden administration, that those companies that OWN the current pipelines will have the market majority of transportation. The rest will have to use more costly methods such as rail

Takeaway

Coupang is an undervalued stock. It is in the post-IPO phase, which will introduce near-term volatility. Strong quarterly earnings growth will win the most cautious investor. This is a stock that should perform well for investors. 

Position: 450 shares with an average price of 39.30

*Note: I believe Korean dominance is priced in. Japan and Singapore will come online to provide substantial upside. The business combination of Amazon e-commerce and digital entertainment with Uber Eats services are highly attractive. I definitely believe Coupang will take over Asia as an all encompassing service provider of several services. There’s essentially no limit to the various products they could provide. I know air travel is a focus for Coupang at the moment. Im thinking real estate (Zillow, Beke, Air BNB) , car buying/rentals, expanded food delivery services to restaurants, etc.*

# How in 1930 Wyckoff Described What's Happening Today

[Richard D. Wyckoff](https://preview.redd.it/r0dndnl3zk671.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b39741d9950f15d90c73b5b49e384104492e03)

**Who Is Wyckoff?**

>*Richard Demille Wyckoff (1873–1934) was an early 20th-century pioneer in the technical approach to studying the stock market. He is considered one of the five “titans” of technical analysis, along with Dow, Gann, Elliott and Merrill. At age 15, he took a job as a stock runner for a New York brokerage. Afterwards, while still in his 20s, he became the head of his own firm. He also founded and, for nearly two decades wrote, and edited The Magazine of Wall Street, which, at one point, had more than 200,000 subscribers. Wyckoff was an avid student of the markets, as well as an active tape reader and trader. He observed the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his time, including JP Morgan and Jesse Livermore. From his observations and interviews with those big-time traders, Wyckoff codified the best practices of Livermore and others into laws, principles and techniques of trading methodology, money management and mental discipline.*

**Why I'm Including it in This Post?**

>*From his position, Mr. Wyckoff observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly fleeced. Consequently, he dedicated himself to instructing the public about “the real rules of the game” as played by the large interests, or “smart money.” In the 1930s, he founded a school which would later become the Stock Market Institute. The school's central offering was a course that integrated the concepts that Wyckoff had learned about how to identify large operators' accumulation and distribution of stock with how to take positions in harmony with these big players. His time-tested insights are as valid today as they were when first articulated.*

Basically in 1930 near his death he started writing books about what he learned during his life to make retail investors understand the market better, illustrating all his knowledge in a reddit post is impossible and today I want to focus only on market manipulation.

# Who Is The ""Composite Man""

>*“…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.”* (*The Richard D. Wyckoff Course in Stock Market Science and Technique*, section 9, p. 1-2) 

Based on his years of observations of the market activities of large operators, Wyckoff taught that:

1. The Composite Man carefully plans, executes and concludes his campaigns.
2. The Composite Man attracts the public to buy a stock in which he has already accumulated a sizeable line of shares by making many transactions involving a large number of shares, in effect advertising his stock by creating the appearance of a “broad market.”
3. One must study individual stock charts with the purpose of judging the behavior of the stock and the motives of those large operators who dominate it.
4. With study and practice, one can acquire the ability to interpret the motives behind the action that a chart portrays. Wyckoff and his associates believed that if one could understand the market behavior of the Composite Man, one could identify many trading and investment opportunities early enough to profit from them.

# The Importance Of Liquidity

Let's say a stock is sitting at $20 but a ""Pro"" thinks it could make it to be worth $40, large investors may not accumulate a high number of shares at one time as this would cause a sudden change in the stock price. Instead they will take advantage of weak market sessions to slowly accumulate their target number of shares.

Once they have accumulated their target number of shares and want to sell for the same reason as before, they can't unload everything at once or they would affect the market again.

But how can they unload their shares at maximum profit? Through manipulation. They can do it by making that shady little company look like it will become the next Apple, and they manipulate the newspapers to do it.

[FOMO](https://preview.redd.it/4ikowb6j5l671.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=949686266619575afa3c565a32df772ddf11aa1b)

They create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in small retail investors, and that brings a lot of volume on that stock. If you thought the goal of the market makers was to inflate the stock price through this type of manipulation, you're wrong.

Consider an institutional investor who bought 5,000,000 shares of a company at $1 that now sits at $3, has a lot more information about that company than you do, and knows that company is bad and likely to release bad news in a few weeks. Everyone knows that in order to sell something you need a buyer willing to pay the price you're offering, so how can he dump 5,000,000 shares of stock unnoticed in a few weeks and get away with it? He's going to start making people think that this company has something very big coming up, that he's going to make a 500% move and you're going to miss out. People start ""FOMOing"" and bring huge volume to that stock, with more people willing to buy he can sell all his shares faster and get out of that stock as quickly as possible. He doesn't care if the stock makes a 100% move in the meantime because of this sudden interest, he only cares about getting out. And guess what, later on, when the bad news is released, the market maker will be the winner while a lot of retail investors have been burned.

>“You have often noticed that a stock will sell at the highest price for many months on the very day when a stock dividend, or some very bullish news, appears in print. **This is not mere accident.**

>**The whole move is manufactured.** Its purpose is to make money for inside interests — those who are operating in the stock in a large way. And this can only be done by fooling the public, or by inducing the public to fool themselves.”

# Market Manipulation 5.0 And How You Are Helping To Make It Happen

After what happened with meme stocks in the last month a lot of people started looking to invest, without any knowledge and trusting the advice of people on reddit and other social media many found themselves losing a lot of money on some stocks that look very good.

&#x200B;

What is happening now is that some big institutions probably pay influencers and use bots to make some companies look much better than they really are. The problem is that many people trust other DDs (Due Diligence) too much and end up thinking that a stock is really good and they buy some stocks. What's worse is that a lot of times people who have invested in some companies end up becoming like extremists and start ""propagandizing"" when they see that they are losing money. 

&#x200B;

Basically what is happening is that I (and probably you too) am noticing a lot of people or groups who buy for example a stock at $10 because it is full of potential (pumped by a market maker) and when they find themselves owning it with a 30% loss they start trying to convince people that it will soon go up. This is ethically wrong and to avoid getting caught in this you should ALWAYS do your research. If you don't know how to research ask the person who posted the sources.

# How Can You Stop Losing Money On Bad Stocks

* Don't trust anyone, do your own research
* Ask for sources from those who publish DDs
* Stay away from stocks that come from scam countries
* If you see a lot of people saying a stock is going to go up stay away
* Don't buy a stock that people say will CERTAINLY have good news coming (example: ""stock X will get FDA approval next week"" usually won't and will fall into oblivion)
* If you're losing on a stock, stop saying on social media that it will surely rebound
* If you buy a stock you MUST stay current on it, you can't just buy and forget about it
* If a stock has a news related to a sector unrelated to it stay away (for example a tourism stock says it will do something in the hot sector of the moment, this is usually done to temporarily pump up the stock)
* SELL THE NEWS

7/2/21 09:53,"$CPNG DD - Korea's Amazon: deeply shorted: 500 shares available to short on 6/30 on a 1.4 billion share float, artificially suppressed price on a legit company &#x200B;

&#x200B;

[early breakout after months of suppression - past the 44\/45 wall and it rip with positive gamma](https://preview.redd.it/45f80o9jno871.png?width=1583&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef84bfb424ee8f05ce160fbbaaea865f28b3e99)

**synopsis:**

Coupang is South Korea's version of Amazon, backed by Softbank's Masayoshi Son, with aggressive plans to expand to Japan and other areas of Asia. They screwed big funds out of juicy pre-IPO shares, and so they have begun aggressively shorting the stock by call selling. Big institutions have taken the other side of the trade, and are starting to try to squeeze the stock, so their call option premiums don't go to zero.

This trade isn't retail traders vs hedgefunds, these are hedgefunds trying to outmanuveur each other. All we have to do is buy shares to put on the squeeze. And given how much hedge funds and institution like the stock, buying at this price will not be bagholding.

All you have to do is buy shares and/or calls.

**the DD:**

Big institutional buyers and hedge funds couldn't get in on $CPNG at the price they wanted, because $CPNG's pre-IPO price was only available to a small group of insiders. They have shorted the stock via short shares and call buying/put selling. Other institutional members have taken the other side, to the tune of 3.74 MILLION calls at the 45 and 50 strike.

Here's a bloomberg piece that goes into more detail about what was different in $CPNG.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-16/coupang-s-ipo-pop-served-a-purpose](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-16/coupang-s-ipo-pop-served-a-purpose)

$CPNG is so shorted that yesterday, on 6/30, **only 500 shares were available to short at one point**, out of 1.4 billion share float.

the big institutional call buyers on the other end are going to attempt to squeeze the price, so they don't lose out on their premium.

7/1/21 09:47,"VIAC: God King DD for All My Coked Out Friends VIAC is a massive media company that is selling at a deep discount and is ready for a breakout. As many of you know due to some hedge fund tom foolery (thanks Bill Hwang) VIAC lost about half of its value. He went out in true WSB fashion, but thanks to him he have some WSB opportunities.

VIAC is an old media company that has lots of appealing properties, and now has recently announced they are focusing on streaming services. In their streaming service portfolio they have Paramount+, Pluto, and Showtime with Paramount+ being their new darling garnering lots of attention.

Now many have pointed out how VIAC has an extremely low P/E, great earnings reports, and more, but repeating that would be a waste of your time and mine. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/) post if you want to learn more.

Today I would like to point a few things out that many of us haven't noticed that are food for thought:

1.Paramount+ is doing better than many would have you believe.

https://preview.redd.it/rrfh4lw9ch871.png?width=1974&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe1effae0ad2e94b4fa92682586a6ae01074b692

Now Google Trends is no guarantee for sales, but it is a good indicator of interest. I have heard lots of slander on how Paramount+ has no good shows or how it can't compete with others in the field, but frankly I disagree. Their library is impressive if you dig into it and they are adding thousands of movies as we speak. On top of that, their ad campaigns seem like they are working and streaming has been gaining quarter over quarter for them on lesser streaming services they own like Pluto (seriously who uses Pluto). Paramount+ is gaining steam and that is going to show in the next earnings report.

2. Their Earnings Projections are underestimated

https://preview.redd.it/bl0d0nxuch871.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b1b08b72987d60dd08a48a04230f24eb6a718b0

The current estimates have VIAC underperforming their last quarter. I believe there is no possible way this is the case. Their steaming revenues have vastly increased and the data coming in about their legacy cable networks indicates better than normal performance. For example, there have been reports that their ad cost per million views being higher than normal and that many of their flagship events have been going gangbusters (just see the BET awards ratings if you don't believe me). All signs are showing big revenue coming in that the analysts aren't factoring in, and I believe the earnings surprise is going to be bigger than last time.

3. The Acquisition Rumors

Out of all the major media companies that could be acquired, VIAC is the most likely to happen soon. There has been a frenzie to consolidate rights in media companies and VIAC is an obvious play for many media distributors. They are relatively cheap unlike other options like ROKU (which has been frequently talked about in acquisition rumors) and so it is very likely VIAC will be picked up in the next 6-12 months in the $70-100 dollar range.

Thesis: Nikola is about to get bonked on the head by a falling apple and will capture part of the Infrastructure Plan and the USPS truck contract.
They have no real business started yet but sit poised at the forefront of a massive new industry.


I would like to attempt to draw some correlation between Sir Isaac Newton’s “discovery” of gravity and the concept of simply being at the forefront of the right thing at the right time. 
Back in the day, meaning several hundred years ago, all discoveries and inventions were really simple and could be discovered screwing around in one’s own backyard or basement. Why? Simple things were still being discovered.
Not unimportant, just simple.
These discoverers became giants in human history by noticing, documenting, making the easily discoverable at the right time: the idea is that they were carried onward by all the weight of what was the natural progression of their discovery. 



Fast forward to today. The greatest investment opportunities lie in companies that are at the forefront of major future industries, and will capture market share.



Everyone is well aware of the shortcomings of Nikola, namely their somewhat fraudulent lack of business; However, having no business means they can become whatever they want.


Nikola is going to shock the world by becoming one of the major hydrogen fuel infrastructure companies in the next couple of years.

Most SPACs are EV, clean energy, digital finance, etc. Usually start ups with little to no revenue, operating at a loss, or futuristic tech that will change the game if it’s true and not a scam. (Nikola) 

Quantum-Si fits this mold completely with what I said above so that’s the risk factor that comes with it but it’s a one of a kind stock on the market and for some reason people are not talking about it or getting that run up like CCIV, Quantumscape, Chargepoint, CLII, Proterra, etc. Given these are all EV plays this just seems to be a less diluted market with bigger ramifications if this executes. 

Quantum Si builds a single molecule detection system with their own semiconductors.

Give us this day our daily mooning; and forgive us our short selling as we forgive those who short sell against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the hedgies. Amen.**

My dearest Apes, I speak to you again:

As you've seen from my previous posts, WKHS is legally battling with Oskosh (OSK) and the USPS over the unlawful recipient of the contract award. Well, here are some more important updates:

[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf)

**I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU THOUROUGHLY READ THE ENTIRETY OF THIS FILING\^ (IT IS LOADED WITH INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE UNLAWFUL USPS AWARDING)**

The document has been redacted (presumably due to NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) between the parties.

*""The USPS’s unreasonable actions directly harm Plaintiff... Had the USPS conducted the procurement in accordance with applicable law, the Solicitation requirements, and fundamental fairness, Workhorse would have been awarded the contract""*

*The USPS evidently decided early in the NGDV Program that Workhorse would not be the awardee, but it chose not to inform Workhorse of this fact, instead allowing and even encouraging Workhorse to continue to pursue the contract.*

*In the meantime, the USPS put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse. It falsely blamed Workhorse’s prototype vehicle for a “safety incident” that was clearly the result of the USPS driver’s error. It engaged in discussions with Workhorse that improperly failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal. And it unfairly evaluated the merits of Workhorse’s proposal, treating Workhorse far more harshly and holding it to far stricter standards, than it did the other offerors.*

*As was the USPS’s design all along, these improper actions left Workhorse with a technical score that ensured it had no fair chance of a contract award.*

***None of this was known to Workhorse.*** ""

And the coup de gras:

*""Workhorse respectfully requests this Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and to provide the following relief:*

*1. Entry of judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against the United States;*

*2. Entry of a declaratory judgment that the award to Oshkosh was unlawful and improper and an injunction directing that the award be terminated;*

*3. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to reevaluate the offerors’ proposals in accordance with the terms of the Solicitation, applicable laws, and regulations;*

*4. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to conduct a new best value determination; and*

*5. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper""*

**Now once again, I will reiterate briefly:**

* The contract was awarded to Oshkosh, who cannot confirm neither deny that the company submitted an EV model for durability testing. Nor did they say whether they have performed a powertrain transition swap, swapping out an internal combustion engine transmission for electric counterparts, as the contract stated. (See below)
* The fact that our favorite hedgies are back at it again, (See their WKHS short position below) is once again short against a company that is purposely being driven down with the help of our Post Master General for his own personal gain.

* Above, you can see that I coded shares outstanding as a percentage of WKHS shares tied into calls (meaning they are short). From the image above, you can see that more than 1.65% of shares outstanding sit at the 18 strike. Also, 1.47% shares outstanding are short at the 30 strike. Not to mention, Open Interest Updates the following trading day, so this means that WKHS was short to these percentages as of Friday's trading day close. So, let us take a closer look at the volume.
* At the 18 Strike there is currently over 37k volume and 20k volume at the 20 strike. This is massive, considering the open interest at the 18 strike currently resides at 22,065. And the 20 OI being 2,863.

However, we need to be smart apes. We are competing against the hedgies, let us remember that. So, let us look at the put side. Where is Citadel trying to press us down to?

From the looks of it, 15. Which Today, there was 13k volume in the 15 strike with only 4k OI. Presumably, a lot more puts were written today implying downward pressure.

**HERE'S THE KICKER:**

The float is roughly 135,000,000. Half is short sold (\~67 Million shares) Todays volume is 44 million+ and climbing while I write this. LOL!!!!! Do the math people. **(44/67, that is nearly 2/3's.)** We are pretty much nearing the point where if majority of the float is swallowed up and everyone sits on their hands and HODLs, you know the outcome **(GME, AMC)**. The pressure is on the hedgies my dearest Apes, we just simply buy and HODL and let those greedy bastards overleveraged themselves into bankruptcy.

6/29/21 05:05,"PSFE, Wyckoff Schematic, and the Great Tendie Heist Howdy Apes,

Longtime PSFE (bag) holder here with a bit of TA I think you might be interested in. For one, I know you all like rockets and tendies, and I also know how much you dislike ‘tutes hoarding those things to themselves. This will be discussed at length—all thanks to a little schematic posited by one of the OG apes, Richard Wyckoff.

Further, anyone else sort of think that Paysafe pump on Friday out of nowhere was a little odd? Yea, me too, and I’m a big PSFE bull (I sincerely really like the stonk and have for months). That will be discussed too.

My position: 2007 shares @$15.21. (Yep, lol). This is not intended as a pump or rescue mission. I’m content on my asteroid for the longterm. Still, I think you might be interested in this.

**A Little Background:** I, like every OG PSFE holder, had been pretty confused by the price action on this stock. Sure, the idea that a stock that you believe in and which seems like an obvious buy can be pummeled and overlooked by the market for a long time isn’t at all unheard of. We all know that feeling. It was entirely possible that I had just paid too much early and would be in it for the long haul—which was the plan anyway.

However, I couldn’t deny the maddening nature of some of the price action on this stock over the past few months, especially post-earnings. I had never seen such a seemingly inoffensive value stock (with growth potential) so strategically targeted by shorts any time a bullish reversal signal would appear. We knew it was shorts because a) the sheer capital it would take to bid hunt, and throw up cent for cent sell walls by the thousand at any pivot point on a stock with a relatively large float disqualified retail traders; and b) we could see it in the ever increasing short interest being reported.

What made it more interesting were the signals that we had a highly professional short that knew the exact price points that would lead to a reversal confirmation and yet would always seem to go right back on the defensive as soon as the price was pinned again. They never seemed to want to all out tank us. This seemed counterintuitive and led to a whole lot of conspiratorial thinking by folks—myself included. Remember, I was the guy who posted about the buyout theory a while back based on this short activity and on the (valuable) discovery of Blackstone’s securing of a controlling stake with their additional share purchase.

In any case, I kept trying to wrap my head around it while continuously hearing the word “accumulation” tossed around. I could accept that in a passive way, until last Wed. and Thu. (6/23 and 6/24). Watching our volume shoot up, inflow drastically outpace outflow, and yet trading within a few cent range—textbook signs of accumulation. That’s when I knew I needed to dig deeper, and it also when I stumbled upon the Wyckoff schematic. This changed everything about the way I look at this chart.

**Wyckoff, a brief history:** I will stick to what I consider the pertinent points of this method in relation to PSFE, but I would highly encourage you to do your own DD on the various facets of this method (the three laws, P&F charting, the composite man, etc) and its history. It’s fascinating.

Suffice it to say though, this method was created by Richard Wyckoff in the 1930’s as a way of conceptualizing market trends in terms of periods of accumulation followed by a mark up, and distribution followed by markdown. Accumulation occurs when a price is consolidating (typically following a downtrend) and big fish are gradually purchasing shares within the channel in a way that is inconspicuous and allows for some level of cost control. If they were to just buy it all outright, the stock price would go up, likely attracting attention and forcing them to load at higher prices. Distribution is the same in reverse. Simple enough? Again, most of this is built on the basic laws of supply and demand, cause and effect, and effort vs result. It’s worth digging deeper on you’re own

**The Point:** What makes it far more amazing though is that Wyckoff actually developed a specific schematic that these periods follow. This is where my mind got blown and Paysafe’s chart suddenly lit up for me (imagine Russell Crow in A Beautiful Mind, but much stupider)

https://preview.redd.it/9h5b5qioq1871.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d833db9a54db5646da949ad0c84220f1bd6c60

Notice anything specific about this schematic in relation to Paysafe’s chart? Here, I’ll help:

https://preview.redd.it/h4on23apq1871.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca1f81b60f6eab0d91592818cb5026e52f147b65

**Phase A:** The (accumulation) schematic always begins with what’s called a selling climax—the full court press that drives the price down at a rapid rate, clenching bull asses everywhere. Once that selling pressure dissipates, in comes the Automatic Rally (AR)—which is bulls taking full control and giving us a V shaped recovery back up. The bottom has now been established by sellers and the churning begins. Now look again at PSFE’s chart on Earning’s Day.

**Phase B:** Following the AR, we’ve now established the rough channel within which whales intend to load up and hope all the while that all those clenched retail bulls will bail and sell their shares for cheap. This is the game. Hallmarks of the Wyckoff schematic include: notoriously untrustworthy bullish patterns, false breakouts, and FUD. Sound familiar? They want you to sell your shares and think your stock is dead money. That way they can load up in peace without a bunch of pesky bulls (or dare I say, apes) getting all FOMO/YOLO happy and disrupting their feeding frenzy. Phase B typically includes a wave or two of sheer psychological torture, which may or may not include false breakouts above or below the bounds of that accumulation channel. Remember, they’re loading up at the bottom of those waves with all the tear soaked shares of broken retail holders. Look again at Paysafe’s charts on 6/23 and 6/24—huge volume on the buy side, no price movement. If you had watched level 2 data you would have seen how coincidentally the bid blocks mirrored the ask blocks with the buy side just being slightly larger each time. Phase B has the potential to be the longest phase and is mostly dependent on how long institutions need to load up, but then comes phase C.

**Phase C:** Okay, the institutions have now loaded up their lion’s share of the rocket so what do they do? Well, Phase C tends to be the least consistent as far the schematic goes. In Wyckoff’s model, the institutions are especially sadistic and decide to go for one last bid raid, driving the price way down once again, shredding every last paper hand and setting up the real launchpad (“The spring”). This is the real reversal, and the truest test of diamond hands. That being said, the spring doesn’t always happen. Sometimes C can look a bit more like a small subset of D, maybe with a test somewhere in the middle of the channel. Sometimes not. The point is, things are turning around and ‘tutes are ready for their tendies—or should I say, YOUR tendies if you sold.

**Phase D:** And herein lies the final test. Phase D carries us out of the accumulation channel and leaves bulls with one final test—the Sign of Strength. Here we begin to see bullish signals like flags, pennants, etc. and basically what’s happening is the top of the channel begins to be tested for support. If bulls succeed and there isn’t more opportunity for whales to go down and keep right on loading, so begins the markup phase.

**Phase E:** Now the game has changed and it’s time to ride the rocket up until whales decide they either want to take their sweet stolen profits (distribution) or we pause for another fuel up. They will do whatever they can to get every last one of us on board and touch the farthest reaches of the galaxy.

**Here’s the interesting point that inspired me to write this up today:** Take a good hard look at the timing on PSFE’s chart. Notice anything interesting about the price action on Friday into today? Coming out of the base of an accumulation channel after a B wave, we suddenly have PSFE popping up all over WSB. Look, I’ve been in this thing for months, I’m holding long because I believe in it and would love for it to get all the attention it can.

However, even the apes on WSB were commenting on how “out of nowhere” the pump came from—many of the posts from new accounts. It was bizarre. Exciting, but bizarre, and that’s coming from someone who wants for this to pump (and not dump). Now look at the price action today in regards to the Wyckoff structure. Sure looks an awful lot like a sign of strength right in the correct position and a big fat bull flag to boot. EDIT: the abbreviation on the sign is getting autobanned, so that's why I keep typing it out, lol

https://preview.redd.it/15mmq5trq1871.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d1ac0c2f50fc8fb7b8907d9fd4a81e4d3861f9a

Initially, I would have said that we are premature on this sign of strength. We were most likely due for another B wave, and maybe we are. However, I can’t help but ignore that timing within the structure and the fundamental psychology behind the markup (PUMP!). Again, this is just one possible read within the schematic, and I'd be interested to hear other reads on it too. I'm no expert.

Therefore, I guess the point I’m trying to make here is, we have been operating within an age old structure for accumulation which has certainly given me some solace on this stock. We already knew whales were loading up and now we have technical evidence to prove it. However, somebody is ready for this thing to move—whether that’s apes, the ‘tutes that had been loading, or somebody who wants to spoil it for them. Hold tough, bulls. The rocket has been fueling up for awhile. They just hoped you were going to bail before take off.

**TL;DR:** Institutions were hoping you weren’t going to catch them buying up all the seats on the PSFE rocket these last few months. They’ve been buying them up dirt cheap. You want them to take her back down and buy the rest? or do you think Planet Paysafe, rich in bountiful tendies, has room for us too?

7/18/21 08:05,"Saucy Play - Ketchup 😉 Kraft Heinze $KHC **Disclaimer: This is my first DD, and probably terrible enough to be flared as a shitpost**

# CONTEXT: why all the ketchup talk?

>The ketchup thing all started when I posted an image of my Pizza, with ketchup on it, to the weekend thread, only to be bombarded with people telling that ketchup on pizza is fucking psycho. I then confessed to using ketchup on curry, which only made the situation worse for me.

This led to a wonderful idea... invest in ketchup - specifically Kraft Heinz.

# NASDAQ: KHC - Kraft Heinz

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gt8z47lz7ub71.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0eae5de0da63eb365d2eb868bca88a242ab518c5

I'm sure we're all pretty familiar with Kraft Heinz, they manufacture and market food and beverages products internationally. Here's a long list of the kind of products, cuz why the fuck not:

*Condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats and seafood, frozen and chilled foods, packaged drinking pouches, appetizers, nuts and salted snacks, refreshment beverages, coffee, infant and nutrition products, and other grocery products, as well as desserts, dressings, toppings, and baking. The company offers its products under the Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Velveeta, Lunchables, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, ABC, Master, Golden Circle, Quero, Plasmon, Wattie's, Pudliszki, Classico, T.G.I Fridays, and Taco Bell Home Originals brand names.*

&#x200B;

$KHC currently has a market cap of $48.07 billion, with a share price of $39.30. For you short enthusiasts, there are 20.47 million shares short, which is 3.09% of the float (674.28 million).

&#x200B;

# Income Statement:

* Revenue - $26.42B
* Revenue per share - $21.60
* Quarterly revenue growth (yoy) - 3.80%
* Gross profit - $9.17B
* EBITDA - $7.15B
* Quarterly earnings growth (yoy) - 48.90%

# 

# KETCHUP SHORTAGE!

After enduring a year of closures (apparently some virus was going around, dunno if you'd heard), many American restaurants are facing a nationwide ketchup shortage. Also, packet prices are up 13% since January 2020.

Long John Silver's LLC, a chain with almost 700 units, had to seek ketchup from secondary suppliers because of the increase in demand. The demand is due to the industry's shift to packets, which has obviously pushed up prices.

*“Everyone out there is grabbing for ketchup,” - Chief Marketing Officer Stephanie Mattingly*

Ketchup is the most-consumed table sauce at U.S. restaurants, with approximately 300,000 tons sold to last year, according to research firm Euromonitor. Even more is eaten at home, and the pandemic helped push retail ketchup sales in the US over $1 billion in 2020, around 15% higher than 2019.

# EDIT: Daddy Buffett is also interested!

Berkshire Hathaway, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, said that their position in Kraft Heinz $KHC is the most significant investment accounted for pursuant to the equity method.

>**They're** ***325,442,152 shares*** **deep!**

# WHY HEINZ THO?

Heinz is the king of ketchup, and has been around for over 150 years! They own nearly 70% of America's ketchup market share.

To keep up with the demand, Steve Cornell, Kraft Heinz's President of Enhancers, Speciality, and Away from Home Business Unit, said the company plans to open new manufacturing lines, increasing production by 25% (12 BILLION packets per year).

# 

# PRICE TARGET + FUTURE:

Analysists estimate a fair value of $83.80, which is a 100%+ increase from the current price of $39.30.

I believe the future is bright, with restaurants reopening, more people travelling, and generally people going out. Wherever you go, if there's a place to buy food, there's most likely the option of Heinz Ketchup.

&#x200B;

I currently don't have a position in this stock (to be fair, the idea only came up today, and it's the fucking weekend). Perhaps this could be a reopening play, which hasn't had its time to shine yet!",51674,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999589145,True

7/15/21 07:57,"Playboy DD ($PLBY) - a Becky play Gather round for this DD on PLBY, my first post after living as a lurker for \~2 years. I am retarded, functionally literate, not a financial advisor, but I like the stock.

TL;DR

Bullish on tits. Bullish on sex. Bullish on $BECKY. Bullish on your wives’ desperation to impress their boyfriends. PLBY is an undervalued BECKY play. ANALysts give a $55 target, this is the story of my $53 valuation.

History

We all remember PLBY as a media company. Sticky magazines, Hugh Hefner, the Rabbit Head logo, and the Playboy Mansion reality TV shows. The old days are only tangentially relevant to the publicly traded company that PLBY is today. The Chad-centric legacy media business is important because the 60 year iconic history created [97% unaided brand awareness](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/3cc8cc18-d6fd-4193-8dcc-d62199a21642). This led to Playboy being one of the [top 20 Licensed brands](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/3cc8cc18-d6fd-4193-8dcc-d62199a21642) in the world. PLBY has been under private equity management since 2011. Ben Kohn, formerly a partner at the private equity firm, became the PLBY CEO. The point I am trying to make here is that the CEO has been involved with the company for nearly a decade and isn't some career switching Boomer fucktard failure off the street that they picked to run it after announcing a SPAC deal in October 2020. As far as SPACs go, this one is less retarded than most because it actually has products (ok) and revenue (very wow).

&#x200B;

Business Model and Description

PLBY 2021 is focused on monetizing the brand via direct to consumer (DTC) sales and licensing arrangements. PLBY pivoted from selling titty mags to Chad, to selling clothing and sexual wellness products to Becky (and some adventurous Chads). Sexual wellness products range from sex toys, lube, condoms, and other bedroom accessories that make Boomers and Catholics cringe, but more importantly represent a large, growing, and fragmented Total Addressable Market (\~[$300B](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/3cc8cc18-d6fd-4193-8dcc-d62199a21642)) in a culture increasingly accepting of sexual openness and women’s empowerment. They also have licensing agreements for other retailers (Pac Sun and the like) to sell clothing in their stores. Once Hefner (RIP) was out of the way the private equity firm took off their helmets, wiped away their drool, and said, “Hurrr durrr, instead of taking a \~5% royalty on other people selling our brand, let’s sell it ourselves directly to consumers and book profit at \~20-30% retail margins.” The DTC push captures \~5x the profit on the same sale and cuts out the middle people. This paradigm shift represents a tremendous opportunity and is why Ben Kohn left the private equity firm Rizvi Traverse to run PLBY. Given years of existing licensing agreements, PLBY estimates that [$3B](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/3cc8cc18-d6fd-4193-8dcc-d62199a21642) is spent on the brand each year. For FY2020 PLBY had $147M revenue meaning the runway to capture money *already being spent* on the brand is YUUGGE.

Strategy

The SPAC deal gave PLBY cash to use on acquisitions and there are two significant ones to discuss. An important thing about these acquisitions is that PLBY is buying established customer bases with each deal. Just ask Chipotle, Starbucks, and LULU how loyal their BECKYs are.

[Honey Birdette](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/53d625af-728d-4e95-b32d-60445bacabe0): Announced June 29th 2021, Honey Birdette sells lingerie, sex toys, swim wear, and lounge wear. For the year 2020 they ran at $50M revenue and $14M EBITDA. For 2021, they are projected to run at $73M revenue and $28M EBITDA. Home market is Australia, but growing significantly in the US and UK. DTC-omnichannel model with ecommerce making up 50% of sales and 50% coming from retail stores. PLBY says that this acquisition accelerates their private label development which is undoubtedly true. They basically bought a high growth lingerie designer with excellent customer lifetime value. On an earnings call Ben Kohn said, “A huge market for lingerie, unbelievable margins.” Yea no shit! [$100](https://us.honeybirdette.com/collections/bras) for \~$3 worth of threads?

Yandy: This acquisition gave PLBY a foothold in DTC with an online presence, warehousing/distribution facilities, and customer base. Yandy sells lingerie and other accessories. All the girls you subscribe to on onlyfans have likely bought things from Yandy. Your wife might have too, but she only wears it for her boyfriends. The [website](https://www.yandy.com/playboy.php) is now fully integrated with PLBY branded products, notably lingerie with those very high margins the CEO drools over. It is worth noting that Honey Birdette does not yet have PLBY branded products on their website, but they do offer higher price point products than Yandy (even better margins).

PLBY is expanding internationally with plans to launch products in India, Russia, and South America. Consider all the time you spend on Pornhub. How much content is Indian or Russian? Exactly. PLBY’s sexual wellness products coupled with the worldwide brand recognition are going to be too much for those horny mf’s to pass on. The worldwide recognition and association of the Rabbit Head logo is almost impossible to replicate (without billions of investment) today which gives PLBY a significant head start in a fragmented sexual wellness/lingerie market.

Balance Sheet

If you’re still reading congrats, I am mildly impressed. PLBY does have a healthy-ish balance sheet and is not over leveraged. I think the days of negative EBITDA quarters are behind them which will continually strengthen their cash positioning and balance sheet. This year they also refinanced their [debt](https://www.plbygroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/plby-group-announces-successful-completion-debt-refinancing) which saves them money on interest and gives them greater borrowing flexibility to fund acquisitions.

Valuation

PLBY is difficult to value since it is in the early innings of what the company is ultimately going to look like. Many assumptions about future digital and physical product offerings are necessary. For example, you might wholeheartedly believe in whatever the fuck an NFT is and be bullish on PLBY monetizing their content library via that avenue (their first [NFT art drop](https://www.plbygroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/playboy-and-nifty-gateway-partner-bring-70-year-art-legacy) generated $1M sales in 24 hours). You might also be very bullish on future cosmetic products that PLBY is going to offer (makeup made Kylie a billionaire). You are reasonable to be concerned with when/if PLBY is going to do another share offering and dilute the equity depending on your investment time horizon and personal risk tolerance. This business is also seasonal. You know how excited you get checking instagram during Halloween to see all those \*costumes\*? Well, Becky knows you’re creeping and doesn't want to disappoint. You know all that Santa’s little helper porn you watch over the holiday season? Well all that lingerie comes from somewhere and PLBY is doing their damndest to make sure it comes from them. Q4 earnings are not going tits up.

My forecast has PLBY doing $400M revenue in 2023. Since most of us can’t read, let alone understand a DCF I will spare you most of the details, but given the rapid pace of growth, new product introductions, and unpredictable acquisitions this might be a conservative projection. At a 12% EBIT margin this leads to about $1.15 EPS. LULU trades at 47x 2023 forward P/E so if PLBY trades at that multiple it's a \~$53 stock.

ROTH gave them a $55 price target upgrade on the news of the Honey Birdette acquisition. Sidoti & Company gave them a $46 target. I think they are trading at a discount these days because of a general rotation out of small caps and a weariness of consumer discretionary stocks in the face TrAnsITOry iNFLatiOn, but what the fuck do I know.

7/14/21 19:54,"Tesla leads! U.S. electric vehicle registrations increased by 95% from January to April Although electric vehicles now account for only a small part of the total global car sales, the global adoption of electric vehicles is significantly accelerating. According to foreign media reports, this is obvious in the first four months of 2021 in the United States. Compared with the same period in 2020, the number of electric vehicle registrations in the country has increased by 95%. 

　　 According to a new report by Experian, from January to April 2021, the total number of new car registrations in the United States was 36% higher than the same period last year. Part of the reason is as the country's economy recovers from the epidemic. 

　　According to a MarketWatch report, in the first quarter of 2021, electric vehicles still accounted for only 2.3% of the US market, but during this period, the rate of customers registering new electric vehicles was three times that of other types of new vehicles. Tesla remains the dominant player in this category, with 71% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States being the company's cars. 

　　 Two main models are among the best among competitors: Tesla Model Y has 53,102 new registrations, and Model 3 has 35,468 registrations. Followed by Chevrolet Bolt with 13,611 registrations, Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,104 registrations, and Nissan Leaf with 5,023 registrations. In addition, the top 10 most registered electric vehicles in the United States are Audi e-tron (4321 vehicles), Porsche Taycan (3002 vehicles), Hyundai Kona (2192 vehicles), Tesla Model X (1730 vehicles) and Tesla Model S (1633 vehicles). 

　　 From the perspective of each region, in the first quarter of 2021, Golden State accounted for 38% of new electric vehicle registrations, while Florida accounted for 7.2%. Texas has not yet allowed Tesla to sell its cars directly to customers.

7/13/21 14:10,"Activision Blizzard (ATVI) - ""The Most Epic Interactive Gaming and Entertainment Experiences on Earth"" The title is taken directly from the company's mission statement. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is the video game holding company responsible for the biggest hits in gaming including Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Diablo, Hearthstone, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, among many others. The company is one of the oldest third-party video game developers. It has a successful track record  that rivals the industry giants like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. The company survived the great fall of revenue in the gaming industry in the mid-80s and came back strong years later. In the 90s Bobby Kotick bought the company and has been CEO ever since. Kotick is actually the longest-tenured CEO of an S&P 500 company. It's safe to say that Activision Blizzard has solid and reputable management.

The success of the company is mostly attributed to quality acquisitions of gaming studios. We're talking Activision, Blizzard Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Infinity War, Sledgehammer Games, Toys for Bob, Treyarch, and Vicarious Visions. If you don't know of or have played a game created by one of these names you are living under a rock, under a boulder, under a mountain. Video games produced by these studios have revolutionized their genres and the industry as a whole.

Countless hit games results in countless sales. The companies EBITDA has grown pretty steadily over the last 6 years and is forecasted to grow even faster over the next 4 years. EBITDA in 2014 was $1.5B. EBITDA in 2020 was $3.3B. EBITDA in 2024 is estimated to be $5.7B.

The semi-conductor ""chip"" shortage has created a great opportunity to invest in ATVI. Let's look at the numbers in a different way. Sony's PS5 sales within the first year are at 7.8 million units compared to the PS4 which sold 7.6 million units in the first year, and it hasn't even been a full year since the release of the PS5. The Xbox Series X is the same story but we don't know the numbers. 7.8 million units is not even the full potential of the PS5 sales. Sony and Microsoft have been stalled by the chip shortage. Gaming consoles have been selling out much faster than the companies can produce them. That being said, the chip shortage should calm down and Sony and Microsoft are doubling production. Limitless hype + double production = double sales.

But remember, I'm not suggesting anyone buys Sony or Microsoft in this thread. I'm suggesting you buy Activision Blizzard. The latest generation gaming consoles are equipped with SSD, AMD CPUs, and AMD GPUs that allow for ray tracing technology. The ceiling that limited the gaming experience has been shattered. Games will be more realistic, beautiful, fun, immersive, and addicting than ever before. Activision Blizzard makes the best games. Activision Blizzard's video game releases and sales are partially dependent on the gaming consoles reaching maximum sales.

The video game industry has changed drastically. The growth in the population of gamers and the diverse age groups that game today will slingshot the industry to a $300B market sooner than you might think. Adolescent kids, young adults, and older people that don't have jobs spend hours playing Call of Duty. Stay-at-home moms stare at their phone screens without breaks and relentlessly swipe their credit cards for more lives in Candy Crush. Everyone loves Activision Blizzard games.

Take a look at the technicals. Two years after the release of the last generation of gaming consoles (PS4 and Xbox One) ATVI stock price doubled. Less than five years after the aforementioned release the stock price quadrupled.  Following a sharp dip in late 2018 the stock traded a wide base. The price then broke out from a C&H trend in late 2020 and has recently formed a bull flag. Currently, the stock is consolidating and should soon bounce off long-term support and break out from that bull flag. The stock is primed for a rally. My price target before the end of the year is +130.00.

**TL;DR** 

There has never been a more exciting time for the gaming industry and Activision Blizzard is a great company with an impressive portfolio.

7/11/21 08:18,"PSFE, Wyckoff pt.3: A Dream of Spring Dearest WSB,

Me again, just one of your many resident PSFE bagholders—but not just any PSFE bagholder, the one who is convinced he's uncovered the tutes' secret moon party itinerary that they've been planning out for months right in front of our eyes on PSFE. In fact, they're using the exact same playbook that they've been using successfully for a hundred years.

That playbook, once again, comes courtesy of OG Ape Lord, Richard ""D” Wyckoff and his century old accumulation schematic.

As in my last post, I won’t ramble on with an explanation of the schematic or how it works. You can find that in my initial post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9ptcy/psfe_wyckoff_schematic_and_the_great_tendie_heist/). You can also check out pt. 2 of this saga where I discussed what I was looking for going into this past week, the mysterious WSB pump, and an explanation of the Wyckoff psychology: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/od73un/psfe_wyckoff_pt_2_the_dark_night_of_the_diamond/).

To those who read my last post, I hope you’re feeling positively springy. To those who didn’t, that’s okay, I’ll make it simple for you.

\*\*\*DISCLAIMER EDIT: 7/14/21, As of today and yesterday's price action, some of the claims I make in this post regarding my read on where we currently are in the structure have since been disproven. That's, of course, the nature of the game, but I don't want anyone stumbling on this after fact and not being equipped with updated information. The Wyckoff read itself has not in any way been invalidated in my honest opinion, nor has my view that we are currently in the C phase (based on low volume/low liquidity), however having just broken below the spring I talk about in this post today, it is safe to say that the idea that we were coming out of the C phase going into this week has been disproven. I won't delete any of the original post as I stand by the view I held with the information at the time, but I'm just trying to be as upfront and honest about it as possible as I was when I posted this. Make your own read, I still think there's a lot of value in the thesis itself, especially as the schematic can play out in a number of variations, especially in the C phase, but one last time, all I'm trying to do is equip you with a possible lens through which you can strengthen your own DD and therefore don't want since dated information misleading you in that quest. My position and my conviction in the validity of the Wyckoff here remain unchanged.\*\*\*

**The point of the Wyckoff accumulation structure is to illustrate an age old way in which institutions like to accumulate a ton of shares as cheap as possible without alerting the masses to their strategy and risking having to chase the price up. How do they do it? By poaching retail stop losses/panic sellers (liquidity) any chance they get and demoralizing them through frequent false breakouts. As a PSFE holder who has watched this thing day in and day out for months: Check and check.**

**PREFACE:** Honestly, I wasn’t sure a pt. 3 would be necessary, at least until we ended up closer to the end of the structure—or behind the Wendy’s dumpster (which always remains a distinct possibility). However, we gained a lot of information this week that further validated what I had laid out in pt. 2 and which I think you might be interested in reading.

My position: 2009 @ $15.21 and 30 August $12c (so far) and a few up the chain for July for good measure (and because they’ve already been eaten alive, so why sell? lol)

Okay, now on to an update of where I see us in the schematic.

**RECAP:** When last we talked, PSFE had begun steadily coming back down from our 10% day following a suspicious pump on WSB that I do believe was an orchestrated attempt by the whales to generate more bagholders and, in turn, panic sellers. Remember, they want every last paper hand shaken out of this channel so that when they give the signal for liftoff they can be certain that all liquidity has been drained—giving them a cement floor and a cabin full of all their big money friends and only the most battle tested diamond hands. They need to know that they’ve bought up all that they can and need to for a successful launch.

Here’s our chart going into this past week as well as the Wyckoff schematic:

https://preview.redd.it/ome0jm93bga71.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=7aecd98bf3e44f43676f65a0e63d5981ba306fc9

https://preview.redd.it/t05e7xo3bga71.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6a2d45f26ef9a7891d7849dee7581d9acce9bb

Now, I had said that I believed we were entering the C phase of the Wyckoff—the final shake out, the one where institutions gradually test for liquidity at each support line just hoping that they’ll find capitulating retail waiting to be robbed. With each move down, they would put just a little more pressure on your conviction, begging you to bail.

We had already seen it start—following relatively high volume institutional accumulation happening at the $12 level on 6/29 and 6/30—with 7/1’s low volume bounce off of $11.67 to close at $11.77 (corresponding support: $11.72), and 7/2’s low volume close at $11.42 (support: $11.41). No discernible panic selling or institutional unloading here.

**What happened?**

Tuesday and Wednesday (7/6, 7/7) saw a move down into the original supply zone (\~$11.08- $11.28) on pitiful volume each with a bounce off of $11.13 and closes at $11.25 and $11.15, respectively.

No paper hands/liquidity there either.

[UPDATE: As of 7\/14, this spring has been retested, therefore calling into question the validity of the \\""spring\\"" shown here. ](https://preview.redd.it/8vsynp86bga71.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec5d274e0fdfecde206c909240f8ebe0b14c1f18)

**And then, A Dream of Spring:** One of the hallmarks of the Wyckoff C phase is what’s called the spring. Not every schematic has to have one, but it is the point in the structure where big money attempts one final shake out by pulling the rug out from underneath retail in an attempt to suck in every last stop loss they can before demand seizes back control. These usually look like an aggressive sell off (on suspiciously low volume) that breaks beneath the structure and incites hopelessness the world over. I had said to look out for it. It could have gone all the way down past $10.23 (the selling climax), but it seemed to me that based on where our demand had shown up in the past, it would likely see upper $10s at the lowest.

At last, 7/8 PSFE opens all the way down at $10.81, smashing below the demand zone. Admittedly, it was in the midst of a brutal day in the market, but, surprisingly, the bottom didn’t fall out. Diamond hands prevailed in our darkest hour, and from there, we would see bulls carry us all the way back to an $11.16 close (while testing the bottom support of the demand zone).

To be honest, I was hesitant to call the spring there as it was hard to discern how much of the plummet was the result of macro factors and how much was, indeed, that spring we were hoping for. However, yesterday (7/9) gave us even more information.

https://preview.redd.it/orgd12aabga71.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f71b03842cc07d6f654e55414e64963f80104b2

[Here it is with lines on the hourly if that's easier for you](https://preview.redd.it/rrvipjlabga71.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=ace275d46176aaae37e214829e73b2a3c4c01cb2)

**C Phase:** What I would hope for following a spring would be a similar gradual test of support/resistances and liquidity—this time on the ascent. In other words, I was hopeful that we would at least reclaim $11.28 on a move up, likely with some measure of volume restraint but tilted towards the bulls on rises. Remember, the institutions are in total control still. They aren’t ready to mark her up yet. They just want to know that the channel is bone dry.

**What we got:** A 3% move up all the way to an $11.52 close on absolutely embarrassing volume. Even more interesting, buying volume seemed to increase throughout the day consistent with moves up. What this tells me is that not only is liquidity pretty well completely drained from the channel, much of the buying pressure was actually coming out of the float and not in their secretive price pinning sort of way. Great sign, in my opinion.

**Why this matters for you:** After this week’s action, I believe the darkest night for Paysafe is now behind us in terms of the Wyckoff. This looks like a textbook C phase to me with the potential of today being the start of a D phase. Congratulations to those who jumped in this week looking for a spring, but for those who didn’t, I do believe the rocket is looking to be in the final stages of prepping for take off. This is not me saying BUY. Do your own DD. It is simply me, a content bagholding long term PSFE believer (with or without Wyckoff), saying it’s one to watch in the coming week(s).

[UPDATE: As of this week, this opinion is not accurate. I still believe we are in C phase, but more likely at the beginning of it as of 7\/14 ](https://preview.redd.it/lfv56lzebga71.jpg?width=747&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d228040be043ad4524762cec04b07e83519c78d)

**What to watch for:** Within the structure, it is entirely possible that we have another test of that $11.28 level to complete a C phase and then our measured move up over the top of the structure for the final test of strength, or it is possible that we are now currently sitting at the beginning of a D phase. We’ll need to see where it goes from here to determine that. I'll post again if I see the signs of a sign of strength test when we get there-- if anyone out there finds this content useful (or, at least, mildly entertaining).

What follows the D phase? The mark up. This is when the rocket ship, loaded to the brim with big money, seek the upper reaches of the galaxy with every tailwind they can muster at our back. They will aim to get it as high as they can before either re-accumulating more or entering into a distribution phase where the roles are reversed, and they want to sell us all a rocket ship that’s run out of fuel. You’ll know all this when you see it.

[Check out the volume trendline compared to the OBV on the above charts](https://preview.redd.it/x5uwbbzhbga71.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=21af7b9ecf4d2b9e9e437156fefe0b5303a5f168)

The point is, make your own call, and obviously remember, I certainly could be looking at this all wrong, but it has played out in textbook enough fashion that I think it’s worth continuing to hand over the plans as I see them because I like the idea of retail not losing hope and eventually crashing the moon party. I’m always open to feedback.

Also worth noting: Next Friday has a good amount of open call interest starting at 12.5 which falls dead center of the supply zone 11.4-11.64. That will be an interesting level to watch. I have a hard time thinking they’ll cede those options (unless institutions are the ones loaded up), though it’ll be worth seeing what happens there.

Further, check out the section of my last post that discusses the first PIPE lockup expiry language. Like I said there, I personally believe they’re unlocked and clearly haven’t been sold, though there are some who interpret that expiration as happening on Monday July 12.

It’s finally going to be fun to watch the new 13Fs pouring in. PSFE already had 58.11% WITHOUT Q2 purchases being reported yet. We had one roll in today that I expect to be the first of many. It's also interesting to note that Fintel Pro lists a float of only 146.7m before subtracting the 22.67m (15.45% of float) shares shorted. Yes, that 146.7m is awfully close to the initial number given for public shareholders when PSFE went public, and I don't have a way (that I know of) to go back and see when Fintel has that number starting, but I feel it's worth mentioning here merely with the intention of saying I do believe this ""PSFE has a massive float"" argument is unfounded--which can be corroborated imo by some of the extreme price control and volatility on low volume within a channel that some sites still list as having an enormous float. This Fintel number would translate to 82.59% of the OS being spoken for (including shorts). FWIW, both Yahoo Finance and Finviz now have it down at 164.47m---still a notably small number compared to MarketWatch's 491.99m.

Make your own judgement on it. I'll include a picture of the Fintel Data as well as the share breakdown in the original filings so that you can make your decision.

NOTE: The relevance of the Wyckoff analysis doesn't at all hinge on this float discussion, but, again, I thought it was at least interesting enough to include. If the float is indeed that small though, it does suggest to me that the mark up phase will be all the more extreme.

All in all, safe travels, apes!

**TL;DR:** After this week, I believe even more strongly that Paysafe is playing out a textbook Wyckoff accumulation schematic where whales have been buying up every last seat for an inevitable rocket launch under our noses. Further, I believe we fulfilled the spring of the C phase meaning the bottom is now behind us, and we’re currently witnessing the gradual raising of the rocket from the subterranean bunker up to the launch pad.

This is not investment advice whatsoever. I’m just a guy on Reddit. It also still isn’t me begging or telling you to buy here. It’s just me giving you some telltale signs to look out for as you do your own DD. Some have suggested waiting until you can buy into the strength of a mark up phase, your call. Never a bad idea, especially since the hallmark of this phase of the structure is painfully low volume—indicating low liquidity—but I personally believe institutions have been loading this entire channel for months at these very prices.

All in all, I think the rocket engines are being gradually powered up here. Whereas there is still, so far as we know, 22.67m shares shorted (15.45% according to Fintel), I don't consider that the important part; rather, I see this as an opportunity to crash a moon party big money has been planning all for themselves for months. Consider climbing aboard, if it suits ya. If you’re already aboard, hodl on tight!

The biggest warning signs that this shit could out-mutate the vaccine:

* Countries such as Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, etc. have been hit hard recently even with many hardline restrictions already in place. These former restrictions aren't as effective as they were when the original strain first hit in 2020
* All news articles talk about vaccines being effective against the **Delta** **Variant.** This seems like a convenient way to say ""everything is fine"". I'm not concerned with the Delta variant, I'm concerned with the next generations of mutations.

8/13/21 10:23,"DD on MINISO($MNSO) As of the press time, $MNSO fell 3.16% to $14.1.

**MINISO is a Japanese-inspired lifestyle product retailer, offering high-quality household goods, cosmetics, and food at affordable prices.** The company was founded in 2013 with the headquarter in Guangzhou, China. By the end of March, the company has opened 4,587 stores in 94 countries and regions, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Spain, UAE, India, and Mexico. It was listed on New York Stock Exchange on October 15, 2020.

The original mission of MINISO is to release the pressure on youth and improve the quality of their lives. With the slogan of “a better life has nothing to do with the price”, the company is committed to providing affordable products for the young. There are three core principles on which the company is based: **Affordable High Quality**, which means guiding decisions from design to materials; **Joy**, referring to the response its customers experience while in MINISO stores; and **Lighthearted**, which refers to the relaxed and happy feeling when encountering the large variety of goods available.

Giving great priority to the original design, the company has established the MINISO Design Academy (MDA) and teamed up with some of the best designers from Finland, Denmark, Norway, Spain, and South Korea to create high-quality products. Besides, the company has collaborated with world-famous brands including Coca Cola, Marvel, Hello Kitty, Sesame Street, Mickey and Minnie, Pink Panther, We Bare Bears, and Beijing’s Palace Museum, launching diverse products which have gained great popularity all over the world.

According to $MNSO’s financial report in Q3 2021FY, the revenue was RMB2.229 billion, with a YoY increase of 36.51%; the net growth was RMB356.5 million, with a YoY increase of 18.54%.

**Business model: to open chain stores**

Two parties of the model are the MINISO company and its franchisees. All the operating costs are paid by the franchisees, while the decoration, stocking, and management of the new store are taken care of by the company itself. In another word, MINISO is GP (General partner), who just manages but do not invest money, and the franchisees are LP (Limited Partner), who only contributes money and get a monthly dividend.

The company gets money from several channels. First, when a new store joins the chain, it must offer the brand fee to the company. Then the franchisees have to deliver the goods deposit when joining the chain and the goods are all supplied by the MINISO, which is another big income because both in preparation and in operation, a steady supply of goods is needed. Finally, If the franchisee opens and operates well, MINISO can take dividends together, and if it loses money or even closes down, the company pays nothing but earns the franchise fee.

**Recent moves:**

On June 23, MINISO established a cross-border e-commerce company, with a registered capital of RMB10 million, and its business scope includes stationery supplies wholesale, shoes and hats wholesale and retail, investment activities with own funds, auto parts retail, import and export of goods, etc.

On June 28, MINISO has undergone industrial and commercial changes, the registered capital increased from RMB 300 million to RMB 600 million, an increase of 100%. At the same time, the business scope added natural science research and experimental development, information system operation and maintenance services, and investment activities with its own funds.

**In July, MINISO has committed to donating RMB5 million of emergency supplies to aid the disaster relief operations in central China's Henan province, after a severe flood caused by extremely heavy rainfall in the region.** In response to the crisis, MINISO organized staff, mainly including bottled water and convenience food, to dispatch relief supplies from six warehouses across the country to support those in most immediate need.",52445,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.980450749,True

Driven by a 91% increase in golf-equipment sales compared with the corresponding period last year, Callaway (ticker: ELY) notched a 97% year-over-year increase in revenue across all of its business lines except for Topgolf, the recreation and hospitality company it acquired earlier this year. 

Revenue and earnings were both outsize even compared with the same quarter in 2019, before the economic uncertainty stirred up by the pandemic briefly slashed spending on luxury goods. Excluding sales at Topgolf, the company reported revenue of $588 million, up from $447 million in the same quarter of 2019.

While the Topgolf business segment, which accounts for 36% of revenue, posted solid numbers, management reported that same-venue sales are still recovering and currently are around 90% of the 2019 level.

CEO Chip Brewer told investors Callaway is confident about the long-term outlook. “While in the short term we will experience some lingering supply constraints and other challenges caused by the pandemic, we believe that these challenges will be manageable given current demand levels and actions we are taking to mitigate the impact,” he said.

For the current quarter, management is expecting revenue to come in between $775 million and $790 million. That would be less than the $914 million for the most recent quarter, but Brewer said on a call to discuss the results with investors that seasonal factors mean the second quarter is generally stronger than the third.

For the full year, management expects around $3.0 billion in consolidated revenue, substantially more than the $1.7 billion in revenue generated in 2019.

Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said that while the third-quarter guidance may appear low, he believes management’s call reflects supply-chain troubles rather than problems with demand. Konik raised his target for the stock price to $49 from $45, implying a potential gain of 55%.",52647,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999673486,True

Everyone is hyping EV/batteries in expectation for the gigantic titty of all government titties: the $1T infrastructure bill. 

So calls on “growth” tickers like LEV, MVST, PTRA, etc gonna print right?

Remember when the USPS had a contract up for grabs to transition their vehicles to EV? And you retards thought WKHS was the sure play?

Wha happahn???

The US government happened. 

Workhorse employs fewer than 100 people. Oshkosh employs more than 16,000 people. 

The US government doesn’t give a flying fuck about “market disrupters”. They have infinite money and if Workhorse comes along and makes waves in the private sector and produces long-term reliable vehicles, the US government might throw them a contract someday. 

There is no EV moat. It’s a car with a battery. Your mom has an EV startup. 

There *are* car companies though. GM. Ford. Chrysler. 

These companies employ hundreds of thousands of American workers. Not a hundred. Hundreds of thousands. 

So, like the Oshkosh thing, the safe bet is on the huge automakers getting the lion’s share of whatever contracts come up. At least that’s my opinion. 

If there’s one thing the federal government loves, it’s companies that employ American workers. And the big automakers in the US employ a shit-ton of people. I’m curious to hear what y’all think. 

TL;DR: the US government is not going to let an EV start-up fuck up major auto companies’ market share and risk layoffs of workers. You were retarded to bet on WKHS. You may just be similarly retarded betting on LEV/PTRA. I think MVST is a reasonable bet tho.

8/8/21 06:47,"SPY Strangle Puts or Puts Comments IMHO, the investors are very cautious and uncertain currently judging from the mixed futures prices among the global market such as US (DJIA, SP500), Hong Kong (Hang Seng) and China. US futures normally have a positive correlation until recently where there are significant divergence from one another. The SPY recent price action also shows that its daily range are narrowing, a sign of market trading sideways, awaiting the next catalysts or bad news. 

Moreover, recently digested market data also indicates that analysts have overestimated the economic recovery from COVID with notables examples like Amazon and US NFP (Non-Farm Payroll) considerable negative variance. Central banks around the world are winding back their quantitative easing program and hinted at hiking up the interest rates. Current market headwinds are the lockdown (huge contributor to global demand), Delta COVID strain, central banks policy, trade war rhetoric and etc. 

Furthermore, bond yields (i.e. 5 and 10 years US treasury bonds) are decreasing which indicates that investors are moving their money in ‘risk-free’ government bonds because rising bond prices will reduce its yield (fixed coupon bond). US Dollar Index (DXY) has also risen tremendously recently and this signal a shift to lower risks assets such as bonds (USD priced government bonds) and away from share. Historically speaking, falling bond yields and a strengthening DXY normally indicates a correction might be incoming. SP500 has slowed recently and this trend could be attributed towards investors downgrading their valuation based on the recently announced earnings.

In relation to SPY, the price has been trading on the upper end of the Bollinger Bands but didn’t show any signs of breaking out. The linear regression shows that the price is moving around its historical average (red line) and didn’t show any signs of breaking out too. Those indicators supports the hypothesis that the market is unsure and waiting for a catalysts.
US is currently in earnings seasons and multiple companies earnings has been published and some of them are a disappointment (lower than estimates). US mining stocks underperform Global Sector Basic Material (MXI) average while its other sector like utilities and healthcare outperformed the Global sector after digesting the overall poor earnings results. Looking at the monthly growth of those ETF above, investors are currently taking a defensive and low risk approach by investing in utilities, healthcare and real estate. In an aggressive bull markets, technology and financial sector will do very well which is on the contrary to the above data.

In conclusion, the market is very likely to correct/downgrade in the coming weeks, once their earnings play are over as I can’t see any positive catalysts coming up.

8/5/21 14:45,"$MX Baby Rockets - Magnachip BuyOut Talks - $29 Offer Trading At $21 Ok, first off, this trade is a baby rocket trade.  You won't make it to the moon with this one, but it'll likely refuel your thrusters.  I'm thinking about a 20-40% bagger^(🚀🚀) as opposed to the 1000% MEME baggers 🚀🚀.  It's not pumpable, squeezable, whatever you wanna call it since there's a cap on how high the stock can go.  $29 if buyout goes through, $26 probs if we get some good news.  There's no crazy upside hype.  It's a stock with pretty clear cut risk and reward.

# Company Overview

So what is Magnachip.  Magnachip, $MX, is a semi-conductor company based in South Korea that produces OLED display drivers as well as power management integrated circuits.  Their OLED tech goes into smartphones, TVs, as well as automobiles.  Their power integrated circuits are used in automotive, 5g, and the energy industry. The company pulled in about 500M in revenue last year and has been around for 15 years and owns a portfolio of approximately 1,200 registered patents and pending applications.  So it's not a non-sense vapor-ware company.

# Why Magnachip

Magnachip is supposedly such a good investment that two firms have offered to buyout Magnachip one at $29 and one at $35.

* Wiseroad Capital offered to buy the firm at at $29:

https://preview.redd.it/gk7xf5691jf71.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7090cc6c784e994e29b84b32a3f3bd0c4a6ce26

* Cornucopia Investment Partners offers to buy the firm at $35:

https://preview.redd.it/kr2hs6651jf71.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=efbc021ae35df34e5c7a23ca351d576e2f690da8

**Note that Magnachip is trading at $21 right now. 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮**

The reason why $MX is trading at $21 right now as opposed to $29 is because the US government (as well as South Korean government) has stepped in to 'review' this buyout.  They don't want to lose another semiconductor company to China.  Wiseroad Capital is a Chinese private equity firm.  And China = Very Bad.  So buying $MX means you take on the risk that the deal falls through cuz US gov thinks China = Bad.

**With that said, even with that risk, IMO, it makes sense to buy $MX** ^(🚀🚀).  Here are a few reasons.

* I already mentioned that big boy professionals value this stock at $29 and $35.  This isn't some random analyst saying it should be worth $X.  This is an actual offer and someone is willing to drop billions on this company.  With that said, even without the offers do some Googling and you can see that average price target for $MX is around $26.
* The merger announcement with Magnachip occurred at the end of March 2021 (although some say there had been whispers since January), sending $MX from about $20 to $26.  **We are now basically at the same price PRIOR to the merger announcement**.  And if you think the whispers occurred in Jan (I can't find any articles, then pre-merger price is $18).  The press release cites $18.83. Regardless, either most people think that the merger is not going to happen, or this stock is a victim of the tech/small cap crash we've seen in the past month.  But we are basically at pre-merger prices.
* $MX already accepted a deal from Wiseroad and it is just subject to review.  According to SA, If the merger is terminated because, MX accepts a superior proposal, it would be required to pay $42.1 million (roughly 3 percent of the transaction value) to Wise Road. If the deal is terminated for the following, Wise Road is required to pay MX the respective termination fee: $70.2 million (5 percent) for failing to receive U.S. regulatory approval, $84.3 million (6 percent) for failure to receive South Korean regulatory approval, and $105.3 million (7.5 percent) for any other reason notwithstanding U.S. and South Korean approvals.  **In OTHER WORDS, even IF, the deal falls through, $MX will get paid.**
* Also, even if this deal falls through, it's not unlikely that another investment firm will try to buy out $MX.  Or, $MX just does so well in the next few years that it eventually trades at $29.

Do I think the deal will go through?  Honestly, I'm just an ape so no idea.  But note that most of Magnachip's sales are to Samsung as well as to companies in China.

https://preview.redd.it/fl9rrwug1jf71.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=50d838473679073490e07b5823bd68f58e834f29

Meaning, it rarely sells to companies in the US.  In other words, from a trade and technological standpoint, the US doesn't stand to lose much if China does end up owning the company.  South Korea, could stand to lose out.  But Wiseroad was willing to give up 84M if South Korea does not approve the deal.

**So when is the deal expected to go through**?  Some say by the end of this year.  But recently, the US announced that it plans to be done with it's part of the review by 9/13.

https://preview.redd.it/sbgnpw5m1jf71.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=762d12f5a11f92530589b050ba0f0ec485303551

As for when South Korea will be done?  Who knows.  I'd imagine it would be shortly after .  OR, South Korea may have even been ok with it in the first place, and are just waiting for the US.  Who knows.

But the deadline to keep in mind is 9/13, and obviously it could be A LOT SOONER.  Personally, I'm thinking, if the buyout gets OKed, $MX goes to $26 after confirmation and then goes to $29 eventually.  But, if it falls through, it'll probably fall to $18 or so and then it may eventually be bought out for even more!  Someone was willing to pay $35 at one point.

8/3/21 21:05,"There it is again, that $FIZZ-y feeling TL;DR - FIZZ is the owner of La Croix, the sparkling beverage that is taking Coca Cola and others to the cleaners without even really trying. People who drink this stuff are absolutely addicted. Healthy company financially, relatively undervalued compared to peers and potential short term catalysts via expansion into seltzers or acquisition due to an aging CEO and majority owner.

# FIZZ IN MY PANTS

This is a ticker that has been stalling out on supremely low volume lately, but one that has a load of potential catalysts & volatility currently unaccounted for in the share or derivative prices.

I present to you: **National Beverage Corp**. aka **$FIZZ** aka your girlfriend's/wife's/girl you stalk's favorite beverage company that she doesn't know about aka owners of La Croix.

This is a **weird** fucking company. The CEO owns something like 80% of the total shares. He is very old, and I'm not sure if anyone knows what his plans are for the company in the near term as he considers riding off into the sunset. Here is why I think they are worth a lil play:

# Market/Opportunity/Continuation of shift in consumer preferences

So Ronaldo moves a Coke bottle and says ""agua"" and the world loses its fucking mind - wipes out 4b in Coke's market cap. Overreaction right? Maybe not. GenZ goes nuts for this stuff, **81% of La Croix consumers drink at least one per day** \- that is crack. 

There has been a not-so-secret shift towards healthier beverages over the past several years. All of these social media influencers and athletes are pushing (generally via sponsorship but sometimes candidly as was the case with Ronaldo) healthy beverages and lifestyles. Kids these days want to look and feel like these influencers and are shunning the sugary high cal drinks and going after 0 cal, 0 sugar replacements or ""fat burning"" energy drinks. La Croix is leading the way in this sparkling zero calorie water category - it is pretty much agua. They hardly advertise, and the likes of Coke and Pepsi can't even fucking catch up; it's remarkable.

https://preview.redd.it/yv4hrn0vm6f71.jpg?width=992&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=068c1050cff81d97e2a6242851ca9973c2ee671b

If you do drink La Croix, you'll have noticed that they are now putting out new flavors all the time - addressing my main beef with them in the last couple years of having a generally weak and limited flavor rotation. Also, (**potential** **catalyst alert**) **if and when FIZZ makes the leap into alcoholic beverages** and produces a La Croix seltzer??? Prepare for liftoff.

# Financials

FIZZ has strong financials, excellent margins, an optimistic growth outlook, and very low levels of debt to boot. Here are some key stats:

**Forward P/E**: 23 (compare to Monster Energy @ 35 and Coke @ 25)

**PEG (higher means more overvalued)**: 2.85 (MNST @ 3.66 KO @ 2.85)

**ROE - return on equity** (I like this one because it shows how effective management is generating profits based on total shareholder equity): 43% (MNST @ 31% and KO @ 37%) - worth noting all of these are fantastic given that the S&P averages somewhere around 15%

Generally speaking, FIZZ is undervalued relative to some of the other major players in the beverage market. The most surprising part is the level of short interest based on these fundamentals alone. And no, i'm not saying this is a short squeeze opportunity, however that doesn't mean that is not a potential catalyst.

# Acquisition?

(**Potential catalyst alert)** I don't know if there is a ton of precedent as to what happens when someone (an 85 year old at that) owns the vast majority of a publicly traded company. All I am saying is that the big players have been chasing this sparkling water juggernaut for years. Coke seems to have chosen their horse with Topo Chico, but would not be surprised to see another player enter the ring in a bid to take over this company with huge upside potential. **This one just screams acquisition or LBO to me**. Buyouts = premium.

# Technical Analysis

I do think there is some value in looking at the charts from a purely technical standpoint. Given that most trading is done by algorithms now, we have seen a deep downwards channel that has been in place since the January FIZZ squeeze. **This is despite the fact that FIZZ continues to beat earnings and operate with healthy metrics and growth prospects.**

So, this strikes me as an **either/or** scenario (without any other catalyst) - they will continue to track this downwards channel through the $43 relative bottom (abandon ship if this occurs), or they will reverse the trend and break back up to 50. MACD looks good for the first time in a couple months. FIZZ is in desperate need of some news that attracts attention and volume. Here is a chart with lines - bitches love lines:

8/3/21 15:35,"Chip Shortage? How about Chip GUH https://fortune.com/2021/08/03/chip-global-shortage-glut-semiconductor-supply/

Long story short, these are the plans for 2030:

- US is dedicating $52 Billion into increased chip capacity

- EU is dedicating $160 Billion into increased chip capacity

- South Korea is dedicating $450 Billion into increased chip capacity

> In June, analysts at consultancy Bain & Company said building capacity would “hurt the economics” of suppliers, since each will likely run production lines below capacity once demand abates.

It’s generally accepted that chip manufacturing facilities take years to bring operations up to rate, and the concern is that these particularly long break even periods will be extended even further if global capacity increases simultaneously.

Obviously this bodes well for companies where chips represent a substantial portion of finished product costs (such as AMD), but I am too uncaffeinated to make an educated guess as to what else will happen. Will chip manufacturers have to sell off assets when supply exceeds demand? Will there be piles of semiconductors stuffed in every kitchen drawer in the world? Will Dad ever acknowledge me? The world may never know.

What we do know is that chip shortages are going to be happening for a while, till they aren’t. Plan accordingly.
