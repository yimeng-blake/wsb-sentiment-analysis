‚ÄúIn the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have  put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC,  and other securities,‚Äù a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch,  referring to the ticker symbols of the companies. ‚ÄúWe made these  decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market  conditions and other factors.‚Äù

It is unclear to me at this point what ""some transactions"" means. Large transactions? Derivates on the stock? Buy orders in general?

If what is written in this article is true, the ""technical difficulties"" that some brokerages were stating yesterday evening are questionable. Maybe someone should read the terms of agreement of TD their TD Ameritrade account and comment if they are allowed to do this. Maybe some SEC rule aplies instead, I am not familiar with this yet.

A Question for today when markets are open:

\- Who is experiencing trading restrictions?

And for the whole community?

\- Are there alternatives?

So shorting well more of stock float, maybe even naked if done so, is ok for institutions, but buying a lot of stock in a collective is not ok. All of this while brokers usually make a lot of money from retail investors trading risky options / derivates, which also result in individuals losing it all.

Also, a boatload of memes, ""can't stop, won't stop, Gamestop"" quotes, and if awards were a stock they would be spiking in value due to this subreddit. 

Inevitably there will be a movie and more of the truth will come out that this is a random group of retail investors and that hedge funds are the ones who should be investigated by the SEC for decades of privately sharing information and swaying the market with their price targets and interviews on the news. 

Not only are us retail investors curtailed on various platforms on when we can trade and what types of trades we execute pre/post market there is already information asymmetry with the information hedge funds with deep pockets can pay for and what we have access to. Yet somehow, sharing information publicly where even hedge funds can view it is seen by these delinquents as ""unfair"". I call bull and also call a Netflix movie on all this!

But first things first. Good job with GME! Those bastards at Melvin and Citron don't deserve the title of Gay Bear. They spew lies and spread propaganda in order to decimate companies, and now it looks like GameStop is on the way to completely revolutionize their business model all thanks to you!

Now back to my commie bullshit.

While you autists have been hyperfixated on GME, the rest of the market decided to take a dump. SPY broke a bound it's been holding on to since last November. Also, the Pring's Special K indicator is closely approaching a lower bound. If you don't trust this indicator, I can assure you that I have done lots of Special K (the hose tranquilizing kind) when a flying midget told me that I can trust it. 

Now that you know it's real, it's time to wildly speculate on why the market would react like this. First of all, if anyone hates commies  more than you, it's hedge fund managers and market movers. They think that communism is when the government takes away their money and gives it to ingrates like you. What a bunch of idiots. 

Now that they think you're basically worse than china, they would rather bring down the whole system out of spite than to acknowledge that you've won.

Also, remember that the orange haired troll printed off money wherever his micropenis pointed to, and now the senile hair sniffer is worried about something called a ""deficit"" whatever the fuck that is. 

So with that, if SPY doesn't recover tomorrow I'm going to drop whatever I've been holding on to and go balls deep on GME, BB, and AMC calls.

1/28/21 14:12,"Why $NOK won't squeeze and why it may be manipulation Disclaimer: This is not investment advice, I am retarded also and have 1/29 $5P and $4.5P on $NOK because I am not retarded and I understand basic market dynamics and I want free money. I am not advocating any plays.

Yeah bagholders, shills, and hedge fund bots I know you won't like this post but shut the fuck up and Ill try to save you some money and explain the bullshit as to why this stock has been shilled. Out of random this stock gets pumped up by new accounts saying its the next short squeeze. Lets take a look at it and compare it to the other short squeezes, $GME and $AMC.

# Short Interest (SI) Potential

Its no secret now why some weird market forces are acting on $GME and $AMC because of forced buying due to a short squeeze. In order to trigger a short squeeze you need huge short positions to trigger the forced buying after a price increase. If you need more than that to know what i mean look up a youtube video im not gonna hold your hand, put your big boy pants and learn it yourself smooth brain. GME has the retardedly high level of 140% (which is illegal) causing insane forced buying spiking it 6,700% from its pre-squeeze levels [source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME). $AMC has about 37% SI and has squeezed about 500% since pre squeeze level [source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC&ty=c&ta=1&p=d). Those market forces that caused those movements are not present in $NOK. **$NOK has a paltry, pitiful, incredibly low SI of 0.94%**[source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=nok&ty=c&ta=1&p=d) **!** There won't be that forced buying pressure from shorts being forced to close out.

# Gamma Squeeze potential

Okay you're still not convinced whatever fuck you read this too. If you don't know what a gamma squeeze look that shit up it isn't that hard to grasp and i'm not you dad so teach yourself. Today an insane amount of call options traded on them, sure, but that won't affect the price much. All call option open interest is 934,240 at close, which is just 93M shares worth underlying. Even if MM's are forced to buy shares because they are selling naked there are **5.6B shares outstanding on NOK.** Even if all those calls are naked (most probably aren't) then that's only 93,424,000 shares they have to purchase which is about 1.5% of shares outstanding [source](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NOK/options) if you look at the 1/29 call options. They could close those out so quickly and at no real price increase because there's no forced buying from shorts.

# Daily Volume

Okay bag holder you're impressed they traded over 1B shares today which is a record for NOK. That matters less than your basketball games did to your dad. That 1B share volume is less than 20% than shares outstanding, but today GME did 150% and AMC did 1200% so its nowhere even close in relative trading volume to the big boys. 1B seems big but it really aint in this context.

# Valuation

Yeah some of you have no idea what i said above and may never but before you go back to drooling on your keyboard lets take a look at valuations real quick. Before GME squeezed it had a Market cap of about 300M, and AMC had Market Cap of 600M. NOK is sitting at a 35B Market cap right now, it is many many magnitudes larger than those two. its not a small cap fallen from grace it is still a large cap stock. A large cap stock is a stock over 10B is it is 3.5x the minimum of a large cap, not punt GME or AMC.

# ""Its a 5G play""

yeah sure it is to some point, but the market knows everything about it already. It didn't come out with a new product, service, get a new PT or anything else. Its not 50% better than it was a few days ago on now news. Sure it may have been relatively undervalued but it went up 40% today and nothing is new. Im not saying it‚Äôs a dead company either just that it‚Äôs worth 35 fucking billion dollars already 

# Summary

This isn't a stock to buy to punish the hedge funds. All your calls are doing is handing free premium money to them and buying their shares at insane valuations.

# What do I think it is?

Who the fuck knows why so many pumpers are out there on this stock. Maybe some are hedge fund bots, maybe they have a record number of bagholders, maybe its people who love buying on the ""greater fool theory"". I don't know but what i do know is that its not the rocket ship a bunch of virgins are saying it is. All you're doing is buying hedge fund douchebag their 3rd wife's boob job and a new yacht to fuck them in.

1/29/21 01:01,"I think Robinhood will take the fall for the GME squeeze **mods please dont delete this.**



TLDR: Robinhood will be the fall guy for the GME squeeze.


My prediction:


Robinhood will be the only victim of what has happened these last few days. As much as I hate to say it, the hedge funds who shorted 140% of shares will walk away without any problems just as they did in 2008. These massive hedge funds know that nothing illegal has happened on reddit or in general so trying to shut us down for market manipulation wont happen.

So how will they take their revenge? By bringing down Robinhood. I would not be surprised that Robinhood was forced to prevent retail investors from trading amc, gme, bb and nok to manipulate the market enough for these boomers to recoup some of their losses.



Why do I think this?: 


Right now, as we speak RH is prevent retail investors from buying any of these ""volatile"" shares.

We know that robinhood front runs orders so citadel and others can see retail investors moves. I am willing to bet all my tendies that RH will be the only casualty from all of this. The vast majority of us have been trading on RH. With the insane amount of volume and calls going through RH, the SEC will investigate them and determine that there was most likely wrongdoing (because naked shorts apparently are fine). 

This is not advice to withdraw the money from RH, but we know the rules dont apply to the rich and the billion (probably only million by now) dollar boomer hedge funders are out for blood. 


There have supposedely been more 100% out of money calls bought through RH than anywhere else. This alone would probably get them investigated by the SEC. But NOW they are preventing us from buying GME, BB, NOK and AMC. The MMs are trying to shake us. They are trying to cause such a drop that we sell our shares to their over leveraged boomer asses out of fear of losing our gainz. 

The hedge funds are going to try to shut RH down or severely cripple it so its harder for retail investors to ever do anything like what happened with GME ever again. 


What am I going to do about this?


I am filing a complaint with the SEC and you should too.

Not a retard was selling, Not even a boomer chub,

The shares were held with hands of diamond, In hopes that DeepF\*ckingValue was right there behind them.

The wives were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of boyfriends danced in their heads,

And Dr. Patel on his Twitter, And Chamath on the news, Holding positions and anticipating the cruise,

When out on Wall Street there arose such a ruckus, We only held stronger, to keep them from fucking us,

Away from the earth, we will fly with a flash, Now up through the clouds, dreaming of cash.

The stars on the horizon beaming with glow, Gave the luster of the tendies we began with below,

When, what to my wondering eyes should the enemy appear, But many-a-short-sellers grinning ear to ear.

With their cocky positions, so crooked and wrong, I knew in that moment it must be Citron,

More üåà than a bear, just like 2008, They‚Äôve come once again, here to manipulate,

With broadcasts and articles, screeching of fraud, They called for our takedown, but alas they were flawed.

‚ÄúNow NIO! Now NOK! Now TSLA and AMC! On PLTR, On BBBY, On EXPR and BB!

To the top of the charts! To the top of my screen! There‚Äôs only way to go! Green! Green! Green!‚Äù

For now, we must be patient, But my fellow retards, I‚Äôll leave you with this,

Tis not for the gains, nor for fame, But for those whom we will help in our Hero‚Äôs name,

Look at those short sellers and who they thought they could mock, Now all they hear is ‚Äúwe like the stock‚Äù,

It is time, remain steadfast on our journey ahead, There is little to fear, when there is no sight of red,

The stories will be legendary, of the downfall of our enemy,

And for that to thank, we have **GME**üöÄ

1/29/21 01:16,"If for some reason your broker is gay You don't have to be in just GME to make a difference.  The way this goes is if everyone buys the most heavily shorted stocks, those that are short will be forced to cover.  Now in order to shore up losses they most likely will have to sell off blue chips to rebalance how much cash to securities they have.  This is where the fun starts to happen.  Investors that are outside of the squeeze frenzy will start to see their blue chips falling due to funds closing out their short positions elsewhere.  These blue chip investors will then say hey, I'm going to take my profits, as the January rally has been good to me and it seems a downtrend is forming.  Then more selling happens.  This triggers more covering, squeezing, selling.  The only thing that will be left at the end are movie theaters and the power that the players have.  So long story short üòè--- only seek out heavily shorted stocks because that is where the money is going and it will be.  First draft pick outside AMC and GME is..... SKT 50% short float with about a 1bil market cap.

A message to all of the people that had a couple of acorns to invest and decided to throw it all on GME because they had nothing else to lose, and saw a beacon of hope on this subreddit.
The sense of community here that allowed this to happen was formed on financial freedom, something that is near impossible to achieve during a world pandemic for someone that doesn‚Äôt have fund already. Hell, people that started this pandemic with funds are still losing.

A stimulus check that doesn‚Äôt even cover one months worth of expenses is asking the BARE FUCKING MINIMUM.

The 1% has no idea how it feels to be backed into a corner. Until now. And this is how they respond. The 1% ‚Äî whose wealth has grown at an amount that is equal to the amount of wealth LOST by the lower-classes ‚Äî are not only giving us an insulting amount of money to live off of, but are ACTIVELY suppressing a community of people who found a WAY to PROSPERITY!

**What Happened**: With [heavily shorted stocks](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/01/19346393/amc-national-beverage-and-8-more-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-watch) and their subsequent squeezes all the rage these days, WSB is drawing a crowd and with a crowd comes ideas ‚Äì some credible, some not so much.

Time will tell what comes of this notion, but one Redditor is suggesting [a Hunt Brothers redux](https://priceonomics.com/how-the-hunt-brothers-cornered-the-silver-market/), advocating for going after the silver market.

‚ÄúSilver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth. Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC,‚Äù [according to a Wednesday WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/). ‚ÄúWe know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation. Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.‚Äù

**Why It's Important**: Again, it remains to be seen what comes of this, but if the WSB crowd can affect the price of silver, various exchange-traded funds stand to benefit, namely the **iShares Silver Trust** (NYSE:[SLV](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-slv)) and the **Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF** (NYSE:[SIVR](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-sivr)).

Both of those ETFs are backed by physical holdings of the white metal.

‚ÄúInflation adjusted Silver should be at 1000$ instead of 25$. Link to post removed by mods. Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price,‚Äù according to the Reddit post. ‚ÄúThink about the Gainz. If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you'd be destroying along the way.‚Äù

That reference to **JPMorgan Chase** (NYSE:[JPM](https://www.webull.com/quote/nyse-jpm)) pertains to the [bank's alleged manipulation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-05/jpmorgan-s-role-in-metals-spoofing-is-under-u-s-criminal-probe) of the silver market.

**What's Next**: The Reddit post garnered 2,700 comments with plenty of WSB community advocating for the idea of cornering the silver market. Some like the idea of getting vengeance on JPMorgan for depressing their silver investments.",3696,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.806393325,True

1/29/21 01:17,"Short Sellers: You Only Have Yourselves to Blame Hi Shorts,

You guys really need to stop acting like the millions of everyday retail investors who bought GME, AMC, and others are evil monsters. 

Because the fact remains that what happened this week was ENTIRELY YOUR OWN FAULT.

FIRST: 
What kind of insane idiots short a stock 138%. 

Really guys? 

That is like eating a sandwich and then saying ""Fuck it"" and then proceeding to eat your own hand because it was nearby. 

How many stocks are there out there? You could've shorted any other stock. 

But noooo lets keep shorting GME. 

This is your fault.

SECOND: 
How many fucking warnings did you need? 

WSB is not some secret cabal of anarchists. It's a fucking public message board used by millions of average ordinary people. Literally ANYONE could go on reddit and see that people have been talking about how GME was undervalued and over shorted since LAST MARCH. 

But did you guys close your positions then? 

Nope. 

What about when Ryan Cohen wrote his letter to the board? 

Or when he joined the board? 

Or any of the hundreds of moments over the last year discussed ad nauseum on this board? 

Did you close your positions then? 

Nope.

If this stock had not been shorted to the depths of Hades would the stock still have been undervalued? 

Yes. 

Would it have shot up to $300? 

No.

GME would‚Äôve still been a great investment, and buying at $3 would‚Äôve yielded a 10x return. 

Baller.

But you idiots shorted that thing to the core of the god damn earth.

So if you are looking for someone to blame, go to the bathroom and look in the mirror you use to apply your clown make-up in the morning. 

That person in the mirror is who to blame.

If you are looking for the government to create legislation to prevent this from happening again, that legislation should make institutional short selling illegal.

The short sellers are the monsters.

Stop gambling with people‚Äôs retirement funds. 

If they wanted to gamble they would be here on WSB scouring memes for stock tips.

IN SUMMATION:

Fuck the shorts. 

You guys are and have been irresponsible, malicious, and smug. 

You have made your own bed.

1/29/21 01:22,"MODS, DO NOT DELETE! CLEVELAND, Jan. 28, 2021 -- The securities arbitration and class action law firm of ChapmanAlbin LLC announced today that it is investigating claims on behalf of Robinhood users that were affected and suffered losses as a result of investing in Gamestop or AMC through the Robinhood brokerage platform.
‚ÄúJust a month ago, the Massachusetts securities regulators filed a lawsuit against Robinhood for aggressive, dishonest marketing practices geared toward inexperienced investors,‚Äù says Philip Vujanov, an attorney at ChapmanAlbin. ‚ÄúNow, Robinhood appears to be up to the same old tricks, recruiting social media influencers to encourage individuals to sign up and fund a Robinhood account and beginning purchasing shares of securities such as Gamestop and AMC, with no consideration as to the suitability of the purchases. To make matters worse, Robinhood proceeded to place trading restrictions on the securities just a day later.‚Äù
ChapmanAlbin has helped investors, worldwide, recover millions of dollars in savings invested in fraudulent investment schemes or lost due to the misconduct of broker-dealers or financial advisors.

1/29/21 01:24,"IMPORTANT: HOW CITADEL, KEN GRIFFIN AND RH ARE COLLUDING TO TANK GME, AMC, BB ET ALL Ok so this was brought to my attention via Portnoy's DDTG morning stream.  He mentioned that the hedge fund Citadel, and their manager Kenneth Griffin might be behind the delisting of GME, BB and AMC.  Hmmm, Citadel, that name sound familiar??? [Well that's because they are one of the funds that helped to bail out melvin capital](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340).  

But why would robinhood cave to their demands? Well a quick google search will bring up these quotes from following articles (you may get paywalled on FT) :

**FinancialTimes:** [Zero-fee trading helps Citadel Securities cash in on retail boom](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b) 

Emphasis mine:

""Robinhood‚Äôs revenues from equities and options order flow came to **$91m for the period, with $39m from Citadel Securities**. In the past, the company paid to settle charges with Finra, the US regulator, for failing to properly monitor trades sent to market makers.""

**Fortune:** [Robinhood makes millions selling your stock trades ‚Ä¶ is that so wrong?](https://fortune.com/2020/07/08/robinhood-makes-millions-selling-your-stock-trades-is-that-so-wrong/)

""For example, when you buy a share of Tesla on your phone, Robinhood sends that order to a trading giant like Citadel Securities and receives a few pennies in return‚Äîthe PFOF. Citadel, meanwhile, completes your trade and makes a few pennies itself...For Robinhood, those pennies add up. A recent SEC filing, first cited by The Block, reveals Citadel Securities and a handful of other firms paid Robinhood nearly $100 million in the first quarter of 2020 alone.""

**So what does this all mean?**
Clearly, citadel has a financial interest in the GME squeeze, and stand to lose all of their injection into Melvin if we keep going (HOLD HOLD HOLD).  On the flip side, they have been paying RH significant sums to complete their trades, with up to 42% of RH's income according to that FT article.  

Its not hard to connect the dots from there. Ol Boy Ken Griffin made a call to RH and told them to shut this shit down OR ELSE.  THIS IS BLATANT MANIPULATION!!! FILE COMPLAINTS WITH THE SEC, TWEET ABOUT IT, SHOUT IT FROM THE FUCKING ROOFTOPS!!

1/29/21 01:40,"IT'S WORKING: Several Hedge Funds Stung by Market Turmoil More hedge funds are being hit by losses o the recent market turmoil. Traders say the pain that has afflicted top hedge funds Melvin Capital Management and Maplelane Capital in recent days is spreading, as an increasing number of stocks with significant short interest surge and as funds dealing with losses pull back their exposure to the stock market on both the long and short sides of their portfolios. That means funds are getting hurt even on previously profitable bets on companies as those share prices fall. Candlestick Capital Management, a roughly $3 billion Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund started by former Citadel portfolio manager Jack Woodruff, was down in the low-to-mid-teens for the year through Wednesday, said a person familiar with the fund. It was up 26% in 2020, its first year.  

D1 Capital Partners, a top-performing fund in recent years founded by former Viking Global investment chief Dan Sundheim, was down about 20% for the year through Wednesday. Its substantial portfolio of investments in private companies has buffered the fund from a bigger loss. D1 managed $20 billion at the start of the year. Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, which together with Citadel and its partners injected $2.5 billion in emergency financing into Melvin Monday, was down about 10% for the year through earlier this week and suffered losses Tuesday and Wednesday, said people familiar with the matter.
Bloomberg News was first to report the performances of D1 Capital and Point72. Some funds that have sustained severe losses are seeking influxes of cash to help stabilize their firms.  

Maplelane, which started the year with about $3.5 billion and was down roughly 30% for the year through Tuesday, sustained additional losses that saw it down about 45% for the year through Wednesday, said people familiar with the fund. One of the people said the losses Wednesday stemmed from degrossing, or cutting back its exposure to the stock market. That included reducing position sizes and exiting names to limit losses.
Maplelane is a low-profile hedge fund that has rarely marketed to investors in the past. But it has discussed raising between $300 million and $500 million with potential clients, said people familiar with the fund. The losses have come during a period of frenetic trading, with shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. shooting wildly higher. Individual investors have claimed victory for the violent moves unmoored from the underlying fundamentals of companies. The rising prices have prompted bearish investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.

The effect of their moves to save their asses, with assistance from their friends (Robin Hood etc.) is two-fold:

1. It generates **MORE** hate towards them. This is more hate than current hate (and I just read someone's post stating he will ""die with his *teeth* clenched to their *balls*"").
2. [The Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) \- The **Streisand effect** is a social phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information has the unintended consequence of further publicizing that information, often via the Internet.  It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose attempt to suppress the California Coastal Records Project's photograph of her residence in Malibu, California, taken to document California coastal erosion, inadvertently drew further attention to it in 2003.**They are getting more attention by panicking and trying to block people.**

IMO they are ending their own companies faster and faster by inciting more hate and publicity to this instead of covering their short positions (if they even *can*, lol) or just admitting failure and going bankrupt.  


**They are going Full-Streisand.**

For anyone who isn't familiar with the dilemma you can read up more in depth [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) . But who am I kidding, we don't know how to read nor do we have the time to do so. But for the rather curios i'll try to break it down in a nutshell:

Two Criminals got caught but the there is not enough evidence to prove their wrongdoing, so the suits try to pull a trick on them, by offering each of them a deal for a lowered sentence if they betray the other guy. Both of them are isolated so they can not speak to each other and each one is told the other one gets the same deal. To put more pressure on them they also do tell them, if the other one takes the deal first, theirs will be void.

  So the outcomes are as follow:

* If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
* If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison
* If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free
* If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

&#x200B;

If you read this far, you might wonder how this relates to the current situation. Well, Robin Hood and a bunch of other Apps got on their knees to suck some cocks under the table in order to keep us away from our tendies by restricting buying but not selling of $GME, $BB and $AMC. We are now the ""prisoners"" here and by üßªü§ö we give them what they want. But if we üíéüíéü§≤ like our prophet DFV they got nothing on us and everything comes cracking down on them. Also after this little stunt i sure hope RH has invested in $ROPE cause they gonna need it.

They are strategizing to demonize you, to dismantle your communications platforms and to manipulate you with fear into believing selling is your only option. 

You need to set up a branch right now. Use tiktok to communicate, twitter, set something up. Because they can take this page offline even for a few hours to panic people into selling. 

Set up cashapps, or other investment alternatives. Bring lawsuits to robinhood for manipulation.

HOWEVER, AFTERWARDS, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO LEAVE. Every single person with an account needs to withdraw their funds and close their account. MAKE THEM SUFFER. There are plenty of other platforms who don‚Äôt crash during volatility and don‚Äôt prevent us from trading like Robinhood has. Fidelity for example is free and I think you can even import assets from another brokerage directly without selling / re-buying. Ive heard TD-Ameritrade is decent as well.

If you notice NOK, AMC and BB got sudden spikes yesterday in price with GME despite only BB is a meme on WSB and was only mentioned frequently before the GME squeeze. 

NOK,AMC,BBBY on the other hand is simply a P&D so that the MSM could say that we are squeezing stocks despite we only believe in GME and long BB

You should also look at the IB SLB rates,SLB rates are what interest rate short sellers needs to pay to short stocks.

If you notice, all stocks are not available for short sale despite you could easily do so on BB 2 days ago with 4 mil available for you to sell. But what interesting is that when robin hood and many brokers doesn't allow you to buy these tickers, the short interest rates suddenly spiked which means that there is some crazy shorting going on. 

While GME interest rate goes down mainly due to being blocked by brokers to not allow you to buy the stocks but could only sell, which lessen some short sellers pressure.

so what should you do?

Message Text:  
Hi, I am a concerned citizen (and military member) that is concerned over last couple of day's news in regards to brokerage firms restricting user's ability to place the trades they would like which currently includes companies like Gamestop, Blackberry and AMC Entertainment (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-bars-users-from-buying-game-stop-stock-infuriating-its-users-144007484.html). The brokerage firms Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers are the firms I am aware of that have restricted either sale or purchase of certain companies based on their perception of volatility and to ""mitigate risk to customers"". This is unacceptable in a free market. These companies have been pushed down to major lows based on short selling and manipulation. People who love these companies have banded together to stop the short selling and raise these stocks back to where we feel they belong and when these large, money rich firms got burned, all of a sudden the volatility is a problem. This is the very definition of market manipulation and I am asking that my representatives look into this and correct it. If the market is not truly free, as it has not been for many years, then only those with access to major wealth (much of which isn't even owned by these firms) will continue to trade in the market, and only these firms will be able to enrich themselves. Please look at this and take it seriously. I think that only legislative change can fix this injustice. 

Very respectfully, 

intellectually challenged individual.

It is a conflict of interest for Citadel to be routing orders for GME, and by Robinhood and Schwab stopping new orders for GME and AMC, they've likely broken their fiduciary duty.  The SEC should investigate why new orders were stopped.

**Order Routing**
>Order routing is the process by which an order goes from the end user to an exchange. An order may go directly to the exchange from the customer, or it may go first to a broker who then routes the order to the exchange.

>""Smart"" order routing attempts to achieve best execution of trades while minimizing market impact. It is designed to help firms in an increasingly fragmented market to search for hidden liquidity, find opportunities in dark pools and use algorithms to maximize results without moving the market.

>In stock trading, it is a common practice among brokerage firms to route orders to certain market makers, who then ""rebate"" 1 to 4 cents per share back to the brokerage firm in exchange for the directed order flow. This practice is known as ""payment for order flow"" (PFOF).

Source: http://marketswiki.com/wiki/Order_routing


**Schwab's disclosure**
>As part of a common industry practice known as Payment for Order Flow, Schwab receives rebates from liquidity providers and certain exchanges based upon the order flow executed at each destination. Some orders require us to pay associated transaction costs, but most orders result in rebates. Net rebates received by Schwab are used to offset transaction and order processing or handling costs and help us maintain very low commission rates for our clients. Rebate rates are substantially similar among the various securities exchanges and liquidity providers, although they vary based upon order characteristics (i.e., marketable vs. non-marketable).

>At Schwab we put our clients' interests first. Therefore, best execution for our clients always takes priority when determining where to route orders. Any eligible rebates from a particular market center are not a consideration in order routing decisions.

I know because I have a ROTH IRA with tasty. Tasty doesn‚Äôt allow margin on Roth‚Äôs. They sent me an email telling me I had excessive risk due to an AMC position (400 shares, -2 calls short, 2 calls long). 

I asked why and they explained that margin had increased on basically every meme stock ‚Äúto protect customers and the platform‚Äù. I asked if they were going to force liquidate and they said I would have a few hours to cough up cash, close out at a loss, or they would force liquidate.

But my Roth IRA doesn‚Äôt allow me to use margin, everything was owned directly by me. I told him this and he realized his mistake because he had been telling people who had margin accounts over and over again during the day to liquidate.

TLDR: Robinhood will be the fall guy for the GME squeeze.


My prediction:


Robinhood will be the only victim of what has happened these last few days. As much as I hate to say it, the hedge funds who shorted 140% of shares will walk away without any problems just as they did in 2008. These massive hedge funds know that nothing illegal has happened on reddit or in general so trying to shut us down for market manipulation wont happen.

So how will they take their revenge? By bringing down Robinhood. I would not be surprised that Robinhood was forced to prevent retail investors from trading amc, gme, bb and nok to manipulate the market enough for these boomers to recoup some of their losses.



Why do I think this?: 


Right now, as we speak RH is prevent retail investors from buying any of these ""volatile"" shares.

We know that robinhood front runs orders so citadel and others can see retail investors moves. I am willing to bet all my tendies that RH will be the only casualty from all of this. The vast majority of us have been trading on RH. With the insane amount of volume and calls going through RH, the SEC will investigate them and determine that there was most likely wrongdoing (because naked shorts apparently are fine). 

This is not advice to withdraw the money from RH, but we know the rules dont apply to the rich and the billion (probably only million by now) dollar boomer hedge funders are out for blood. 


There have supposedely been more 100% out of money calls bought through RH than anywhere else. This alone would probably get them investigated by the SEC. But NOW they are preventing us from buying GME, BB, NOK and AMC. The MMs are trying to shake us. They are trying to cause such a drop that we sell our shares to their over leveraged boomer asses out of fear of losing our gainz. 

The hedge funds are going to try to shut RH down or severely cripple it so its harder for retail investors to ever do anything like what happened with GME ever again.

1/29/21 02:32,"What is happening and what we should do now! What is happening right now?

Robinhood has blocked GME and AMC and it is no longer possible to buy these stocks at this point. As we have seen, it is clearly depressing the price and many traders will partially close their positions. In my opinion, this really borders on market manipulation, but that's for others to decide. Who is behind this decision, whether it is government, hedge funds or RobinHood itself, is unclear. But it clearly means that we have pissed on their leg properly and we are on the right track. There is no way this should make us give up!
They are probably trying to divide us. They want us to move away from GME and AMC and focus on other values. The goal is very likely that we will all spread our capital over several stocks and the concentration on GME will decrease. They can't succeed with this!


What will happen?

What has not been considered in this action is that this setback will only make us grow closer together and our will is stronger than before! The community has more than doubled in size in the last few days and our influence has increased as a result. We have the ability to fight back stronger than they can even imagine. As soon as RobinHood releases GME and AMC again the reaction will be very strong. Once we all find an alternative to Robinhood, we will invest there and drive the price back up.

What should we do now?

We should not sell! Through this action we see that we are doing everything right and we should not let this upset us. We need to find alternatives to continue buying GME and AMC. We could work with VPNs and thus trade via European markets and brokers or we look for alternative brokers in America that allow us to do so.
We must not let ourselves be divided! We are more users than ever before and are at our strongest at this point in time. We must use this situation to our advantage!

I would like you congratulate you on raising awareness to the greed and corruption that the suits on Wall Street dangle over us every day retail traders. They are constantly manipulating the markets to suit their agenda and their wallets. They thought that we were a merry band of fools from whom they could syphon money. 

We have proven them wrong in the past few weeks. We have shown them that 4.7 Million of us can unite strong to prevail over the hedge funds and cause them to lose billions of dollars. Now, soon, we must determine our way forward. 

There are 4.7M degenerates here, many came clamoring for community and a place to gamble away the pennies earned when sports were taken from us almost a year ago. Most have come in the past few weeks looking to participate in the greatest outcry of the people against financial institutions of all time.

We must now join together to continue to help the little man. Let us go forth having delivered a heavy blow and take our tendies to reinvest them in the small companies that have good and strong fundamentals that have yet to be noticed. That deserve a few shekels to grow. We have taken from the rich and the greedy despite the ironic betrayal by Robinhood, now let us continue to invest in those that truly need it.

No further acceptance of buy orders for certain stocks

&#x200B;

As you may have noticed, there is currently increased buying and extremely high volatility in normally less liquid stocks. At Trade Republic, we believe in markets and their power to regulate themselves. In the last few days, however, an unprecedented situation has arisen: According to press reports, the shares GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Inc., BlackBerry Limited, Nokia Corp., Express Inc. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. are apparently currently the subject of violent, coordinated shares Price speculation. Due to the associated risks for you, we are not accepting any new orders to buy these shares until further notice.  


TLDR: German Broker Trade Republic equivalent to Robinhood bans buyorders for certain stocks.

TLDR: Stocks work like this: if there are more buyers than sellers, the price goes up. Your precious stocks are dropping like a sorority girl's panties because Robinhood, etc. are BLOCKING buyers. Therefore there are more sellers than buyers the price is going down. Red stocks = panic and the average noobie will use their only option -sell. What they're doing is outright disgusting, illegal, fraudulent, and shocking even by scumbag wall street standards. Once they open up, they are betting that you were scared away enough to not buy so that their hedge fund butt buddies can escape from losing all their yachts and mansions.

This will be decently long but I promise it will be worth your time. We will be covering WHY the stocks are tanking, short sales, naked options, short squeeze, HOW CLOSE we are to breaking the hedge funds and the other buzzwords you've been seeing. Ok, so you bought GME, AMC, NOK, BB after seeing this historic run. Now, you're watching your savings dwindle away in large chunks, you can't buy anymore to support the really and you're panicking. THATS OK! Please read:

&#x200B;

To understand why we have such a critical role in what is going on here, you need to understand how shorting and naked option sales function. Essentially, shorts are a loan. The loan is not paid back in dollars like a mortgage, but rather it is paid back in SHARES! I.E. - you short Tesla at $800. the firm gives you $800 cash, now you owe them 1 share. If 1 share of Tesla goes down to $700, you buy that share and return it to the firm, making a $100 difference on the $800 you paid vs. the $700 you bought it back for. Simple enough? Great, lets continue.

&#x200B;

Options give you the ability to buy/sell 100 shares of stock at a certain price, at a certain time. Options ARE NOT stocks, think of options as a ""side bet"" or ""prop bet"". They're nothing more than a piece of paper. Like any market, there are buyers and there are sellers. When you buy an option you pay a fee known as the ""premium"" and expect the stock to go up or down. On the other side, is the person who sold you the option and RECEIVES the ""premium. The seller makes money when the stock does not hit that agreed upon price. To make this simple, lets say you own 100 shares of Apple (remember options are worth 100 shares). You think Apple will stay below $150. You ""sell"" a call option and someone who believes Apple will go to $150 pays you $100 for the contract. If Apple stays below $150, you just made $100, if Apple goes to $150, you now owe the option buyer your 100 shares of Apple, but you keep the $100 he paid you.

&#x200B;

Ok, if you made it this far thanks, now here's where shit gets juicy. Using the scenario about Apple, lets say you don't own 100 shares, lets say you were a greedy cocksucker like Melvin Capital and SOLD billions of dollars of options WITHOUT owning the proper amount of stock to cover your ass. Well fuck,  now you owe millions of shares for this loan and the price of the stock is now 2,000% higher than what you sold them for. You owed $34,000,000 in December, now $7,650,000,000 because some autists decided to put you out of business. This is ""naked selling"" and this is the crux of why these cocksuckers and trying to suppress buying. The ""short squeeze"" occurs when these firms panic and start buying shares to cover their loans, making the stock go higher, making more shorts buy shares to cover their loans. It's a snowball effect. The shorts owe a lot of these shares on Friday, which is why its no surprise that Thursday, these brokerage firms decided to shut you down. Congrats, Robinhood, et al. saved Melvin and their hedge fund scumbag friends from losing billions and billions of dollars.

&#x200B;

So, DO NOT BE SCARED. STAY STRONG AND WHEN THE BROKERAGES OPEN BACK UP BUYERS WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE MARKET AGAIN SENDING THE STOCK HIGHER.  I WILL NOT BE BULLIED AROUND BY BILLIONAIRES ON YACHTS AND THEIR FRIENDS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AVERAGE JOE. VIVA u/DeepFuckingValue AND VIVA WSB.",13616,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.992133737,True

I need to understand how at a fundamental (since everyone wants to put pressure on the meaning of that word) level is is okay to essentially shut down either the supply or demand side of a particular security or market. 

Doesn‚Äôt the free market by definition have to have an endless struggle between these two things. Buying and selling. 

Trading requires this shit to be a two way street. I‚Äôm not trying to collect stocks for a hobby. I‚Äôm trying to find efficiencies that can make me money. I thought that was the point. 

Pausing things is annoying but understandable. I get that it could be harmful to allow a stock to have infinite volatility. Those types of corrections I support and nudging the market is a valuable tool. 

This vlad dude was on yahoo finance which I watch on a free Samsun TV plus channel from my very modest and regular home that I owe well over 150k on. He was in a mansion. He was talking about how he supported the ability to democratize the market and all of that. 

I wake up and he shut off my ability to fight back. Cool democracy. 

I have seen a flood of gains posts. So many. I haven‚Äôt seen a single selfish use of the gains. I‚Äôm sure they are there but I see way more things like

‚ÄúI bought my mom her house and now she can take it easy‚Äù

‚ÄúMy sister can get treatment for Lyme‚Äôs disease finally‚Äù

‚ÄúJust donated to charity!‚Äù 

We have been waiting on a government that abandoned us for the most part during this whole pandemic. We have watched bail out after bailout for Wall Street when they fuck their risk models. 

We said fuck it and are doing our own stimulus. We are taking the money from people who were fueled by greed and wanted to take and easy shot and snuff out GME, AMC, etc.

I intend to sign up for every petition/lawsuit assuming they are initiated. 

I am also going to hold the fuck out of these stocks.  

It is simple I like Cohen. He successfully executed the same company that popped the dot com bubble. Pets.com. To think that a guy that could bring the dog food store to your house is going to fail at getting video games to players while operating with possibly lower retail space overhead is something I can‚Äôt wrap my head around. Long hold on this for me. I feel like there are endless plays that are ready to implement when shifting a business from physical to virtual. 

AMC is cool because I want to fucking see a movie and there isn‚Äôt going to be a place for that other than my couch and I have already burned through couch this year because I‚Äôm always on it. 

You heard that right. I put like 5 years on my couch this year. I have seen tiger king and Tesla splits and riots and insurrections from my couch. I‚Äôm over it and would like to have a reason to put on a clean shirt and use my legs long enough to buy a tub of cabs and oil and sit in an unfamiliar space with strangers.

It is what it is man. I also don‚Äôt see how Hollywood which is American as Hollywood would be able to deal with losing the way they reach people. Some things are fun because they remind us of better times.

Preventing us from selling certain stocks is beyond bullshit. This seems  criminal. How much money are people losing right now because of this,  and how much are the hedges saving right now? I'm here to say that it's  time we all stop using RH. It's garbage. I have been using Ameritrade  for a while as well, and it is an excellent alternative. Some  transactions have $0 fees, and the most I've paid on a trade is $6 at  this point. Well worth the price to not have to deal with RH fuckery  like this ever again. Super easy to set up an account and you can  transfer funds and start trading right away. Their app is cool too.  Consider this or another platform. Even saw you can buy stock on Cashapp  now. RH has fucked us after making bank off all of our transactions.  It's time for them to face a reckoning. They aren't the only game in  town and it seems like they need to be reminded of that. I'm buying in  on Ameritrade and then  closing my RH positions when profitable and  closing my account. Seriously, fuck these assclowns. Get set up on  another platform, hitch a ride to the lunar surface, and wave a finger  back at RH for pulling this. Hoping this will have disastrous effects on  the upcoing RH IPO. Fuck them.

This is pile of steaming dog-shit, we all know these brokers are profiting by sucking off Melvin Capital, Citadel, and others that are short on these stocks. They think that just because we're ordinary people that we will be docile and not do shit? Well this is how I think we get some revenge and payback: **ALL OF US NEED TO SWITCH BROKERS AND LEAVE THESE COWARDS**.

We have given them too many chances to fix their shit, especially when this is probably the 7th or 8th time people have had issues with both of these platforms. Yes Robinhood is commission free trading for options and stocks, but you literally get what you pay for, which is jack shit. Even though you have to pay .65 cents per option at TD, we are paying to get fucked in the ass. I simply have had enough of this shit. There are many consistent brokers out there but the one I have experience with that I recommend is Fidelity. The reasoning is simple, with Fidelity I have had fills on my options and stocks that were better than the mid prices (RH and TD never gave me better prices) so they actually care about giving their clients competitive fills, they provide first-class research for free when you open an account, they give FREE LEVEL 2 QUOTES and time and sales, and they actually have a goddamn support number to call if you have any issues. Now you do have to pay .65 cents/contract at Fidelity for options (stocks are free) but c'mon for all of the features above Fidelity is clearly more competitive than TD and RH combined, not to mention I am able to buy GME options and shares in my IRA while I can't do that in my accounts with RH and TD. And before you call me a Fidelity shill, I only have a 2 year old IRA account with Fidelity versus about 100k combined in RH and TD, but after all this shit these brokers have given me, I've had enough, I'm going to transfer all my options and stocks to Fidelity.

**NOTE:** I recommended Fidelity, but please post other brokers y'all have used that actually give a shit about their clients and have let you trade GME today.

**TLDR:** **FUCK TD AMERITADE AND ROBINHOOD**. We can have our revenge by taking our order flow to a broker that actually cares for us like Fidelity or others that people might mention below. ALSO **DO NOT SELL GME!!!!!!!**

On the morning of 1/28/2021, Robinhood Markets, Inc, a popular online brokerage favored by retail investors, removed the ability to purchase certain securities such as GameStop ($GME) and AMC ($AMC). This is defined as prohibited conduct as defined by Finra (1. #13), and can be considered under the umbrella term of ""market manipulation"". Robinhood removed the ability to purchase these stocks because one of their partners, Citadel Securities (2), a powerful hedge fund and market maker, was losing billions of dollars from those stocks, and preventing the ability for retail investors to purchase more shares would help them save money. Billionaires and Hedge Funds like Citadel have been profiting off of hard working Americans for years, and them colluding to shut down trading of GameStop just because they are the ones losing money is absolutely disgraceful.  Robinhood has claimed that ""they want to protect investors from losing money in times of volitility"", but that reasoning is a lie. They did that because Citadel told them too. Congresswoman Tlaib has shown her concern (3), and I hope you join her in requesting a hearing from Robinhood and Citadel.

1/29/21 03:29,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) - do retail investors understand market cap? Just wondering why stocks like NOK, AMC, etc received so much attention when the #2 most shorted stock - LGND, with a short interest currently over 100% - has received almost no attention here or in the media. This is a solid biotech/pharmaceutical company with positive cash flow and a healthy balance sheet. Unlike brick and mortar stores and movie theaters, there is nothing outdated or inherently flawed with this biotech company's business model.

As far as I can tell, the only reason this stock is so heavily shorted is because of a hit piece put out by WSB's mortal enemy Citron back in 2019. Of course, we know that once these short sellers smell blood in the water they pile on, making bearish sentiment a self-fulfilling prophecy. The current short positions seem to be based on his outdated thesis. His price target was $35 and LGND is now sitting pretty comfortably over $120. In other words, he was once again dead wrong with his predictions. 

So why hasn't this stock received the attention that other heavily shorted stocks like NOK, AMC, etc have in the past few days? 

My hunch is that retail investors look only at the share price and not market cap. **LGND may cost $100+ per share but the market cap is only 2.65B. That is around what Gamestop's was before it received widespread attention as a short-busting target.** 

Unlike GME, NOK, AMC, BB, etc. LGND is not blocked by any of the brokers. I'm not selling any of my position in GME but I'm definitely giving this stock some of my attention going forward.

Here's the deal. As others have stated Robinhood turns out to be the Sheriff of Nottingham. So, fuck 'em. 

Open another brokerage account. I'm choosing TD. If I do a wire transfer I'll have the money with-in the day (and probably in less than an hour).

Once your funds clear in the new spot, close EVERYTHING OUT in RH.. Yes, I'm talking about GME, AMC, BB, etc.. everything. Now I hear you shouting me down from the back about diamond hands, and I got you!

Once your funds in your new account have cleared, buy your positions in RH and then close those positions in RH. You won't take any personal loss/gain but you may realize a loss/gain in RH. This will only change things slightly at tax time. I know you can't do math, so I'll help you out.

GME Buy: $82.66  
Sell in RH to GTFO: $$277.59  
Buy in TD: $277.59\*  
Sell after the infinity squeeze: $4200.69!

As you can see the 2 middle trades cancel each other. Now you probably won't be able to fill at the exact same price because GME is volatile as fuck. But that may work to your benefit even. But if you do them at basically the same time the difference will be minimal. 

If people wait to close their accounts till next week, or 2 weeks or a month from now, Robinhood will not get the message TODAY that they can't just change the rules. We've become a more united entity, let's show them we won't be fucked with!

Now go make your wife's bf a sandwich!

Because my risk tolerance on the few thousand dollars I threw at this thing is literally higher than If I were in vegas. I would literally rather see all of that money disappear than pull it out now. I'm either sailing this ship into valhalla or going down with it.

Do you know what the risk tolerance is for Melvin Capital, Citron, Citadel, etc is? Extremely low. Those fucking morons stand lose money for a bunch of billionaires and millionaires, lose their entire elevated status that they've enjoyed for years, lose their rights to trade with the privileges that they enjoy; and yet with that very clear motivation that they should have sensible risk tolerance, they leveraged themselves 10:1 into a short borrowing a stock into 140% of the float. Those morons are on the low ground in this duel, not us. WE ARE NOT FUCKING SELLING AND THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO BUY.

As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.

&#x200B;

P.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.

Public, Stash, and Webull have said it is because their clearing broker, Apex Clearing told them too. Note Robinhood uses its own clearing broker now, Robinhood Securities. It left Apex in 2018. Some, like TD Ameritrade, do self-clearing. Although TDA also uses a separate, affiliated clearing broker similar to Robinhood in addition to self-clearing.

The clearing brokers are not the end of the chain. They route orders to market makers who can internalize the order (take the other side) or send it to an exchange.

It goes like this:

Retail customer places order -> Retail Broker -> Clearing Broker -> Market Maker -> 1) Internalize or 2) Exchange.

SEC Rule 606 requires all broker-dealers to report the % they route they orders to and their routing policies. For example, for September 2020 nonS&P500 (aka GME, among others) orders, Robinhood routed between 38% and 65% of its various order types (market, limit, etc) to Citadel.

[https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

TD Ameritrade and its affiliate clearing broker sends up to 40% of orders to CITADEL.

[https://www.tdameritrade.com/disclosure.page](https://www.tdameritrade.com/disclosure.page)

It's well reported that Citadel and Point72 backed up Melvin Capital on their short GME position. (Note Citadel is actually multiple companies, including the asset management company then the market making company. I'm not sure which company actually loaned money for the shorts. Wiki says the market maker is a subsidiary of the asset management company).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel\_LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC)

So this is unconfirmed speculation at this point, but is it possible Citadel told all the clearing brokers routing to it to halt buying or it would withdraw it's business? If so, that seems like clear market manipulation, especially given its interest in the short positions of Melvin.

Even so, why would it matter? Other market makers like Virtu Americas should be able to step in and take the order-flow business that Citadel won't... right?

Can anybody with time on their hands pull the Rule 606 disclosure reports for all the retail and clearing brokers and make a map to see who is involved? Then see what hedge funds are related to the various market makers? Who are the other shorts? I've only seen Melvin and Citron, but they don't have the entire short position on GME do they? The coordinated shutdown of retail buyers today certainly seems like collusion.

1/29/21 12:13,"The bullish case for Tanger Outlets (SKT) After witnessing the GME explosion, I went looking last week for other stocks with high short %, and ideally low volume.  One in particular stood out to me -- SKT, Tanger Outlets.

[The average volume over the past 3 months is 3.55m](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/key-statistics?p=SKT), and has been slowly building -- the avg volume over the past 10 days is 10.82m, so some scouting and positioning has clearly already been done.  

The float for this stock is only 89.64m shares.  That's way less than other recent meme stocks like NOK (5.6 **billion**), BB (508 million), and comparable to AMC (102m).  

Given that AMC has a similar float, I then checked out the short % of the float -- for SKT it's **75.26%**.  AMC is 38.12%.

Furthering the case for SKT, [the open interest in puts has been dropping drastically](https://twitter.com/TeresaTrades/status/1354865732748599296/photo/1).  4th largest OI put decrease.

SKT recently reinstated their dividend, and being a dividend/real estate stock, this seems to be one that is safer to hold, and that current holders are less likely to try to exit on a pop.  I live right near one of their outlets, and you wouldn't think we were in a pandemic with all the traffic it has.  Even if malls begin to shutter their stores, outlet stores generally stay open as the stores relocate their inventory to the outlets for clearance, figuring bargain hunters will go scoop them up.

At the start of this year, a new CEO was installed - Stephen Yalof, who previously headed up Simon Property Group (SPG).  He was CEO of SPG starting July 2014, when SPG stock was at 168.19, and hit a high of 227 a few years later.  He ended up departing SPG in April 2020, obviously after the pandemic/crash.

TL;DR This fight is bigger than GME it‚Äôs now a fight against all shorts, so not only GME should be our main focus... all heavily shorted stocks should be in our focus! AMC, BB, PLTR, NOK   ALL SHORTED STOCK MATTERS

Position : sitting on 5 GME shares and 385 AMC 

What they did today was criminal and people must go to jail for this.

I understand our biggest focus must be GME however I believe Wallstreet will get out of GME short because they know it‚Äôs the most memed stock and they will likely target other easy prey like AMC, nok and BB (there are more) 

We need mega tread for all the main shorted stock to share DD and strategy to win this fight against the institutions and the shorts! GME IS ONE BATTLEFIELD but the WAR MUST BE WON EVERYwhere

I mean GME is the main event the main banner but this fight is bigger than GME it‚Äôs WSB against wall street shorts, institutional power that refuse that retail can win without them! 

Thanks for hearing me out! Hopefully you guys don‚Äôt downvote me to urANUS because a lot believe anything other than GME is bad and evil....

I mean market cap are different and the impact can also be mighty elsewhere and EVEN MORE! 

I believe GME to 500$ was already a huge statement!

I don't know about you, but I'm tired of being the one who pays the price for their bullshit. When the dust has settled, and all is said and done, I don't want to work with a brokerage that actively chose to fuck over their client base. 

So, let's get a list going...

Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, National Class Action Law Firm, Announces  Class Action Investigation Against Robinhood and Other Brokers on  Behalf of Investors of AMC and Other Stocks Who Were Prevented from  Trading

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - January 28, 2021) -  Levi &  Korsinsky, LLP, a national securities law firm that has recovered  hundreds of millions of dollars for investors, announces that it has  commenced an investigation of Robinhood and other popular retail trading  platforms on behalf of investors who invested or were prevented from  investing in AMC and other stocks pursuant to trading bans on these  stocks.

On January 28, 2021, customers of Robinhood and other  popular trading platforms claimed that they were being blocked from  purchasing shares of 

AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and other securities that are being heavily shorted by institutional investors.  

Recently,  retail investors have turned the tables on Wall Street by buying up  stocks heavily shorted by hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, causing  increased volatility and short-squeeze losses to these institutional  investors.  However, on January 28th, Robinhood announced  that retail investors could no longer purchase certain stocks and raised  margin requirements for certain securities.

The inability to  trade shares has sparked outrage across social media, as users took to  Twitter to vent their frustrations, stating:

""You can no longer buy GameStop stock on Robinhood. Ditto Nokia, AMC, and all the other stocks that had been shorted.""

Another said: ""The free market is only free until rich people lose money.""

In  response to these actions, Dave Portnoy, the founder of the sports and  pop culture blog Barstool Sports, released a series of tweets  questioning Robinhood's integrity and agenda. He called for retail  investors not to close their positions. 

On January 28, AMC was down 60% amid the Robinhood restrictions.

Offers free stock, and has expanded benefits right now because they are trying to attract customers. They're even offering to cover the transfer fees. They must really want that market share. It‚Äôs also centered around social features, so you can invest and make posts about your stocks, and there are comments. Go spread the retardation.

‚Ä¢ [ally](https://ally.com) | just a regular trading app. Not special, but it‚Äôs from the finance startup Ally. Works with existing banks, and actually adheres to ally‚Äôs principles of facilitating economic mobility and democratizing finance. A lot of purple and white themes in this app. No commissions, and fast transfers. The same app I use, been a member for 2 years, no complaints. Also, they have dark mode. WARNING: ally only allows limit orders for meme stocks. you can still buy though.

‚Ä¢ [WealthSimple](https://wealthsimple.com) | A simple, minimalistic app with both saving and trading products. Has very nice shading, and pastel orange and turquoise colors. Bold font, and a very user friendly app.

‚Ä¢ [WeBull](https://webull.com) | an app owned by Chinese Fumi Technology. I heard they unbanned the meme stocks, please tell me if I‚Äôm wrong. Hopefully I‚Äôm not.

‚Ä¢ [M1](https://www.m1finance.com/) | A Chicago-based trading app filled with cool (blue and green and shit) color palettes, and many charts and metrics to track your trading performance.

They have played every option they have, they have resorted to morally wrong and illegal tactics. They have sold our shares without our permission. They are manipulating the market to save a corporation at the expense of millions of real humans. They have no problem crushing you and your future if it means another fucking dollar in their pocket. For too long, they have profited and gambled with our economy. In 2008 they threw millions into poverty, and in 2020 they lined their pockets while people were evicted from their homes. There is a reason why we fight. The invisible hand WILL NOT control us. This is the biggest financial event since 2008. All we have to do to beat them is hold our shares. They working class will seize control. We are on the verge of changing the fucking world.

Trading is being reopened for many brokers today. While it appears it is because of public backlash it‚Äôs actually because the big money has already accomplished their goal. 

It‚Äôs alleged that Apex was what was preventing the buying of certain securities. Namely meme stocks like GME and AMC. The purpose of this was to shake out retail and reduce volume. With the reduction of volume when this happened institutions performed a short ladder attack on very little volume. This is thus dropped the price like they wouldn‚Äôt be able to with normal trading volume.

After the price collapsed triggering stop losses from inexperienced investors. Institutions bought up all the shares being sold to close out there most toxic shorts and to reduce risk as much as possible in their portfolios. Since everyone was unable to buy except institutions they slowly covered their asses throughout the rest of the day. 

So now when this pops off institutions will now be bag holding as hard as they would have been. In addition to the fact they probably restructured their positions to make some gains on the way back up, to reduce their losses. They are still being fucked though, just a difference of a truck vs. a semi up the ass 

TLDR: blocking stock buying was an attack to save institutions asses, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if we can buy now that they have done what they needed too.

Tomorrow we will see shit come out of the woodwork that hasn't ever been witnessed in finance. I guarantee that all the Wall St CEOs know eachother well and they will start doing crazy shit tonight and during market tomorrow.

To have any chance at this WE MUST HOLD AND BUY. If you want to contribute to the fight then go on and get some more stock, options won't save us because we are not in possession of the shares, the suits could use that to trade them between themselves and negotiate new longer short contracts (so they can try to outlast us). Margin, as we have seen, will be terminated and given back to to the market.

Switch to a good brokerage (TD has worked for me) if you want to buy more, but I beg you don't close positions on the old one if you do.

WE LIKE THE STOCK üôåüíé üöÄüöÄüöÄ

1/29/21 16:06,"TRIPLE KILL: Citadel was cognizant of the entire ordeal and big ego lent to the demise of MC and further loss of reputation to RH. Citadel owns Robinhood and Melvin Capital.  Ken Griffin, now 28th richest in the world owns Citadel. 

Citadel has an incentive to keep it's subsidiaries alive. No shit.  A loss from MC affects Citadels bottom line.

More than half of us use RH and as we all know RH sells all that data primarily to Citadel.  Thus, Citadel had more than ample data (of all the massive option positions being bought and sold on GME, as well as Melvin Capital's risky and overlevered short position, ect)

If anything Citadel was in a better position than any other single hedge fund or institutional investor in the market to know exactly what the f*** was going to happen to GameStop, especially given that Citadel is basically the PLTR of retail trades. 

Why wouldn't Citadel warn Melvin Capital to close their position when gamestop gapped up $30 last week to 50 or $60 a share and when hundreds of thousands of contracts were bought that very day??   (Too many options being bought in a hard to borrow stock creates a great likelihood of a huge squeeze when sellers of options need to buy the underlying shares to stay delta neutral).  At a minimum why not at $120 the next day when the price doubled and more?  Why wait to $500? It's like what the fuck did you think was going to happen -- did you think we'd close at $100 simultaneously and all take our profits so you could further short 200% of the float? 

This is all one man's ego and it started from the top and worked its way down.  Now Citadels fucked MC and RHs suffered a huge loss to reputation.

The mere fact that brokers like ibkr and clearing houses or whatever eventually said no to buying GME and AMC bc they didn't want to put up with the risk of having to cover mass delinquencies, which could cause them to go under, is merely incidental to and neither the actual nor proximate cause of all of this bullshit.  

Tldr; Citadel had more resources, data, and knowledge of the surrounding GME ecosystem at the time than anyone else and could have warned MC about the impending GME üöÄ.   
If the market is the Matrix, then the architect is risk management.   Ken Griffin had all the resources at his disposal (he thought) to play architect and ultimately still failed hard, UNLESS he knew all along his back up plan came with a kill switch.
Anything else that CNBC tells you about stupid over 100% short float laws and clearing houses wanting to refrain is just incidental.

I'm really excited to see us destroy some of the scummiest hedge funds out there. I'm talking about the ones who short for the sake of shorting, and forbid us from earning our well deserved tendies.

That said, I do have questions regarding the potential of runaway inflation. If all of us somehow took GME, AMC etc to the moon and earned an instant 300k+, where would we spend that money?

Personally, I would pay off my 30k+ student loan, and buy a house... 

But so would all of you retards (or so I assume).

So my next question: if all us retards begin to splurge our tendies on items like TV's, phones, food, cars etc... would we be transitioning the hyper-inflation from the stock market into the commercial markets?

And if so, what would the risks be for those who were not already invested? Will they suffer from runaway inflation?

I see this misconception alot amongst my friends, coworkers, and for the new autists that recently joined WSB due to the recent series of events. Most of the older experienced traders and earlier WSB lurkers know this so I hope to give a little bit better clarity for people in on the ‚ÄúSqueeze‚Äù craze trying to maximize their profits. 

1. If you have $1000 in capital and you purchase 1 share of Company A for the entire $1000, Company A then goes up 20% today, your end of day value for that share is $1200 and you profit $200. 

2. If you have $1000 and you spent all of it on 100 shares of Company B at $10 per share, Company B end of day is up 20%, the end value of your shares is $10per share x1.2= $12 per share. $12/share x 100 shares = $1200 net profit is again $200.

Your gain is the SAME even if you had more shares in company B if your capital spent is the same amount and both companies go up proportionally the same. 

I see many posts saying ‚ÄúAMC is good if you cant afford GME‚Äù, ‚Äú Im too poor for GME, ill go AMC‚Äù, yes technically true if you dont have enough capital for even 1 share of GME then AMC is a good choice. 

For example as of right now during the writing of this, Premarket GME has gained 100% while AMC is up 55%. Im sure you guys can see whats going on here right? 

Due to GME‚Äôs SI and gamma squeezes, % jumps are going to be much larger üöÄüöÄ if youre looking to maximize gains. Obviously this will spill over to the others but GME is a special class on its own here.

Also AMC has been very forward about continuing to dilute shares to pay off their debt and taking advantage of the crazy price run up. They diluted twice this month already so your potential squeezes might not materialize. Please feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, ill try to edit to the best I can, Im not a math genius honestly and quite retarded.

1/29/21 20:29,"THE BIGGEST SECURITIES FRAUD IN OUR HISTORY **Disclaimer**: This is NOT my DD. This was posted by /u/thecoziestboy on the 'Daily Discussion' chat. He could not post this on his own because of karma/account age restrictions. All credit goes to him, I'm just the smooth-brained voice-box. Mods lemme know if this is against the rules, and I'll delete it. Anyway, here's what he shared:

**TL;DR**: Hedge funds *most probably* gamed stock prices for other trending tickers in order to use profits from expiring OTM calls to offset losses on $GME


I‚Äôm starting to connect the dots between OTM Call contracts, Thursday‚Äôs RH Shenanigans, and GME. In this post I‚Äôm going to explain how I believe they are all interconnected, and how RH and Citadel have committed Securities Fraud that will once again force average Americans to foot the bill of Wall Street‚Äôs bad bets. But only if they get away with it. 


For starters, we need to go back to Monday, Jan 25th. 


Robinhood ‚Äúsells‚Äù us these deep OTM options at the start of the week. We buy them up like crazy in stocks like NOK, BB, AMC, etc. All trends until Wednesday indicate that many of these once deep OTM calls will be ITM come Friday, which would result in catastrophic losses for the MM.


Who is RH‚Äôs MM and very likely the main issuer of all of these call options? Citadel LLC. 


Now what would Citadel have to gain from issuing such an insane volume of Call options? Let‚Äôs find out. 


We have seen attempt after attempt after attempt for Citadel or Melvin Capital Management to manipulate GME and other stocks over the last few days in AH trading, and during the ladder selling to decrease the price of GME while many retail investors were locked out of buying more stock and attempted triggering of limit sell orders utilizing RH data. 


What we saw Thursday was their nuclear option, last case scenario, ‚Äúoh fuck‚Äù moment. 


When it was apparent that their cheaper attempts to manipulate the market was not working, what did they do? Publicly and openly restrict the buying (but not selling) of WSB stocks... and it‚Äôs worse than everybody thinks, and I‚Äôll get to that in a minute. 


By restricting buying, but allowing selling,  RH and Capital were able to reduce demand in the market an astounding amount, causing stock prices in all of these WSB stocks to fall, this then caused a domino effect as paper hands folded their hands and caused a domino effect on all of our WSB stocks. 


What‚Äôs the net impact of this?


While GME hands were able to hold, (which is amazing but we will need to circle back to) They dropped the stocks to critical levels in BB, NOK, AMC that will earn Citadel **billions** as INSANE VOLUMES OF Call contracts expire OTM Friday 1/29. They will then turn around and use these billions to close out their position in GME. To show how much the MMs stand to gain here, I have linked the attached image to show the ridiculous amount of money that they will gain if their plan goes through [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/fw46dcR)


They manipulated us into taking a bet that they had already planned to fix. They knew if these bets miss we are left with nothing and they gain all the upside. They have committed countless acts of securities fraud through the past week that ultimately have robbed retail investors, forcing them to pay the bill for Short-Sellers‚Äô catastrophic bets.


In essence, our only hope at forcing a GME squeeze actually goes against what we have been thinking this entire time. Before, it meant on this subreddit was that we need to focus entirely on GME. I fear now RH and Citadel have forced us into a position where our only way to ensure a GME squeeze is to ensure that they are unable to profit off these Call contracts in the other stocks that so many of us are exposed to. 


We have created a war, and I feel the only way we can 'win' handily is if they don't profit off of the other tickers. HAVING SAID THAT, GME is our absolute priority, and needs to be absolutely HAMMERED today. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS BOYS. This is the only way.

1/29/21 19:20,"REAL DIRECT Link between Robinhood and atleast one hedge fund that lost money short selling So Bloomberg reports D1 Capital Partners has lost 20% of its 20 billion dollar portfolio. That's 4 billion dollars you guys congratulations! Link to this:[https://buzzwind.com/en/d1-capital-stung-by-amc-short-bet-undone-by-reddit-traders/](https://buzzwind.com/en/d1-capital-stung-by-amc-short-bet-undone-by-reddit-traders/). Now they lost their money because they were shorting AMC. While Robinhood banned buying of GME yesterday and we all lost our minds it also banned the buying of AMC, allowing this hedge fund to exit it's short positions without enough trouble.   


If you read the holdings page for D1 capital it says that these firms are not required to disclose their short positions in their 13F. THIS IS MASSIVE! The hedge funds collude on what positions to short as they tend to short similar stocks.  [https://fintel.io/i13f/d1-capital-partners/2020-09-30-0?source=content\_type%3Areact%7Cfirst\_level\_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain\_content%7Cbutton%3Abody\_link](https://fintel.io/i13f/d1-capital-partners/2020-09-30-0?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)  


Another interesting 13F is from Woodline partners which was founded by Citadel Alum: [https://fintel.io/i/woodline-partners-lp](https://fintel.io/i/woodline-partners-lp). Look how it says -100% for AMC and NOK, suggesting to me that they might have started shorting these companies.  


Anyway howw does this all relate to Robinhood and its investors?? So it turns out 1/3rd of the money owned by D1 capital is invested in Private companies. It bought shares in robinhood in leading its series G for atleast 200 million dollars: [https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-funding-idUSKCN26E062](https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-funding-idUSKCN26E062)  


THIS IS IT! D1 Capital has stakes both in Robinhood and in atleast one short trade in AMC possibly more. They used their board position to force Robinhood's hand to shut down these shares to be bought so that their prices come crashing and D1 capital can exit its positions. Don't let this thread die. We need to upvote for visibility to SEC and Investigators.  


TL;DR D1 Capital has a board member in Robinhood and atleast a 200 million dollar stake. D1 Capital was shorting AMC and losing 4 billion dollars in such trade. D1 Capital is CROOKED AF this is insane and so blatant but i guess for 4 billion dollars u gotta risk it all

While this was happening in my home, I saw hedge funders literally drinking champagne as they looked down on the Occupy Wall Street protestors. I will never forget that.

My Father never recovered from that blow. He fell deeper and deeper into alcoholism and exists now as a shell of his former self, waiting for death.

**1) 5G. 5G. 5G. 5G. NOK is a leader in the 5G technology space and there are plenty of reasons why 5G will create additional upside in the stock.**

* 5G paves the way for autonomous vehicles
* NOK was Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project

**2) This is a technology company (think TSLA, AAPL, AMZN) and not an old phone company.** 

* NOK is a major contender in the cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicles space. The company has partnerships with other large companies in both the United States and  Europe. This means GROWTH GROWTH & GROWTH which is what investors care about. 

**3) Remember that Trump launched the Space Divison last year? How much money does the United States spend on defense every year? >> $750Bn**

* In 2020 NASA awarded Nokia (NOK) first mobile cellular network on the moon (no pun intended here). Stocks pertaining to the Space economy are a new emerging sector  right now. You're seeing all these Space ETFS coming into the market.  This new emerging space economy is worth around $2 trillion.

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

We should show some love to $SCHW by the best way possible - buying the fuck out of the stock and transferring over your investments/holdings. I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

We need to send **RobinHood, ETrade** and **Webull** a message by leaving their brokerages in the masses. **We will not tolerate Market Manipulation.** This will be the fastest way to say FUCK YOU to each platform. The upcoming class action lawsuites will decide their fate later.

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Even my girlfriend's boyfriend signed up and asked me for investing advice.

Combine that with all the upset Robinhood, E Trade, WeBull users that will be transferring their investments/holdings to Fidelity/Ameritrade/Schwab next week.

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 16% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week.

Schwab and TD Ameritrade were so overloaded that it was experiencing a slow down over the past few days due to the insane amount of new retail investors and increased usage.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 5.8 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to absolutely destroy upcoming earnings. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Everyone seems to be investing with their tendy money. Just look at last years growth in new accounts. Current Q1 2021 numbers will blow away these registrations to the point that the servers were overloaded the past week with so many registrations. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transfers their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuites as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuites against it and possible liquidity issues?

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** Transfer your money/holdings from your scumbag brokerages into TD Ameritrade/Schwab since it was one of the only brokerages who didn't lock out its users. Combine that with expected next earnings beat thanks to growth in retail users + account transfers. Load up in calls in the process and get rich as we send it to the moon. Fuck RH, WeBull, ETrade.

1/29/21 23:58,"AMC STRONG BUY W/ ZACKS RESEARCH $21 PT. Friends and fellow tards,

The shiny sky circle has landed upon us for another day. The gods and lord musk have boosted the computer Penny back to strong levels. GME and AMC are having strong pre-markets. AMC has had volume that is baffling, and today on top of being less restricted it has obtained a price target of $21 dollars. 

I think this is substantial because alot of investors and firms are being steered away from these shares we are battling over. If more analysts and firms stop the restrictions we could really do what we set out to do and we can attempt to follow a similar trend to our video game brethren.. after all movies and video games are so nice for our smooth brains. 

I expect some of our less successful, more analytically inclined friends to start to back our rally and yes, even those fucking silver haired boomer fucks may join in with AMC because they even partook in such fuckery as middle aged autists.. hell even some of our older WSB fuckers may have been conceived during movie panky. 

Retards, fundamentalists, boomers and anything that identifies as something that can breathe.. buy and hold AMC to the moon. 

TLDR - will more people back AMC now? Not just our movement?

1/29/21 23:37,"You guys are winning this game! Keep it up! In the current state of the world, information is abundant. The age of the internet and computers has thrust humans into an indigestible world of data points that has invaded our consciousness. This trend is even more true in the world of the stock market where investors scramble for any information that could give them an edge over their peers. Financial and economic reports and data are countless, these being the things this website hopes to surface and make available to all.

The growth of information has not levelled the playing field. In many ways, the stock market is still ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù with the hedge funds raising the ante every day as they advance their edges against each other and the retail investor. The peek behind the curtain that Michael Lewis‚Äô Flash Boys paints the picture well, hedge funds can have their way with the stock market. Of course, regulators like the SEC and FINRA have ‚Äúdone their part‚Äù in protecting the small traders by forcing some sort of transparency. We can after all see selected data on short interest and other long positions. And CNBC is there to keep that information circulating in front of you.

But up until August 2020, Robinhood shared what stocks its investors were holding. That data was available publicly through a portal, and not even slightly as revealing as what it sells to its customers. The platform that first introduced no commission trading, freeing the little guy from the chains of $5-$10 commissions, sells its order data to hedge funds. This means that hedge funds, the same ones that are massively short stocks like GME and AMC, can see what these retail traders on Robinhood are doing. A little like how Google can see your every search and prescribe ads for you before you realize you wanted something. With this data, massive financial firms set up algorithms to beat them before they‚Äôve even started playing.

This game has never been one of symmetric information. Never. Hedge funds and big banks and other financial institutions ‚Äúwinning‚Äù this game have known everything that the ordinary person has and then some. Even the Reddit community beating them at their own game, WallStreetBets, is entirely public (for the most part) and has been allegedly spammed by bots from the hedge funds. To say that this community has done anything more than work together to punish the big traders for walking a tightrope on leveraged trades and insane shorting positions is ludicrous. And for Wall Street to think that they could avoid taking the loss by doubling down on their shorts is equally ludicrous.
 
The stock market should be a free market. There should be no distortions created by brokerages restricting anyone‚Äôs trading privileges, and the regulators should seek to condemn those who did the restricting. Guess what. Wall Street lost this one. Just like LTCM lost in 1998 after a Russia financial crisis. Just like Lehman Brothers and many other companies lost in 2008 in their dark pools of mortgage-backed securities and derivatives. But this time the little guys didn‚Äôt get dragged down with them, and they have the audacity to have disdain for that. $70 billion in losses is not enough of a lesson for them.

But they didn‚Äôt lose because the retail trader knew something they didn‚Äôt know. The game of asymmetric information continues even in a world flooded with data. Imagine playing chess without knowing where the opponent‚Äôs pieces are while he or she knows the positions of yours. MTS Insights will continue to contribute to transparency in the stock market and the economy. We support the pursuit of a level playing field for the retail investor in finance no matter how impossible it may seem to achieve.

1/30/21 18:54,"Update on AMC/GME Short Interest from an HF Analyst (DD, will update with more info tomorrow) One of my good friends is an analyst at one of the bigger financial firms and during market hours yesterday, he pulled up the updated short interest on AMC. Here is the data: https://imgur.com/a/VRS7vLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, as of market close on Thursday, shorts on AMC have doubled down on their positions. Almost no shorts exited their positions during the criminal and illegal period where brokerages halted AMC/GME buying. This looks good for us, because a short squeeze has yet to happen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As seen on the short shares data, around 165 million of AMC shares are being sold short. To calculate short interest, we mainly want to look at 2 things: shares outstanding and market float. For all you autists out there, the difference between these 2 numbers is that market float is the total number of publicly available shares in the market. ON THE OTHER HAND, shares outstanding includes restricted shares (like executive stock options) that cannot be exercised without special permission from the SEC.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's important to look at here is the market float, because that is what we are competing against the hedge funds with. The current market float of AMC is around 100 million shares. With some quick monkey math, we see that the short interest with respect to the market float is 165%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What does this mean for AMC? The squeeze has yet to happen. Buy shares and hold baby. Hedge Funds playing the short side will have nasty tactics up their sleeve, but they played their biggest trick on Thursday by restricting clearing firms and brokers. If we hold and buy shares, they are FUCKED.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW, ONTO GAMESTOP: Based on the data from my friend, the news is not as great for GME as it is for AMC, but it is still VERY good. Here is the short interest data for GME: https://imgur.com/a/N77KcfS. As we can see, those criminal hedge fund bastards closed a fuck ton of their short positions when the brokers restricted GME buying. As of now, the shorted GME shares is hovering around 60 million shares.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's do some more quick monkey math: Based on Yahoo finance, the market float of GME is around 47 million shares. This means the short interest with respect to market float is around 127% for GME. Although it is not as high as it used to be, the squeeze has yet to be squoze.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what do we do with GME? The same as AMC. We buy and hold and buy and hold until the criminal bastards at the hedge funds are forced to close their positions. I asked my friend for the short data on our other beloved stocks, and I will say that AMC has the highest short interest currently with respect to market float. However, if we buy and hold everything, the price will eventually squeeze. I know that RH is being retarded right now, but do everything you can to purchase these shares if we want to squeeze AMC/GME. Open Webull, Fidelity, etc. Personally, I hopped over to Cashapp to buy a fuck ton of AMC shares on the dip. Anything works. It's us against them.

If this get's enough attention/if all of you guys are interested, I will ask my friend to pull up the updated short data over the weekend to update you guys on Friday's (yesterday) price action.

I'm hugely skeptical of all the information being put out. Shitron ""will no longer publish ‚Äúshort reports‚Äù"". Doesn't mean they won't stop shorting, just like every other Wall Street guy. Cramer saying sell. **IT'S ALL BULLSHIT**

Now onto Short Interests.
Hold your GME shares, it'll hurt all the way up for these fucks. Why you say? 

Based on supposed data from S3 (I will continue to refer to everything as supposed, because it's getting insane to discern credible news anymore).


Link: [(Cool pictures on twitter)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

short interest is $11.20B; 57.83M shares shorted; 113.31% of Float; 53.12% S3 SI% Flt; 29% fee & easing. Shares shorted down -5.08M shares, worth $983 million, -8.07%, last week. Shorts down -$19.75B in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$7.83B on today's +70% move.


**That's almost $8 Billion dollars boys and girls. If that continues, and shorts stay in (this is also approximate math), that means at $1k per GME it'll be at least $32B more compounded onto their loss porn.** (BETTER FUCKING SHOW THAT SHIT, I GET OFF TO IT)



Now onto AMC (same data sources)

[(Cool pictures on twitter)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194013461204994?s=20)

short interest is $384M; 44.47M shares shorted; 15.75% of Float; 13.61% S3 SI% Flt; 11.32% fee. Shares shorted down -906K shares, worth $8 million, -2.00%, last week. Shorts down -$523M in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$211M on today's +55% move.


Only $211M on a 55% move... That means to reach gamestop levels of loss porn, the stock would have to practically need to hit 2000% gains at the moment (math here: $8b losses on gme divided by $211M losses on amc, multiply all this by 55% and you get 2000%, math is probably wrong but I'm autistic.)


That's why I see üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ for GME. Continue holding AMC, but I'm on the DFV train. I SELL WHEN HE SELLS.

**EXTREME TL:DR:** You don't have to do anything but hold.


**TL:DR:** I see GME as a bigger adventure (and war). Hold till hedge funds have to declare bankruptcy. All this current news is fluff to convince you to sell your tendies and make them money. They're still shorting because they think we're üßªüßªüßªüôåüôåüôå bitches. BUT we're üíéüíéüíéüôåüôåüôå.

Trading was always considered something you'd do in secret. You like a stock, you buy it and pray that it goes up so you make a profit.

1/30/21 07:09,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 29, 2021 after market close) * After a hiatus due to GME craze, reeeeecaps are back for a limited time. The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET.

This is getting ridiculous. You all are posting or trying to rush to the next company to try to get in cheap because you believed you missed out on the GME short squeeze, WHEN THE GME SQUEEZE HASN'T EVEN OCCURRED YET. All your posts about AMC and NOK are lazy and the only theory you have as to why the price for these companies are going up is because you can squeeze the shorts on these companies and beat the hedge funds. Lots of people have already lost money on these stocks on Thursday.

FLASHBACK to several months before GME exploded and this sub gained millions of new followers, there was a fundamental bull thesis for GME as a company and their future prospects. That's why many of us, including myself, got in early when the price was between $10-$20. GME was not going bankrupt despite the narrative behind it. They had cash on hand to pay down debt. They are going to crush their Q4 earnings because of console sales and historically have done very well during game console releases. They have revenue sharing agreements with Microsoft. They are opening gaming centers. Their 1000+ retail locations can be transformed to distribution centers. Their ecommerce is rapidly growing every year. Ryan Cohen and the new board members are yelling at the boomers running GME and telling them what they need to do in this new era of gaming and digital.

The short interest + squeeze on GME is CHERRY ON TOP. And the timing of catalysts because of console release, Q4 earnings, and digital sales because of the pandemic puts GME owners in a unique spot to capitalize on the shitty positions shorters find themselves now to be squeezed.

TLDR: Before you blindly throw your money at AMC and NOK because of ""short squeeze"" think about whether or not there are going to be any catalysts and bull cases as to why the stock price should be going up to potentially trigger a squeeze or else you'll be left holding major bags.

I am not a financial advisor. This is a DD (Due Diligence) post in regard to the upcoming squeeze aimed at AMC. The information is a collection of research from credible sources with some of my personal thoughts on the topic.

NOTE: ANYONE WHO IS INFORMED ON THE MARKET AND HOW IT WORKS, SKIP TO PART 2.

This DD will cover more than average DD's since WSB has gained a large following of new traders who can benefit from a full description.

Part 1: $AMC, what is it? üéûÔ∏èüéüÔ∏è

---[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres)---
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. is an American movie theater chain headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market ahead of Regal and Cinemark Theatres.

Part 1.2: What is a squeeze?ü§èüèº

A squeeze in the market ($GME, $AMC) is a phenomenon that occurs when shorts have to be covered, especially by high class traders (hedge fund managers). 

Part 1.3:What are shorts, why are they popular with the top 1%?

In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date (the expiration date of the short). The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting on the prices decline and then can purchase them at a lower cost. This stategy is HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD.

Part 1.4 (final intro peice): Why do squeezes cause losses up top?

Simple. In the case of $GME the hedge funds bet that $GME would fall. Logically, they should have been right. But as I'm sure everyone knows, WSB and working class investors from all over the world flipped the trend on its head. So, since the hedge funds bet on a fall they had to cover the losses caused by their BORROWED positions becoming absolutely useless (nice). 

Part 2: The stats on $AMC. üìàüß†

---Paraphrased from ""Yahoo Finance"", Some IMO.---

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 101.95 million shares. Now what everyone is waiting for it when shorted shares become useless and the hedge funds have to cover what they bet and lost on. Today's target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 and we closed at $13.29! This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Feb 1/21) So Monday when they're forced to cover the $8.63 they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher from said stimulus. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a strong squeeze. $AMC is standing where $GME did a week ago. Hold your ground. Gains coming in hot next week. 

Part 3: What are our targets for buying and selling?üíµüìàüíµ

THIS REQUIRES DIAMOND HANDS üíéüëê

From what I have read, buying into $AMC at $17 or below is a safe bet. My exit plan is to secure some profit next week as the squeeze reaches it's height, and reinvest (into $AMC)  a comfortable amount based on collected gain. I plan to keep shares for up to 12-18 months so long as $AMC keeps on the track we can see now.
AGAIN, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. MY WORD IS NOT LAW.

Part 4: Beware The Big Man (Reason for Holding)üè¶üö´

Big money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare us investors out of buying and holding with the intent of executing their shorts as planned or to cushion the blow from failed investment. Again, üëêüíé.

Part 5: The Conclusion on $AMC in short (wording wise) üöÄüöÄ

‚Ä¢The statistics on this stock are legit. 

‚Ä¢The company is longstanding (70+ years)

‚Ä¢The company is legit

‚Ä¢A squeeze is seemingly inevitable

‚Ä¢Being the largest theatre company, post COVID gains are likely as cinemas will re-open.

‚Ä¢The hedge funds are in a position to be bent over again via their shorts in $AMC.

‚Ä¢Last but not least, I know alot of you autists lost alot of money gambling during highs on $KTOV, $XSPA, $GNUS, and many others... So why not get some tendies for once.

1/30/21 15:06,"Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds. As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

>It‚Äôs been a wild ride for the nation‚Äôs largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

1/30/21 13:40,"The big scandal: Some explanations & why trading got halted. Citadel & Point72 bailed out Melvin Capital which was the GME short selling bagholder, but it does not end here.

There are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.

So first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.

They hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.

Melvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.

Trust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.

Second, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.

It's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.

And I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.

It gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .

Interactive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept ""going and going"", so regulators & brokers agreed to stop it all to ""stop the losses"".

Robinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like ""oh didn't notice anything special was going on"" ü§°.

Webull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.

Not sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.

&#x200B;

My 2 cents:

Short sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.

Brokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.

My personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).

Maybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.

The counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.

I think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.

Lehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.

And sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.

So buy. Robinhood tried to scare me. But I switched to schwab and I bought even more, in fact I transferred more money in and bought the dip. Though, This isn‚Äôt about the money anymore. It‚Äôs about the revolution. It‚Äôs about showing the funds who‚Äôs boss. That they can‚Äôt manipulate us into paperhand selling. We will not be manipulated anymore. Retail together can easily destroy funds. Remember this heading into Monday and we will all see unlimited tendies next week. It‚Äôs about free markets we want to make it clear to the funds and big boy media groups that they can‚Äôt just manipulate the market and strike fear into the market with media advertisements to make us sell. They should know once we have decided it‚Äôs going up and that we like the stock, it‚Äôs going to moon.

1/30/21 12:40,"AMC - What is happening & future? Let‚Äôs break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when it‚Äôs time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

1/30/21 12:21,"Is GME a zombie squeeze? Everybody is optimistic about GME and I am and have been since I got in at $15. I got out at $60 but my risk tolerance isn‚Äôt super high so I‚Äôm fine with it and enjoying watching all of the gains from the sidelines.

I‚Äôm not trying to rain on the parade but I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about VW, AMC, and GME and their short squeezes. Until this week, and specifically today, I‚Äôve basically been of the mind set that GME is a real squeeze and the others (AMC, etc.) are not. But today I‚Äôve changed my opinion. Please hear me out because I think there is a lot of logic to this.

THE SQUEEZE SQUOZE, NOW IT‚ÄôS SIMPLE SUPPLY DEMAND
Ryan Cohen and GME ruling out bankruptcy are what caused the squeeze. Plain and simple. They created a better outlook and higher genuine value for the company. This gave us a little squeeze forcing shorts to move from their ~140% to ~120% short interest today.

Now that that squeeze occurred and they had to deal with raised price targets, we are simply dealing with very low supply. Shorters are not buying to cover really and lots of retards are buying creating upward movement a momentum. Not much supply. So right now there is no squeeze going on and we are all very dependent on stock lenders margin calling the shorts.


THIS ISN‚ÄôT VW
Just wanted to add a short section here since this event does seem to be the inspiration we all draw from. In this case the shorts did get fucked and got margin called. The lenders did this because there was genuine concern that they would not get there stock back since there is 13x more shorted than there was available. If you buy that 1% and give it back to a lender you have 12% more to go, then you have to buy that 1% from that lender you just got it from, but what if they won‚Äôt sell? There was genuine concern from lenders they would never get their shares back. Total loss.


THESE SHORTS WONT BE MARGIN CALLED ANY TIME SOON
As it currently stands the shorts are paying 30% APR on tens of billions of dollars to the lenders with VERY LITTLE risk in the long term that they will not be able to get the shares back as EVERYBODY (even is, mind you) expects the shares to go back down a lot after this is said and done.

So from a lender‚Äôs perspective, would you rather call your shares back and end the party with huge yearly returns? Or would you rather drag this on for as long as possible and collect fees from shorts? The shorts will happily do it because they don‚Äôt want to lose their shirt, they would rather pay the premium. And even if they did call their shares back, the market would explode and crash before they even had them settled.

Really in the end, we are giving Melvin and the other shorts more time to adjust their position to a more favorable one before it comes back down. So in the end, unlike your believe that bears are fuk, it is retail investors that may be fuk.


CAN GME SQUEEZE HARDER?
I would say probably not soon. It could go higher if people keep buying and holding, but again, in the end retail might end up paying.

The one opportunity I do see would be a share vote or something else that could cause shares to be recalled. But that is unlikely and might not even happen at the yearly investor meeting.


HOW TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS
Honestly without lucky timing retail investors may be fucked here. Premiums on puts make it practically impossible to profit.

WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SQUEEZES?
Similarly to the current state of GME, we are driving price up and giving shorts better entry and lenders fat APR.

TL;DR: this may be the best trick Wall-street ever played on us. Play acting that they are losing money and Robinhood is their martyr.

Edit: Thanks for commenting everybody. After this interaction I think the squeeze could work out, but it would take insane diamond hands and/or some strong buy pressure. Time and high borrow rates need to ware them down to be sure that this squeeze happens.",18113,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.996617615,True

How Clearing Demands Helped Ground the WallStreetBets Stocks

Telis Demos

‚Ä¢

&#x200B;

Last Updated January 29, 2021, 6:33 PM

When some online brokers including Robinhood Markets Inc. and Webull Financial LLC moved this week to restrict trading in GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other stocks, fueled by Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, they did so in part because of obligations with clearinghouses that help ensure trading across the market isn't disrupted by defaults. Here's how it works.

&#x200B;

What is a clearinghouse?

&#x200B;

Consider the basics of trading: Buyers and sellers must agree on a price. The buyer then must pay the seller, and ownership must be formally transferred.

&#x200B;

Enter clearinghouses. The clearinghouse collects and distributes payments and transfers ownership. So traders are free to focus just on price, and to take the best price in the market regardless of who is offering it. Neither side has to worry about the other's ability to pay.

&#x200B;

For stocks in the U.S., the main clearinghouse is National Securities Clearing Corp., which is part of a larger clearing organization that operates in other markets, called Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.

&#x200B;

How do they work?

&#x200B;

Clearinghouses serve to mutualize risk. Members keep cash or collateral such as Treasury securities at the clearinghouse to cover their own activities and the obligations of other members should they fail. The clearinghouse might ask the members to post more of this money, often known as margin, if they are making riskier trades. The aim is to ensure that no individual member's failure causes the whole system to collapse.

&#x200B;

How does the financial crisis figure in this?

&#x200B;

In response to the 2008 collapse of broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., lawmakers writing the Dodd-Frank Act sought to beef up supervision of clearinghouses and to push more trading into clearinghouses. The focus was primarily on so-called over-the-counter derivatives, like credit-default swaps, that didn't have a central marketplace. The reforms also affected some longstanding clearinghouses, including National Securities Clearing Corp., by designating them as systemically important financial market utilities, which subjected them to greater regulatory scrutiny.

&#x200B;

Why would a clearinghouse have to increase requirements?

&#x200B;

As noted earlier, margin requirements often rise with risk. A sharp rise in the price of any security raises the prospect that it will decline just as fast, potentially adding to the risk of those trading and holding as collateral these securities.

&#x200B;

A challenge in the stock market is that settlement is not instant. The system allows two days after the day a trade happens until the shares and money must change hands, known as ""T+2"" settlement. Over those two days, the risk that a party might be unable to complete a trade can, in rare circumstances, change dramatically based on market conditions.

&#x200B;

One such circumstance might be when the price of a security is extraordinarily volatile. In that case, the seller is exposed to increased risk that in the event of a failure of a buyer to pay up, the security they would be stuck still owning is worth dramatically less. The extraordinary volatility of a stock like GameStop would increase such a concern.

&#x200B;

Another is the risk that a party suddenly owes an outsize amount of cash. In a normal market, any clearing member likely has a mostly balanced book of buys and sells, meaning they are both paying and receiving cash. And often many of their own customers' trades cancel each other, meaning they have no net obligation to the clearinghouse. But when a firm has a huge imbalance of buy orders, its obligation to pay cash skyrockets. This may have been the case this week, when there was much demand for just one or two stocks.

&#x200B;

So who decides it's time to increase margin requirements?

&#x200B;

How a clearinghouse judges these risks, and therefore when it makes demands for more upfront funds, is typically formulaic. Margins can be based on equations such as value-at-risk. Exactly how the formula works, and who is responsible for losses in what order, are important elements. In the case of National Securities Clearing Corp., losses would be covered by the defaulting member's funds before the clearinghouse's own funds or other members' funds would be used.

&#x200B;

A broker like Robinhood would also have to make decisions about its own capital, and how much it was willing or able to tie up in settlement. A broker may face separate obligations for capital levels, like with the SEC. Other brokers also clear via another intermediary -- like Apex Clearing, through which WeBull clears -- that is a member. These intermediaries may have their own risk controls they apply to their clients.

I don‚Äôt typically do posts like this and so this is fucking new to me. Anyways, it seems like a shit ton of you are falling out of favor with NOK. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with you if you expected to gain a shit ton of money in a day, but what the fuck I have never seen such üßªü§≤üèª in my fucking life for the past two days. 

Are you guys really just going to stand there and let the enemy beat the fuck out of us. 

And of course some of you are going to mention the total float as if that fucking matters because the stock is still cheap as fuck (for now lol üöÄ) and because we managed to trade one fucking fifth of all the NOK stocks in circulation. They literally had to stop our asses from buying a couple of times. Just like you autistic retards I have lost thousands of dollars in this shit. My paychecks, birthday money, dividends, money from the sale of blue chips and Ark ETFs, etc.

So where‚Äôs the upside? Well let me fucking tell you where the upside is and when you can expect to pull off the biggest fucking heist alongside GME and AMC Wall Street will have ever seen. üî•üöÄüí∏

NOK is well known to be the bigger beast when it comes to the BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME). It has a fuck load of shares to go around and there‚Äôs a lot of paperhanded pussies out there, so I understand why it may be daunting to expect a Juggernaut like NOK to moon anytime soon. 

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. 

NOK releases its earnings on Thursday and its expected to blow the competition out of the fucking water. I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they‚Äôre developing. The üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª have had their big meaty claws ever since its ATH of $62 all those years ago. Do you really expect a change if you don‚Äôt fucking BUY and fucking HOLD. No, with a team of fucking retarded  superstars in this sub, NOK is prepping for a fierce comeback in the upcoming weeks. GME is top dog right now, but let‚Äôs be honest. GME hype can‚Äôt last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I‚Äôm on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100

What‚Äôs the plan, Stan?

The fucking plan is that you don‚Äôt buy market price. You look at the ask price and you fucking buy it. This is how we destroy walls. The $5 barrier battle today was hard fought and we fucking lost to the hedge funds. This next week is going to be fucking spectacular ü™ÑüöÄü§≤üèªüíé and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. 

You say NOK was a plan by the bots? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it‚Äôs pretty much identical. If NOK is a sham, then the idea of the BANG stocks is a sham. 

I know for a fucking fact you don‚Äôt believe that. I know that there‚Äôs dreamers in this sub. I dream just like you. I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.

If NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don‚Äôt give a fuck whether you‚Äôd want to see it or not, because honestly boys I‚Äôd eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. 

This year, BANG is for real.

So hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door. We‚Äôre pissed and we‚Äôre armed to the teeth.

EDIT: General cheese reporting. Post this shit everywhere. I dont give a fuck. I WILL be producing a flank strategy tomorrow. People have to know goddamn it. Monday/Tuesday will close at $7 just give it time

EDIT 2: some of you pussies are asking where you can buy NOK. The easiest way to buy it is with that fucking app all the whores on Tinder beg for food money on: Cashapp. There are literally no fucking limits and if you want an extra 2 fucking shares then use this shit when you sign the fuck up and get $10 extra buckaroos: BKXDNGQ. I also want to make it clear that everyone should share their cash apps so that we can get that $10 extra to put into NOK.

&gt;They could potentially to short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.



Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be &lt;$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

1/30/21 09:29,"PSA: Moving from Robinhood? Consider avoiding firms that use Apex Clearing Corp. Brokerages must use a custodian to clear all trades. Many brokerages use Apex Clearing Corp., which informed their clients this week that trades in GME and AMC (among others) would be restricted to closing-only. Brokerages that use Apex were forced to restrict their clients to closing-only, and had no voice in the matter. (Robinhood, TDAmeritrade, and Interactive Brokers do not use Apex Clearing and were dicks just because they're dicks).

&#x200B;

Firms that use Apex Clearing Corp., and therefore were forced to restrict the purchase of securities this week (and therefore may be forced to do so again in the future) include:

* WeBull
* SoFi
* Tasty Works
* Ally Invest
* M1 Finance
* Betterment
* Firstrade

&#x200B;

Some brokerages have their own clearing companies in-house, including Fidelity and ETrade. By the way, Robinhood makes all of its money by selling its order feed to Companies like Citadel (mainly Citadel). Fidelity is one of the  few brokerages out there which doesn't sell its orders to anyone, ever.

Tasty Works has worked well for me, but since they use Apex, they were forced to restrict the purchase of GME this week and I decided to move to a new brokerage. I created an account with both Fidelity and ETrade to give both of them a shot and this was my experience:

Fidelity:

 \- I filled out the application, but half way through the process I got a server timeout error (presumably because of lots of people doing the same thing as me). I tried again and it worked fine. I also had a question so I called their customer service number. I was on hold for about 3 minutes, then spoke with a real person who was nice and answered my question.

ETrade:

 \- I filled out an application, then got a screen saying that my account creation could not be completed until I called and spoke with a customer service representative. Ok. I called the number on the screen, and waited on hold for 43 minutes (at 8am). I called back later and waited on hold for about an hour and 15 minutes before giving up.

&#x200B;

Extra tidbit regarding Apex:

I tried to submit a Wiki entry for Apex Clearing Corp. last year, but was rejected 3 times because I couldn't provide any acceptable sources. Why couldn't I provide sources for the info? Because you won't find shit about them online which wikipedia considers to be a reliable source, other than on their own site (which was why I was trying to create the wiki page in the first place).",18285,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998641193,True

1/30/21 09:12,"AMC Short Squeeze Is Absolutely Possible to and Here is Why I'm not a financial advisor I have positions in AMC and this is not a financial advice.

I see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a ""scape-goat"" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.

There is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.

&#x200B;

# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

AMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.**

Yes it's still lower than GME's 200 something % but 116% is still very, VERY high.

If this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.

# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.

Just like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors.

Recently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.

Lastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts.

# 3. New Shorts are In The House

If you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel).

This means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course.

# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit

I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.

AMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more ""desirable"" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.

Because we LIKE these companies.

Because these companies have been beaten down during COVID or the current tech onslaught.

And...because they are not OVERVALUED.

Understand that as fast as you aquired this money, is as fast as it can disappear if you don't put some away. (hence the billionaires panicking).

*By slowing $BB I theorize they may have showed more of their cards than you think*.... *hear me out.*


***Theory:***  They run algos as a hedge ""group"" however many invested in and benefit from the trade data of retail (let's call them dipshits) 

Dipshits found an algo that has been printing free money for years, simple. Every play you see retail doing, wait until I hits certain metrics and short the fuck out of it to collect paychecks. 


Problem being: these moved faster than dipshits algo could ge recognize so it saw more sentiment and went for more shorts.

*and they don't have an off button*

So combine that with the bots spamming social media (that their algos monitor for plays) and dipshits were getting metrics readouts that said free money here. 

So they asked for $2.75 billion more to put on it. 

Dipshits iterally only have one play, to wait until a group gets excited and then short the stock for your money - ***and it's not fucking working*** so they stopped the game to try to turn it off (notice they still bought more short positions this week)

The $BB short position was only 7% shorts, so by their volatility definition it doesn't apply(so again why stop trade).... but it's now 9% shorted *after that news?!?*

#HOWEVER


At some point, as has happened to pretty much all short squeezes,


##Gamestop will offer shares to the shorts at some point. 


They already have a 100m dollar offer lined up, but they could easily offer more. Why would they do this? Because it would make them a fuck ton of money. 

At the end of the day, Gamestop is a business. They are in the midst of a huge transition, and the ability to clear debt and have more cash on hand during this time would be life changing money for this company. AMC did it this past week, it happened during the VW squeeze when
Porsche offered stock and made a fortune. Gamestop will likely do the same thing. They'd be absolutely stupid not too. 


What does this mean? Well, it means that your 69420 per share probably isn't going to happen, but I still expect a big ol squeeze is in the works. Just be prepared for this type of announcement, and when the dust settles let's make sure we continue to support the company.

1/31/21 00:23,"GME | Second Act | Margin Call Explained | AMC & Other High Short Interest Stocks To everyone that held, you‚Äôve leveled to diamond-hand generals. In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that‚Äôs why they took out new shorts on GME.

GME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack.

It shows that they‚Äôve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.

Next, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there‚Äôs not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \[1\]. Different rules for different players in this game!

But let‚Äôs move back to the whiteboard.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

Today, I‚Äôll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I‚Äôll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.

Note: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.

# Long/Short Strategy

In the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.

Ie buying Apple and shorting Gamestop.

This trade is profitable if Apple‚Äôs stock price rises and Gamestop‚Äôs (GME) share price decline.

However, let say the trade doesn‚Äôt go their way and Gamestop share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let‚Äôs say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.

When GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (> 50% of the float). This becomes what‚Äôs known as an arbitrage trade. I‚Äôll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It‚Äôs a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go someone's way.

# The High Short Interest Trade

Should Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.

I‚Äôll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.

Furthermore, I‚Äôll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy

In this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.

Going forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it‚Äôs hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn‚Äôt block us in this whiteboarding session.

Here is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \[2\]

1. Gamestop (GME)
2. AMC Networks (AMC)
3. Dillards (DDS)
4. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)
5. The Macerich Company (MAC)
6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)

I‚Äôll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \[3\]. Ortex data is shown in the imgur links. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.

As you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.

# Short Ladder Attack

A common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \[1\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren‚Äôt valuable when they are.

Usually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It‚Äôd be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.

That is why you‚Äôll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.

But you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.

# Short Squeeze Precedent

In the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.

Never trade more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. Diamond hands.

Listen you retards. I will explain the logic of why GME needs AMC and AMC needs GME.

GME feels like a late ship for many. GME is not attractive to many people out there at this levels, just the commited ones. AMC is the second most shorted stock here with big hedge funds on the other side. Chartwise, they moved the same.


For GME to rocket, it needs AMC hype. People will want to get in at 15$/share now that the company is not bankrupt anymore and feels like a realistic fair valued company which was kept to the ground with shorts.


GME needs to hold it's own a bit until AMC loads up on people. 

GME is WSB short squeeze.
AMC is the rest of dumb retail short squeeze.

They both need the fomo and hype of each other to pull this through.

AMC might have even more support if you think about Hollywood and stuff like that and that it might get boomers interested in saving their memories from AMC.


TLDR:.  AMC NEEDS GME, GME NEEDS AMC.

BB, NOK are not short squeezes . End of story


Edit: if AMC was a diversion, they would have not limited the share at 1 as well. They are both fucking the shorts now that's why they limited both of them.


Edit: DONT FUCKING PULL OUT OF GME FOR AMC, WE NEED TO GET AMC GOING TO GET GME GOING, THATS WHAT I SAY



AMC

44.3m shares shorted last time was disclosed.

101m float

37% tutes ownership

That leaves around 60m float on market

44 out of 60 is over 70% short.

Edit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.

Edit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.

Edit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.
Now here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.
Atleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this. You need this. We all need this.

Edit 5: now I'm hearing a lot about people talking about possibly missing the short squeeze if they transfer. In all honestly do you fucking care at this point? I don't. I'm all in and have literally put every dime I possiy could on GME I don't really give a shit about it. We are making these cunts bleed out. And if something at some point hits my sell limit I'll be happy, but if it doesn't I don't care because I KNOW THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING.",18542,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999161124,True

You don't want to mix high emotions and the stock market no matter what the circumstances are. The Wallstreetbet community which has now seen its membership grow exponentially is now filled with emotionally charged language, emojis and high morale as they draw first blood from the hedge funds. They are now rallying the entire world to ""fight their cause"" by jumping into the stock. Maniac investing, sky rocketing prices, emotions, FOMO, irrationality, bubble anyone?

Financial strains are appearing in the system. Robinhood drew down all their credit lines and raised 1 billion with existing investors. Although we didn't hear from Etrade, TD Ameritrade or Interactive Brokers, we expect them to face similar stress as evident by their share trading restriction. Back in 2015, the surprise announcement by Swiss National Bank to remove the 1.20 EURCHF peg caused massive volatility that led to the insolvency of fx brokers. Brokers are built to function with certain volatility assumptions and things are fine 99.999% of the time until a Black Swan shows up. Brokers are important clogs in the stock market mechanism and they cannot afford to fail in unison. Short brokerages appear to be a good trade here.

It may not stop with GME. GME is now $320, up  10x from the beginning of the year. Mob investors who missed the boat already have other targets in their crosshairs; AMC, Express, Bed Bath Beyond and Blackberry. This will further exacerbate the problem. 

Hedge funds, the villains of the industry have their fair share of failures in their storied past, but non as humiliating as this. Weak, vulnerable retail investors came to the realisation that, when well orchestrated in a community, they can take on these giants and beat them at their game. But hedge funds also serve an important role in price discovery and their sheer magnitude of their operation are a systemic risk to the markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a 3.6b bailout of LTCM in 1998 to prevent a wider collapse of the financial system.

‚Äã
I will return to that a bit later in this DD. Here's another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider $AMC at \~$13/share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time. ~~Bear~~ with me as I, too, am just a retard like some of the readers here.
‚Äã
Let's begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context:
‚Äã
* Market Cap (MC):  427.869 M
* Enterprise Value (EV): 11.349 B
‚Äã

When seeing that figure, you might wonder if you don't know shit, why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its Market Cap. A Company's EV is the total debt + market cap - cash on hand. As you may have heard in the recent news, nobody is having trouble getting access to cash. So then, why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes + aggregate value of the stonk. Well, my father used to say, the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it. If someone wanted to buy or takeover AMC, they need to pay around 11.349 B. In a few months, I anticipate that number to be so much higher.
‚Äã

The main reason I think $AMC dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk. That risk has been wholly eliminated, though I never saw it.
‚Äã

As we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least 18 Trillion in debt is negative yielding ([mostly bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/world-s-negative-yield-debt-pile-at-18-trillion-for-first-time)), we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like AMC to be have access to some of it. The rising stonk price even incentivized Silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them (silly bankers).
‚Äã

At the same time, the all-star CEO boomer Adam Aron himself grabbed an additional $304.8 M in cash through a direct listing initiated on Monday. I don't know why he couldn't wait until Wednesday to initiate because [it would've been over $1B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-stock-sale/amc-seizes-on-rally-to-sell-stock-but-misses-even-bigger-payday-idUSKBN29W2UP). I trust his judgement. Boomers are more experienced and have ~~steady~~ hands. At the same time, Aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as Apollo Global Management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on AMC.
‚Äã

The confluence of these factors (EV, Access to Liquidity, Stellar Executive Team) and the four I outline below, lead me to believe that even Stevie Wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least $30/share.  
‚Äã
‚Äã

**The undisputed market leader in theaters.**
‚Äã

* 1,0004 Theatres worldwide
   * Many auditoriums at AMC locations, often holding over more than one auditorium, seat over 400 people. 
      * They posted 5.47 million in revenues. Auditoriums were rarely at capacity.
   * 8,043 screens/auditoriums.
   * They will all be packed when opened back up.
      * Tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the re-opening of the movies. Keep this in mind. This is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points.
   * Margins are *ok* but especially good on the snacks. In the past, consumers have tended to say fuck AMC's margins and bring in their own goodies either because AMC's were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars. We expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people.  I recognize that this one is a reach, but it's my opinion not investment advice.
‚Äã

**The shifting sentiment from ""Netflix and Chill"" to in-person, shared and enjoyable experience.**
‚Äã

* I don't like people, but I miss them. Maybe you do too. In a mid-pandemic Gallup Poll, we all know how much those matter, [https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/). If I just put my finger in the air and give 35% of Netflix's market cap to AMC... you see where I'm going with this.
* I have seen others say this one as well, but I miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing, on the same screen, at the same time because we can share. 
* Netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come July, the boomer is coming with that heat. Everyone is anticipating trips to movies. I tried to make the popcorn. I used a half a stick of butter. It's not the same.
   * Running to 7-Eleven to get Slurpees and Raisinets while Netflix is buffering is super annoying. Last time, my 7-Eleven didn't even have Raisinets. \[Samuel L. Jackson voice\] ""Where's my mothafuckin Raisinets Jack?""
* As you think through this point, remember the last time you saw Samuel L. Jackson in the theaters. you weren't the only that was scared, so it was entertaining and not stressful.
* This point isn't totally out of my ass either. As streaming popularity has grown, so has AMC's  revenues, not including 2020. People watch more movies.
‚Äã

**Relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat.**   

Everyone here should check out a movie. They don't have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by Netflix or the sweeping device compatibility. You can stream from your laptop and connect to your.

* Studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for AMC to open back up. To me, that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship. I commend the studios for that and I think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly. Even Morningstar sees that and they usually don't see shit!
* The Netflix app is cool but we can all agree, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 80% of the content is ass. Movies are a crap shoot. Shows are a political statement. And there's not enough Chapelle.
   * What Chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry. While I am all for the new person on the block, I feel movies are very hard to make. Sometimes the Netflix ones suck hard. I don't recall too many times when I went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad. I've been disappointed, underwhelmed, but have never chucked my remote at the screen. I cannot say the same about Netflix. I have seen some terrible shit on Netflix, multiple times. I go there every day still because their app is so good, but Hollywood is still better at making films than Los Gatos or wherever the fuck. \*
* You can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now. I'm sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on Netflix.
   * I haven't done it yet, but I promise to do it for the first time tonight as I discovered the [On Demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/news-of-the-world-61825) product line in doing some research for this DD. I assure you that the products will be overpriced, and the digital experience will be ass, but they just got $300 M to go figure that shit out.

**Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice.**

In doing more research, I learned that both AMC and AMCX were seeing incredible short interest. Every resource I used reported both higher than they should be, but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers.  The ranges for AMC were between 24% of total float and 68% of total float. When I tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago, I landed at 62. Since I am retarded, the answer is probably in the 40-50. 

‚Äã
*Current short volume:* 44,670,000 shares


*True Float:*  71,000,000 shares

‚Äã
*Dollar Volume Sold Short:* $385.50 million 

‚Äã
On the last one yes, you read that right. This idiots have sold more short volume in price than the market cap of the stock. How could they do this shit all over again. They don't give a fuck. They think they will get away with it. 
‚Äã


Regardless, some idiots sold another 8,000,000 shares short ON FRIDAY. Well, I have 2500 shares across four platforms. I am buying more on Monday, but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low. Options may actually be an even better play for me because I can buy hundreds of them (thanks to this subreddit). If I exercise as many options as I can hold the stock with diamond hands, it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes don't back down.  And we know they won't . 

‚Äã
In closing, as with $GME, I have fond memories of my times at AMC as a child and teenager. It was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license. 
‚Äã
Also as with $GME, I like the stock.

1/31/21 12:10,"Barron‚Äôs... Where does your allegiance lie TL;DR Robinhood bad but DTCC and trade settlement process to blame for the fuckary that took place this week. 

Posting this article here as it seems like information worth digesting prior to the Robinhood mass exodus. Not advocating one way or the other, simply interested in the truth. To those of you that actually know... is this true? Article below:

A little-known intermediary in the process of buying and selling equities forced Robinhood and other brokers to restrict trading in several securities on Thursday, including GameStop , AMC Entertainment , BlackBerry , and Nokia . All have been swept up in the WallStreetBets-fueled short-squeeze phenomenon and have seen intense volatility in recent days.

Theories abounded online about Robinhood‚Äîa mobile-first, low-cost brokerage founded on the idea of expanding access to trading to more people‚Äîbeing in league with the ‚Äúmen in suits‚Äù at hedge funds on the losing side of those trades. Politicians on Twitter from across the political spectrum condemned the broker‚Äôs move. But Robinhood‚Äôs provided reason that it needed to restrict trading in those stocks until it could increase its collateral with the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, holds water.

Explaining that requires getting into a bit of market plumbing and elements of the trading process that usually don‚Äôt get much attention.

When an investor orders their broker‚ÄîRobinhood or E*Trade, for example‚Äîto buy or sell a security, the broker accepts the trade and sends it to an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. The exchange then matches buyers with sellers, and from the investor‚Äôs perspective, the transaction is as good as done. But there are still some mechanics that need to be worked out behind the scenes.

Investors may have noticed that the cash proceeds from selling a stock aren‚Äôt immediately available to withdraw from their account after a trade is completed‚Äîthat usually takes a business day or two. Back in the day, that time was spent physically exchanging stock certificates between brokers. Today‚Äôs trading volumes make that an impossible task.

Today, after a stock exchange completes a trade, it sends the information to the DTCC, which keeps track of brokers‚Äô books. The DTCC is a clearing house, an important part of the financial system. Clearing houses not only process and complete trades in an efficient manner, they help limit systemic risk. The clearing house promises to make good on all trades that happen regardless of what happens to an individual broker.

The DTCC is responsible for transferring ownership of the stock from the seller‚Äôs broker to the buyer‚Äôs broker‚Äîand vice versa for the cash involved. Rather than doing that after every single one of the trillions of dollars of trades each day, the DTCC waits until it can net several trades into ‚Äúone position per security, per client, per settlement date,‚Äù according to its website. The settlement date is the day when the cash and securities involved in a trade actually change hands.

At the settlement date, which falls two days after the investor places their trade, the seller‚Äôs broker must deliver the stock being sold and the buyer‚Äôs broker must provide the cash. The DTCC guarantees that the transfer will happen and eliminates the risk of a single broker going under rippling across the market.

In exchange, the DTCC collects a fee per trade and requires some collateral from the brokers to ensure they have the assets to complete the transaction. It‚Äôs like putting a refundable deposit on a purchase that reduces the middleman‚Äôs risk while the package is in the mail, with full payment due once it arrives. The DTCC‚Äôs collateral requirements for brokers are calculated by a much more complex formula, based on the specific shares‚Äô notional value, volatility, and other variables.

For a relatively risk-free transaction‚Äîin liquid, less volatile stocks like, say, Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT)‚Äîthat collateral requirement could be around the order of 10% of the transaction value. For a stock like GameStop this week, the DTCC‚Äôs formula might spit out a collateral requirement several times higher than that because it takes on greater risk. That‚Äôs because the DTCC could be on the hook to deliver an asset that‚Äôs worth a materially different amount on the settlement date than the trade date if one of the brokers involved can‚Äôt complete the transaction.

When traders are using margin to buy, the broker needs to come up with the cash on its own. And when there‚Äôs a large imbalance between a broker‚Äôs buy and sell orders for a given security, it doesn‚Äôt net out as cleanly at the end of the day, meaning more collateral is required.

All of those factors applied to Robinhood and Gamestop on Thursday. The stock traded in a wide range from $112 to $438 on heavy volume, its users were predominantly placing buy orders for the shares, and many were using margin.

And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn‚Äôt want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they need to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.

Since then, the brokerage has drawn down its credit lines at several banks and brought in $1 billion from existing investors to fund additional collateral requirements. On Friday, Robinhood reopened buying of Gamestop and other recently popular stocks.

The DTCC says it processes trillions of dollars of transactions a day, including equities, bonds, mutual funds, and derivatives. It said that collateral requirements for all of its broker clients were $33.5 billion on Thursday, up from $26 billion the day before.

1/31/21 07:33,"Road to Nowhere My story starts in 1981. After Reagan declared war on family farms and kicked out agricultural subsidies and commodities purchasing by the USDA to support family farms, it took about a year before the Farm Crisis got into full swing. My Dad made the TV news when our family dairy was the first in Northern Minnesota to be put on the block by the FDIC as they liquidated our bank to ‚Äúprotect investors‚Äù.

My father began a process of making progressively more desperate bets in order to try to support his family, sold Shaklee, was in three or four multi-level marketing schemes, sold insurance, ran a saw mill, started a small handicap equipment manufacturing company, before throwing in the towel and accepting what money I and my brother could spare him from our student loans. When I joined the Navy in desperation (abandoning college), all their utilities were cut off and he had finally given in and accepted welfare and food stamps.

Over the years, he finally got a service connected disability (Vietnam), and after my mother passed, now lives, not comfortably, but adequately. His story is finally to its ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù(?).
My road has been paved with extremely hard work, and I am doing okay, no thanks to the powers that be. Completed my service in 1992, did okay as a blue-, then white-collar person, until 2008...declared bankruptcy to save my family‚Äôs home, out the other side and finally, I think, going to make it. No retirement in our future; at least not yet; but we‚Äôre okay.

So, I hope you accept this disenfranchised Gen-Xer, and thanks for the welcome.

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right.

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)!

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70.

High short interest stocks:

GME +680%
AMC +330%
LGND +47% 
SPWR +46%
SPCE +40%
BBBY +35%
FUBO +30%

Even half blind smooth brains can see they are all mooning. But why are GME and AMC outperforming the rest? We'll come back to them later. Next up is looking at the performance of other shit on the market. I've tried to select large cap stocks and indices that are relevant to the situation, you retards can go and look up the rest and **prove me wrong.**

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th** 

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -2,2%
NASDAQ -0,5%
AAPL +3,2%
MSFT +8,5%
FB +0,5%
TSLA -5,2%
GOOGL +2,4%

What's interesting about this you say? Everything seems  normal, they're mostly flat, who the fuck cares right? You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.

Now let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.

**Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -1,14%
NASDAQ -2%
AAPL -5,3%
MSFT -1,8%
FB -7,3%
TSLA -2,5%
GOOGL -0,5%

Everything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.

I believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of üíé‚úä retards bidding up their short positions.

I believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.

Moving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more. 

In this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.

1/31/21 05:23,"Is there a legitimate case for a AMC short squeeze as people are expecting (Not much AMC DD around) Mods: I would have asked this question in the Weekend Discussion, but I haven't seen one for a while so forgive me.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is for purely educational learning purposes.*

I have some serious questions about AMC. I am concerned about the fact that the floating shares just increased because AMC let Silver Lake dump $600 million worth of shares to remove their debt. The short volume was 42mil shorted shares to 52mil floated shares in Jan 15 (last date from Marketbeat) but now I believe it will be 42mil shorted to 96mil floated shares next week. Unless the shorts are dumb enough to short those shares instead of covering, we might have an issue with the ""inevitable"" short squeeze. Unfortunately AMC doesn't have the same ""guaranteed"" short squeeze as GME.

I am wondering what everyone else thinks about the situation?

My Position: 1050 shares at $4.30

Keep in my mind I got in before the Reddit hype and right after AMC announced that they have secured enough funding to be free from the dangers of bankruptcy. I figured that by summer time as moviegoers rush to the theaters, by Q2 earnings, AMC would be trading at $6-7. I never in my wild dreams though that it would be trading almost 3x my cost basis one week after I got in lol.

I just cannot believe these CNBC, Market Insider, and other lapdog corporate media idiots are actually going on TV and in print heming and hawing about the retail trader movement behind GME and our apparent ignorance of the GME fundamentals, our apparent ignorance of having an exit strategy.

Where the hell was this staunch worship of fundamentals when shorts were borrowing against gamestop to 140% in an effort to push the price down on an equity that quite literally reached a price to book ratio of 0.40? These fucking idiots harp on about fundamentals, but don't have anything to say about a hedge fund exposing itself 10x over to try and push a stock down further than literally less than it's liquidated cash/inventory value.

Similarly, where was this concern for an exit strategy when those same hedge fund shorts were sitting at huge profits? Why didn't they take profits? Where was this concern for an exit strategy when the stock turned a corner and new boardmembers were appointed? Where was the exit strategy when Melvin, Citron, Etc lost 100% of their position, or 200%, or 500%. Where was the exit strategy when they got bailed out for 2 billion and still doubled down on the position? Where was the exit strategy when they quite literally put our equity markets on the verge of a liquidity crisis?

These fucking hypocritical idiots love to throw these things around now that one of the worst trades in history went sideways on them. Where were all these values and disciplines when they made their idiotic trade? Why didn't their prime broker force an exit strategy on them? I sure as shit know my broker would have stepped in a lot sooner. Why didn't theirs? Did their idiotic broker not realize that in a functioning market they are ultimately the last buck and bagholders in this if Melvin becomes insolvent?

The dumb fucks on the other side of this trade have miniscule risk tolerance, massive leverage, and extremely concentrated positions that risk entire hedge funds. No matter how much they try to convince us that we're in a dangerous position, the absolute worst thing that happens to us is we each lose some bullshit money in a diversified loss spread across literally millions of people. All of whom will sleep soundly at night knowing we fought a good fight. The idiots on the other side of this trade stand to lose their oligarchy.

We have more than enough people in this sub to be an influence on the outside world. We need to do something that actually highlights the good we do for our communities and people in need.

It‚Äôs hard for the media to control the narrative when we can very likely create some trend on Twitter for everyone to see. Since it‚Äôll be trending, it‚Äôs likely some of these media companies write pieces about it (because it‚Äôs a low hanging fruit story, ez clicks for them) and we start to actually change the narrative and have it resemble a bit more truth than what the people have been given so far.

This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.   


$BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.

1. Everyone who is waiting for monday to buy AMC in the hope of GME like short squeeze: what is the biggest enemy of a short squeeze? More available shares to buy rights? AMC just did another stock offering and diluted its shares. What makes you think it will still fly like GME?

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I‚Äôll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn‚Äôt believe the Sequoia part since I don‚Äôt really know what they would gain from it - they‚Äôre a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I‚Äôd be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop‚Äôs short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I‚Äôll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it‚Äôs actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn‚Äôt happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don‚Äôt know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood‚Äôs sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There‚Äôs also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn‚Äôt invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let‚Äôs get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren‚Äôt able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren‚Äôt able to trade through them. Let‚Äôs dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let‚Äôs talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There‚Äôs a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don‚Äôt want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that‚Äôs where the clearing house comes in. Let‚Äôs call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller‚Äôs side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What‚Äôs Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood‚Äôs decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here‚Äôs a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood‚Äôs decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood‚Äôs office saying ‚ÄúSuck my nuts Robinhood‚Äù
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It‚Äôs especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally ‚Äúdemocratize finance‚Äù, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood‚Äôs image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we‚Äôve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** üöÄüåù\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let‚Äôs go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I‚Äôll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

>*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  
>  
>*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
>  
>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  
>  
>*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  
>  
>*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*  
>  
>*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  
>  
>*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  
>  
>*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*  
>  
>*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*  
>  
>*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*  
>  
>*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*  
>  
>*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*  
>  
>*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*  
>  
>*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are ‚Äúhedged‚Äù by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafer‚Äù. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable ‚ÄúNet Exposure‚Äù, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN‚Äôs stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would‚Äôve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It‚Äôs very likely that if Robinhood hadn‚Äôt stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we‚Äôve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn‚Äôt look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME üöÄüåù
2. Much of the stock market‚Äôs value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) üöÄüåù the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it‚Äôs probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it‚Äôll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares.

2/1/21 09:49,"To the newcomer Just a reminder, especially if you're new here, you're not in competition with anyone else on your market account, your financial net worth, or your life.  

It's easy to look at the million dollar yolo paydays on here and get jealous, bitter, or simply disheartened at it.  Perhaps even just look at it as if it was an easy day.  But remember most didn't start with a trust fund, they started with a small amount and rolled it into a bigger amount over time.

It's easy to watch someone play a musical instrument and think it looks easy until you try.  Trading is the same way.  It looks easy but it takes time and practice to figure out a system that works for *you*.

And many here have blown their accounts up, losing *everything*, on bad bets and have had to start over.  I've even seen people get genuinely suicidal over losing it all after risking way more than they should have and ending up on the wrong side of a bet.  The stock market is an unforgiving environment, and if money or money making becomes your life you can easily lose it trying to grasp more and more.  There's way more to life than money, but if you're going to play here you need to know what you're doing and the risks involved.

Anyways, right now we're coming off a year of record gains in certain companies and sectors and it's been easy mode.  With the GME and AMC run ups of recent, it's been easy mode (thus far) even more so.  Don't think this is the norm, because it is very much ***NOT***.

After these plays are over (and one day they will be), there will be others.  You'll have to do your own homework (like DFV did for *years* before anyone knew who he was) on potential stock picks and plays.  Please be cautious of anyone who gives you stock picks and I'd actually research them.  I got into GME last year, but I did my own DD before throwing money at it.  It was a decent value play with a very high upside.  But even I didn't think we'd go this far up.

The recent run up feels a lot like the dotcom run up to me.  Different setup and scenario but similar overwhelming positive euphoria and a big draw of people who seemingly have never traded before.  This ended in some serious tears for a lot of people and years of debt or bankruptcy for some.  Getting caught up in a buying euphoria can be dangerous.  Don't let the yolo paydays here fool you, there's been yolo losses too.

WSB isn't your normal trading sub.  This is a place for high stakes bets.  All the memes and humor aside of instant paydays, Rome wasn't built in a day, and your market account probably won't be either.  If you're looking to build wealth and understand the market, this probably isn't the place.  r/finance r/investing and/or r/stocks might be better options if you're new.   Most of the major brokerages have education series on their websites and/or through their apps as well as other online sites that teach basics for free ([investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com) is a fine one imo).  You have a lot of knowledge at your fingertips if you care to learn and make use of it.   Don't be stupid.

Billboards and plans flying is great and all, but we need to leverage all these social media platforms as much as possible. If you like the stock GME or AMC or BB, then consider flooding Twitter with hashtags. 

A bs stock I can not mention (so the this can get posted) was just #2 trending on Twitter and they are taking all the hype. As much as only posting and commenting on this sub is great, we need the people who aren‚Äôt on Reddit to see that we are not the scumbags that CNBC is making us out to be. 

Take the donation stories, the DD, and Diamond hand emojis and rocket ships over to Twitter and let‚Äôs get #GMETOTHEMOON #AMCTOTHEMOON etc trending in front of these bs stocks trying to steer people away from the real prize!

Tweet that video of Jim Cramer exposing market manipulation, and let‚Äôs expose the hedge funds. We don‚Äôt need CNBC telling everyone how people here are actually using there gains for good we can tell them ourselves! 

The media is being paid by billionaires to make us out to be the bad guys. If 1/5th of the people on this sub each tweeted the same hashtag, we would be number a trending on Twitter and we would be heard!!

What do I know tho, I eat deodorant sticks.

2/1/21 08:43,"You are being played: Citadel and Point72--major hedge funds and investors in Melvin--own tons of AMC, NOK, and BB. The only squeeze that hurts them is GME üöÄ The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase.

&#x200B;

I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreet*bets* after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.

&#x200B;

After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgykmt8mqqe61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeae992d385ba8529a99e2558b270146099f7646

This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well. 

&#x200B;

Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK. 

# BB

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb), Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.

# AMC

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc) (Ctrl+F citadel or point72), Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase. 

# NOK

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/nok), Citadel owns an enormous 2,950,823 shares of, call options on, and put options on NOK, and Point72 does not own shares of NOK. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.

&#x200B;

We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.

***The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME*****.** *These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).*

&#x200B;

# Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?

The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively, *some* hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK. **BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES.

I think some soul-searching will help us to better answer such questions. We will be asked by friends sussing us because of negative press, family, etc. Some of us will even be asked these questions in court.

I asked my buddy why he went long on GME and AMC, and his answer literally blew my mind:  ""I liked the stock."" 

To me, that is a fantastic and valid reason to buy stock. I'd be really suspicious if he didn't like the stock.

2/1/21 07:41,"BLNK charging DD + short interest DD **There are many new people here, I do not want this to be a distraction. If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be ‚Äúeconomically priced‚Äù. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

&#x200B;

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**‚Äôs valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a ‚Äútotal scheme.‚Äù Left said it is ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

‚ÄúNew most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,‚Äù Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

Maybe you people calling silver a scam are the real Citadel shills. I mean, you are distracting from GME and you are trying to allocate funds to stocks that Citadel has calls in. It seems like some of you are just pushing the tickers you have positions in.

Or it could just be that these hedge funds own a little of everything. Your goal was to go after Melvin, not to prevent new plays.

2/1/21 05:46,"GME: The wrong side of the equity Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
Obligatory: I'm long a single share of GME, am not very smart, and you shouldn't take financial advice from anyone in this sub.
This is opinion only in nature and i aim only to discuss possibilities and their outcomes.

Tldr at bottom:

Okay, WSB is simply a very large pool of investors who are concerned for the capital of short sellers investors. We all individually decided that these HF's took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.

We have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF's lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.

So here's the skinny: No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren't dying from the interest yet. They are holding.

But what if their capital left?
The questions needed to be answered are

1.) ""what HF's are actively short GME, AMC, ETC. ""

2.) Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).

3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF's risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?

4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf's clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?

I'm going to guess that most people aren't aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. 

It's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.

Poke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.

Edit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding. This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out. 

Tldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions. Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate. Excluding any lock up periods",19722,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.996825218,True
2/1/21 05:03,"WSB and Gamestop are changing the financial world I‚Äôve been trying to soak up everything thats happened this last week, as it all seemed to happen so fast. I think I may have averaged about 3 hours of sleep per night, digging around the internet/twitter, following new developments, and trying my best to recognize what is actually happening here.

Millennials and relevant generations were set up for failure from the very beginning. Not only did the DotCom bubble hurt the parents of young millennials, also affecting them, but the ‚Äò08 crash totally wiped out pensions and retirement accounts, sending most all the way back to square one.

During the ‚Äò08 crash, many billionaires (who were already in the 1%) were made while the average person suffered. Since then, media coverage, guidance, and other forms of communication were heavily pushed out to the average investor to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them get back on track, while hedge funds and deep money in Wall Street were really commanding the ship.

What I‚Äôve noticed these past few weeks is a rebellion from those suppressed (common man/woman) in the form of heavy concentration on a few securities. GME, BB, NOK, AMC and others are all we ü¶ç focused on while the rest of the market was ignored. 

Futures didn‚Äôt mean shit on Friday, as GME closed ~135 points higher than it did Thursday. While this happened, shorts doubled down on the other meme stocks while limit buying ability was forced on a few brokerages. Cowardly illegal attack. However, what I saw was the mass waking up and ignoring the media, technical patterns, futures, and others means of manipulation used by Wall Street to create an emotional response within the common man. We are no longer paying attention to the tools Wall Street uses to drive the ship. In fact, us ignoring those manipulative ‚Äúindicators‚Äù only makes our autistic power even stronger. 

This week, I am giving you homework. Your homework is to continue to COMPLETELY ignore the media, futures, social media posts, etc. Who the fuck cares if futures are down 10,000 points? That indicator only
matters if you‚Äôre a üìÑü§öpig and sell your positions. We do not invest with emotion or paper hands anymore. WE decide what the stocks are worth and WE have each other‚Äôs backs, unlike the government who has handed out pennies to us on our taxed dollars.

Stick to your plan and hold with üíéüôå. If someone else sells, i‚Äôll still be holding for the next person to jump in and have a chance for battle. See all of you ü¶ç on the üåùüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",19744,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.992860973,True
2/1/21 04:26,"Schwab DD - The company who stands to gain the most out of the restriction/collusion fiasco - $SCHW **Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade and Fidelity/Vanguard** were the only large brokerages that did not lock out its users and allow massive market manipulation by Citadel.

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2)

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average.",19773,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.953603983,True

2/1/21 03:55,"This sub just bailed out two multi billion dollar companies on its own. Think about that. AMC secured $300,000,000.00 in new liquidity from the recent Reddit fallout, American Airline received $1.3 Billion. This sub appears to have saved two companies from possible bankruptcy over the last week.

It‚Äôs important to realize that when you purchase a stock, the money you pay does not go to the company, it goes to the previous owner of that share. By buying stock you‚Äôre owning a (often) tiny piece of that company from someone else, unless the company itself did a direct stock offering their own. 

If you want to inject cash into a company the best way to do this is bonds which are basically loans, but this is WSB and no one is interested in a low risk return of 4% over half a decade.

AMC and AA were able to take advantage of the insane stock surge to offer new stocks, with which they received a cash injection of 300M and 1.3B over the last week respectively.

From Bloomberg News:

*‚ÄúAmerican Airlines revealed plans on Friday to sell as much as $1.1 billion of stock through what is known as an at-the-market program, which allows companies to issue additional shares at market prices. The announcement came after their stock was up as much as 38% at its peak last week.*

*Just a couple days earlier, AMC said it had raised more than $300 million through a similar program. Investment firm Silver Lake, one of the company‚Äôs main creditors, also seized on AMC‚Äôs surge to convert $600 million of bonds into equity, before selling the shares in the open market for a gain of over $100 million.‚Äù*

That‚Äôs insane, obviously there‚Äôs others buying shares but it started on Reddit, the momentum, hype, initial rallies..... led to the bailout of two multi billion dollar companies facing the very real risk of bankruptcy. Redditors probably just saved AMC and AA which is mind blowing to realize.

What I‚Äôm here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note ‚Äì What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you‚Äôve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market.

DOCU ‚Äì Down 8.7%

F ‚Äì Down 8.6%

PINS ‚Äì Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don‚Äôt miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities.

Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

\*Full Disclosure: I do not have access to margin with my brokerage therefore limiting my ability to make this trade. I also lack the capital to do so. This post is not intended to be financial advice, rather an analysis of current market conditions.\*

2/1/21 02:24,"$BANG (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) Options Volume Analysis &#x200B;

[Top 15 Options Activity from Friday \(1\/29\/2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/50atl3uc1pe61.png?width=1373&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0b4faeda15be0c6e6cf70d0dff3a1bd9d01b0a)

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it‚Äôs also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it‚Äôs important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don‚Äôt sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don‚Äôt sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn‚Äôt above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was ‚Äúbot‚Äù propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

AMC and GME are now historic, household names. Buffett didn't sell AAPL as shares climbed and climbed. He accumulated more every time public faith in the company wavered.


There is no price target for me. I will hold these shares until someone pries them from my cold, dead üíéüëê. Asset prices will continue to climb, and there will be increasing systemic pressure to invest. When other investors see that we aren't just trying to play these stocks, but that they are icons, trophies in our war chest, they will join with us. I believe that no strategy beats buy and hold, especially when other investors believe that idea too. I won't trade this stock, I believe in what AMC represents: the rebellion against the 0.1% that will refuse to let them off easily for plundering coronavirus relief funds, causing the housing market crisis, and more.  


62 shares GME, 400 shares AMC and 3 $40 02/05 calls. To my future children reading this in 10-20 years: aren't you glad I didn't sell a single share? :) üíéüñê",19871,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.987649739,True

We have to squeeze the shorts out of their little ballsacks. We are tougher than them and there is a fuck load more of us than them. More than 4 million people joined the sub this week, do you know the kind of power we have? Wallstreetbets IS Wallstreet. We are the captain now. This is our ship and we are not letting those little hedge fund fucks take over our money. No one fucks with wsb.

Hedge funds have 48 hours to prepare for the reckoning on Monday and they think we will be sleeping with our cocks out. Not a fucking chance. We will have our cocks out alright but in their wife's mouth. wsb has no breaks we will never stop until we are on the moon. We are planning out our new civilization on the moon and no one can stop us.

We the autists of the best community on Reddit like this stonk. Elon Musk like this stonk. The world like this stonk.

There are a couple reasons we came down from that high so quickly, retail/institutional shorts were crawling all over this thing and the next day we were RESTRICTED from buying. I think there‚Äôs a lot more shorts on this than previously anticipated. Diamond hands are needed here as well as access to the open markets owe can buy and hold.

Look, I cant do the level of DD some other people do on here and others have done a great job pointing out the positives, so I‚Äôm not going to beat a dead horse. All I know is NOK is sitting near multi-year lows (like some other famous stocks were recently), its volume is picking up immensely (like some other famous stocks recently), its based in nostalgia(just like some of the stocks that went up recently) and its getting a lot of publicity which makes my pants feel kind of tight.

It has not yet popped, not even in the slightest. Don‚Äôt just cast it out of your mind because you think its worthless. That‚Äôs the same shit people did to GME when u/deepfuckingvalue mentioned it a year ago. Now those same people are eating crow while he‚Äôs bathing in fucking tendies. Will this be the same as GME?

**PUBLISHED**JAN 29, 2021 8:00AM EST

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --¬†A new class action lawsuit filed in the Central District of California alleges that behemoth online brokerage, Robinhood, breached its duties to investors when it ""willfully and knowingly"" disabled certain crucial and basic trading functions crippling its clients' abilities to trade from their accounts.

Main Street Investors

¬†The complaint alleges that Robinhood clients who owned, or sought to acquire, shares of Gamestop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), were damaged when Robinhood deliberately handcuffed their ability to trade, thereby benefitting Wall Street institutions.

According to the lawsuit, ""Robinhood, famous as the champion of the small retail investor(‚Ä¶) Switched sides."" The complaint further states that ""Robinhood acted contrary to the interests of its clients and anointed itself as the overlord of the free market, opting to damage its clients in favor of its own financial interests and the interests of other market participants, many of whom had interests directly adverse to Robinhood's clients."" The suit asserts causes of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligence and Unfair Business Practices, among others.

The case is Gossett, et al. v. Robinhood Financial, LLC, et al Case No. 21-cv-00837. The Plaintiffs are represented by Maurice Pessah of Pessah Law Group, PC (PLG) and Stuart Chelin of Chelin Law Firm, two Los Angeles based law firms.

2/1/21 21:40,"BOOM (DMC Global) Fundamentally exposed opportunity due-dil #DYOR Hey everyone!

I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.

To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren‚Äôt too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:

1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling
2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.
3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.
4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.

I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I‚Äôm a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk‚Äôs least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn‚Äôt invent this stuff. If you‚Äôre in this to change Wall Street, let‚Äôs break their trades and take back the markets.

First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it‚Äôs 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **‚ÄúHow big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs on the other side of  the trade and how deep?‚Äù** Keep these questions in mind before we move.

Secondly, **this is not long term investing** \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It‚Äôs about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn‚Äôt matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn‚Äôt matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.

Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.

After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)

1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn‚Äôt deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.
2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.
3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won‚Äôt take huge volume to squeeze this one.
4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn‚Äôt had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,
5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**

After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it‚Äôs just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won‚Äôt stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let‚Äôs make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let‚Äôs change the world, one BOOM at a time!

* [**Activate Real Time Quotes**](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/how-to-get-real-time-quotes) \- you need to acknowledge some stuff that was too long and I didn't read. If you don't do this, you're 15 minutes behind.
* [**Activate Extended Hours Trading**](http://personal.fidelity.com/webxpress/help/topics/learn_extended_hours_trading.shtml) \- Fidelity requires you speak with customer service and they talk about the risks of extended hours trading.
* **Trading on margin** \- you can call them to set up a margin trading agreement, but I don't recommend that because I'm an index fund boomer at heart.
* **Sell Limit Rules** \- Not that any of us would ever sell a stock we like so much, but Fidelity allows Sell Limits to be placed only 50% over the latest price. So we're gonna have to get well beyond $40k for us to be able to enter our $69,420.69 sell limits.

This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.

&#x200B;

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

&#x200B;

Best advice is: hold and buy more as this is just the same garbage as went on as a result of the big hedge funds getting hit in the end of last week. RobinHood are still the puppy of Citadel and will keep on making this as scary for new investors etc.

Edit 3: this is a short ladder. Just buy up paper hands and hold forever.

2/1/21 19:20,"Evidence of Massive Naked Short Selling Fraud in GME and AMC First of all, major credit to u/johnnydaggers for the [original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) If you haven't read that yet, go take a look.

Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.

I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.

(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)

I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.

[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)

Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).

I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.

# GameStop

The first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.

[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)

But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.

Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.

[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&format=png&auto=webp&s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)

Finally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (""It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!""), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!

At its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.

# AMC Entertainment

To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.

[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)

[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)

What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.

The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...

And then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.

Also like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.

# Conclusion

I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.

Where does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.

And they are thinking of dumping even more NEW shares, CRUSHING any hopes of a short squeeze, just last week **more than 44m shares were sold by Silver Lake, this is the same amount as THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD SHORT according to Ortex data as of 15th of Jan ( the most recent release) :**

[https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html)

&#x200B;

**And most of this occurred AFTER the short interest report for Jan 15, which only showed a ABSOLUTELY pitiful 15.92% Short Interest, and only 1.21 days to cover, and cost to borrow being incredibly low - see the Ortex panel. I'd post a pic here from my account but I can't upload it at the moment. This was never high enough for a squeeze, now with all these new shares on the market or about to hit it you HONESTLY STILL THINK THERE WILL BE A SQUEEZE? STILL?** 

**SILVER has about the same chance now of squeezing as AMC!**

\----------

This is getting beyond a joke. The current price was clearly a result of baseless hype and people assuming it is still going to short squeeze. This is clearly all but a lie at this point. The company will trend back to it's fundamental value of around 2$ -$3 ( the broker consensus on IB) very quickly, as soon as people realize it's not going to squeeze anymore. This was what the price targets were when the company was talking about the real possibility of bankruptcy only about two weeks ago ( see SEC filings ). They won't go bankrupt now, at least in the near term, because they issued a shit ton of shares during the short mania, but this still leaves around 5.1 Billion in debt, and a company losing more than 100 million a month thanks to Covid.

If you are looking for a afterparty to join after GME, AMC definitely isn't it.

\---------

**TLDR:**

**Don't suck others into this failing short squeeze just because got sucked in by the hypetrain and want to sell the stock you bought at 17-20$ to some other poor bastard who knows even less than you do about short squeezes.**

Poistions:

Put spreads, such as  OTM bearish butterflys, verticals, and diagonals. Basically however I can get some negative deltas on this thing without paying to much in IV.

2/2/21 16:00,"Stake suspending buys on GME AMC NOK Forgive me for knowing less about this than my toaster does. Anyone here got a couple of brain cells to rub together and form a view?

From Stake:

We have just received notification, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, will not be able to offer Buys on GameStop ($GME), AMC Entertainment ($AMC) and Nokia ($NOK) due to increased capital requirements set by the DTC. 
Any buy orders on any of these symbols made after Monday‚Äôs close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open Tuesday.
To be clear, this is not a decision Stake has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the securities they make available. As such, we are unable to confirm when this may change.
If you‚Äôd like to understand more about the DTC and capital requirements, we‚Äôve provided more information below.
When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. 
The clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.
The required amount of capital guarantee is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of the above symbols, the DTC has enforced an increase of 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners.
DriveWealth have decided not to take on the large capital risk that comes with this significant increase.  We‚Äôll update you if this changes.
This percentage of capital required to be held against a stock is a variable level that is stock specific.  It is calculated through a value at risk model (more detail on the formula is available from page 57 here). Most simply, it‚Äôs a function of the riskiness of a security ‚Äì being gap risk, historical market volatility and trading volumes in individual stocks. 
As you can see in highly volatile markets, capital requirements rise. When paired with increased trade volumes as has recently been the case, many brokers have understandably not had the balance sheet flexibility to cater to the new requirements. Highly volatile stocks such as GME and AMC currently carry a 100% cash collateral requirement.
All transactions are settled by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). Under normal circumstances, a DTC member is required to allocate a certain percentage of their balance sheet capital to settle such trades in advance with NSCC.
During last Thursday‚Äôs session, aggregate capital requirements rose from US$26b to US$33.5b across all brokerages. While DriveWealth was able to cater to new requirements, further increase has meant DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in $GME and $AMC (each stock has its own capital requirement rather a broker wide requirement).

2/2/21 15:38,"Great info on TWNK. I did not write this!! Just copied.. Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies)

I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/), but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.

# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won‚Äôt see a squeeze of GME‚Äôs magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call ‚Äúasymmetric upside‚Äù (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I‚Äôll describe below.

**So what‚Äôs the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can‚Äôt make this up)‚Ä¶

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there‚Äôs no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what‚Äôs the thesis?** We think there‚Äôs an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** ‚Äì Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we‚Äôre aware of (can‚Äôt really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** ‚Äì Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you‚Äôre looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** ‚Äì There‚Äôs actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing ‚Äì and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells cr√®me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the ‚Äúbetter-for-you‚Äù snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess‚Äô existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company‚Äôs primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company‚Äôs largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don‚Äôt think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you‚Äôre looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from other holdings you may have. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts.

Let‚Äôs be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

**Orladeyo - The Prelude**

Orladeyo has recently been approved in the [US](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) and [Japan](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biocryst-bcrx-wins-japanese-approval-for-hae-drug-orladeyo-2021-01-25) to treat Hereditary Angioedema(European approval expected shortly). HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive. It costs [$485,000/year in the US](https://endpts.com/biocryst-wins-approval-for-hae-pill-and-charges-half-a-million-dollars-but-will-anyone-take-it/#:~:text=Six%20years%20after%20the%20FDA,BioCryst%20has%20notched%20another%20approval.&text=Despite%20inferior%20efficacy%2C%20BioCryst%20will,had%20projected%20a%20%24300%2C000%20tag.) and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU. The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market [(page 15)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/bcd71bf3-ef71-4803-81c4-edd4e33ebb38).

FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding [commercial biotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393550-biocryst-time-to-switch-hats-mid-cap-fits-now-maybe-large-cap) now engaged in execution.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. They‚Äôre small targets like ‚ÄúLupus‚Äù and ‚ÄúIGA Nephropathy‚Äù along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and it‚Äôs already being hailed as [‚Äúbest in class‚Äù](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So what‚Äôs this look like money wise?  Alexion‚Äôs drugs SOLIRIS¬Æ and ULTOMIRIS¬Æ are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.

**Galidesivir - The Wild Card**

If you aren‚Äôt already excited, maybe you‚Äôll be excited by a drug [that provides 90% protection against Ebola](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320203179_Efficacy_of_Galidesivir_against_Ebola_Virus_Disease_in_Rhesus_Monkeys) when dosed 72 hours post exposure. Huge Ebola outbreak? BioTerror attack in a major city?  Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes? No problem. Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didn‚Äôt we already have this drug?  That‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this.

But, in case you haven‚Äôt found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called [FOP](https://www.biocryst.com/our-pipeline/fop-program/). It slowly (and painfully) cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11.

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCryst‚Äôs expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.  

Disease: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris (both IVF C5 inhibitors) to treat the rare blood disorder PNH. Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris. [This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [‚Äúobsolete‚Äù](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, there‚Äôs not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

I ran this calculation after seeing different AMC short interest figures on various websites. ***I believe true AMC short interest is actually 10-15%***, which is significantly lower than what Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, etc. are saying (79% on Market Watch, 38% on Yahoo Finance, at the time of writing this post).

**Since AMC's Q3‚Äô20 filing which was released on 11/05/20, they‚Äôve issued a shit ton of shares through the below means, which I don't think these finance websites are accounting for:**

1. Raising $917mm in debt and equity through December and January; in a 1/22/201 filing they stated they had 287.3mm Class A shares outstanding ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html))

3. Upcoming automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares held by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese investor, represents 46.1mm new Class A shares that will hit the market soon (page S-18, [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf)).
4. Additionally, last week AMC filed to sell an additional 50mm Class A shares into the market ([http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf))

**Here is my calculation for short interest, including links to filings from the Company for reference:**

1. (A) 287,276,558 Class A Common Stock Outstanding as of 1/22/2021 + (B) 51,796,784 Class B Common Stock will automatically convert to Class A Common Stock at 1:1 ratio because on 12/14/2020 Dalian Wanda Group's holdings of Class B Common Stock fell to 30% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock + (C) AMC filed to sell an additional 50,000,00 Class A Common Stock into the market -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf), page 1 and page S-18
2. Silver Lake Group converted $600mm of Convertible Senior Secured Notes into 44,422,860 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Silver Lake then sold all those shares into the market last week. 5,666,000 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding then got cancelled as part of this conversion -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf), page 2 || [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf), page 12
3. Looks like \~44.7mm shares are sold short
4. Total shares outstanding (excl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing) = 287,276,558 + 44,422,860 = 331,699,418
5. Total shares outstanding (incl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing (which they will probably complete given the high stock price)) = 331,699,418 + 51,796,784 - 5,666,000 + 50,000,000 = 427,830,202
6. Looks like \~3.0 shares are held by management / insiders, so float and short interest on #4 above = 328,704,636 / 13.6% short interest; and on #5 above = 424,835,420 / 10.5% short interest

***In summary, I think AMC is way overhyped and those looking for a short squeeze may still realize one, but at a much lower magnitude than they might believe. Focus should be on forcing the GME short squeeze, which still looks to have +100% short interest.***

Appreciate any and all discussion. My thoughts are my own, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** I updated the link reference for AMC filing to issue another 50mm shares into the market.

**Edit 2:**

I've been getting some questions on why Yahoo Finance and Market Watch are wrong. Here are my thoughts:

We are all using the same number of shares short, so it's a matter of how you calculate shares outstanding and float. My guess is these free, generic finance websites use a very standard method of calculating short interest and apply it to all companies. They're not reading through filings and fine-tuning their calculations to be specific to each company.

**Yahoo Finance** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): In Footnote 5, they state Shares Outstanding (and then I ASSUME Float as well) is based off the most recent quarterly or annual report. Their 287.28mm shares lines up with my #1. So it doesn't include Silver Lake's conversion of debt to equity, Dalian Wanda's upcoming conversion of Class B to Class A shares, or AMC's filing to sell an additional 50mm shares last week.

**Market Watch** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): I can't figure out how they calculate 56.57mm public float, but their shares outstanding are the same 287.28mm as my #1. So even in the worst case scenario, if you believe my more conservative shares outstanding calculation of 331.7mm (point #5 instead of #6 to be conservative), that's an extra 44.4mm shares, which when added to Market Watch's float of 56.57mm shares, equals 100.97mm shares in the float and thus 44.3% short interest, which is significantly lower than the 79.0% they're showing. But still, I don't necessarily agree with their float calculation and can't figure out how they get to 56.57mm.",21011,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.987436652,True

That's the message that all 8 million of us should be spreading right now.  I full expect each and every one of you to write to the SEC about what is happening.  The HF's may have the money, but we have the voice!

2/2/21 12:59,"Why are we holding AMC? They are no longer on the SEC's ""failure to deliver"" list after January 12th I feel like I got played so hard and it's all my fault for not doing my own research. Let this be a warning to all STOP PUTTING ALL FAITH INTO THE HIVE MIND AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. GME is clearly on SEC's ""failure to deliver list"" on every day provided meaning they are still most likely being shorted, but AMC is apparently cleared after the 12th meaning they are probably no longer being shorted.

January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $2.12

January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $2.01

January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $2.01

January 9-12th - AMC not on list

January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $2.20

January 13-14th - AMC - not on list

I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the ""shorters"" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want

All you retards held however the stock still fell. Why?

Manipulation? Maybe.
But how do you beat the hedge and make the stonk go higher? 

You need to buy 

Let me explain

Imagine there‚Äôs a pie with four slices three slices are called for this increasing the price of the fourth slice. 
Overtime that slice gets traded higher and higher until there‚Äôs not many buyers resulting in low liquidity. 

Then one retard tries to trade that fourth slice of pie and can‚Äôt find a customer and sells at a loss and multiply that thousands and millions of times and the price keeps falling.

Along with that factor in RH and other platforms limiting buying and the buying and selling becomes imbalanced and basic economic supply and demand kick in. High supply low demand or low liquidity = lower prices. 

Finally add in bunch of retards switching trading platforms. Their money is going to be locked up for few days and if they‚Äôre transferring their shares or options it‚Äôll be about a weeks time frame. Meaning they won‚Äôt be able to do anything in that time further hurting the share price. 

So how do we counter all these factors? 

All you apes need to keep buying at market price. The more people buy at asking price the higher the stock goes. Don‚Äôt buy NOK, AMC, BB or anything else. Stick to GME. If you‚Äôre not willing to do that then this is over.

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- (2) To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, any security not so registered, or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/ https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction.""

I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

After reading this post by u/johnnydaggers

GME: https://i.imgur.com/dvqlgib.png 

AMC: https://i.imgur.com/OLymQ4j.png

For both these stocks the failure to delivers are off the charts in recent history, and those increases in failures seem to correlate with suppressed pricing.  Now there may be legit reasons for a failure to happen, and without knowing which firms caused these failures we can't truly draw any conclusions other than *something is fucky*.


We can pretty easily generate a corresponding chart for any symbol with this:

2/2/21 10:21,"Fubo stock on track to hit $200 Over the past few weeks, fuboTV has been caught up in the huge short-squeeze rattling through the markets because, well, the stock is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market.

In the first half of December, fuboTV‚Äôs stock more than doubled over two weeks on the back of super-strong subscriber numbers. The strength in fuboTV‚Äôs subscriber base broadly foreshadows its huge role in the live TV streaming world.

On the heels of that huge rally, multiple short-sellers targeted FUBO. The favored argument amongst bears is that demand for live TV is dying, the streaming platform itself is commoditized and the business model is built on broken economics. Fubo‚Äôs short interest currently sits at about 65% of the float.

Then, the Reddit-inspired short-squeeze broke out. It wasn‚Äôt just GME stock that went flying. All heavily shorted stocks flew alongside GME stock. FUBO stock, with 65% of its float sold short, was a beneficiary of the rising tide in heavily shorted names.

But, this week, many of these short squeeze stocks have plunged.

Not FUBO stock ‚Äî and that‚Äôs because fuboTV is no GameStop or AMC.

## Unlike GameStop, fuboTV Is Fundamentally Strong

FuboTV ‚Äî unlike many of the other heavily shorted companies that soared last week ‚Äî is supported by very strong fundamentals and has a long runway for profitable growth ahead.

Here‚Äôs the story.

Media consumption is pivoting from linear TV to streaming TV because the latter is cheaper, more flexible, and more convenient. Yet, even though **Netflix** has reached ubiquity among U.S. households, most households still pay for cable TV, because Netflix doesn‚Äôt have live sports, live programming or news ‚Äî three things which Americans still love to watch.

That‚Äôs why a new generation of live TV streaming services has emerged over the past decade. These services take live TV content, and package it into a streaming service ‚Äî somewhat like a ‚ÄúNetflix for TV‚Äù. Because demand for live TV is robust and because streaming TV offers significant advantages over linear TV, these live TV streaming services represent the future of TV and will one day be as commonplace in households as cable TV is today.

fuboTV is one of these live TV streaming services. It‚Äôs differentiation is that it is a sports-focused live TV streaming platform. That is, the company is hyper-focused on acquiring exclusive sports content and launching a digital sportsbook to enable dynamic sports betting through its live TV streaming platform.

In other words, fuboTV projects as a live TV streaming service purpose-built for sports super-fans and gamblers.

That‚Äôs a large audience. About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.

Thus, fuboTV projects as a streaming platform that will one day have tens of millions of paid subscribers. It has just 500,000 paid subs today.

The runway for growth here is very long ‚Äî and consequently, the potential upside in FUBO stock is very big.

## FuboTV Stock to $200?

My numbers indicate that FUBO stock will soar to $200 over the next several years.

Here are those numbers.

I broadly assume that fuboTV can scale to \~10 million paid subscribers by 2030. I think that average revenue per subscriber per month can grow to about $70, assisted by ad revenue growth and sports betting revenue growth. That implies around $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.

I see EBITDA margins running towards 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.

Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030.

Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.

## Bottom Line on FUBO Stock

Not all short squeeze stocks are created equal. On one hand, you have GME stock and AMC stock, who have tons of short squeeze firepower but very weak fundamentals. On the other hand, you have FUBO stock, who has almost as much short-squeeze firepower and strong fundamentals, too.

That‚Äôs a powerful combination which should sustain the current uptrend in FUBO stock not just for the next few days ‚Äî but for the next few years, as well.",21337,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999540925,True

I just turned 27 last week right when this all started and for my birthday I got a knife in the back from Vlad Tenev, Robinhood and the suits. 

I almost didn‚Äôt go to school because of money struggles growing up. It took me six years to get my bachelors degree: first community college then transferred to a university. I graduated two years ago and I‚Äôve been struggling to find a stable job and Covid did not help. I went through many interviews this year, but was denied over and over or positions were dissolved mid-way through the hiring process because of company redirection. It has really sucked, and I‚Äôm sure many of you have gone through same thing. 

For nearly 2 months I was hovering around $100 in bank account and doing grub-hub to pay for my bills. In October I started working in a distribution center...busting my ass until I get a career role. Fortunately, I am in another interview process for an awesome company and position.

I know it‚Äôs irresponsible of me to throw everything I‚Äôve made over the past few months into these companies. But I believe in what is happening and this community. This is bigger than money. What the suits have done is unforgivable. Although I am still up pretty well, it does look bad right now, but we still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen. I‚Äôve come to terms with the potential loss and all the work I‚Äôve done to get here, but I am HOLDING.

I have been in way worse financial positions and I‚Äôve always made it out. Robinhood chose not to do what was right. I will be okay and you will be okay.

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is extremely memeable, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

Twinkies to the moon: [https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue](https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue)

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won‚Äôt see a squeeze of GME‚Äôs magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call ‚Äúasymmetric upside‚Äù (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I‚Äôll describe below.

**So what‚Äôs the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can‚Äôt make this up)‚Ä¶now they‚Äôre going to make us some Tendies‚Ñ¢ as well.

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there‚Äôs no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what‚Äôs the thesis?** We think there‚Äôs an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** ‚Äì Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we‚Äôre aware of (can‚Äôt really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** ‚Äì Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If you‚Äôre looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** ‚Äì There‚Äôs actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing ‚Äì and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells cr√®me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the ‚Äúbetter-for-you‚Äù snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess‚Äô existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company‚Äôs primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company‚Äôs largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don‚Äôt think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you‚Äôre looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***",21504,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.990485966,True

2/2/21 09:09,"‚ÄòMeme Stock‚Äô Volatility and the Real Winners   

First of all, this is somewhat of a long post and I hope you all enjoy it. I hope this can start some discussion.

**Tldr:** The 'Reddit Raid' has impacted the overall economy in positive ways that we could not have predicted. We have been the lifeline that these companies needed. $AMC and $GME have benefited greatly from the rise of their common equity. **Winners: Institutional Investors, Companies, Employees, Real Estate (and local communities).**

Over the past 2 weeks we have seen retail investors from around the world making significant gains on various ‚ÄòMeme stocks‚Äô. Stocks like $GME, $AMC have seen massive price appreciation as the under-served and under-represented members of society have found a new interest in investing. News outlets continue to post sensational articles on individual people becoming rich overnight because of early investments in these companies. However, the real winners out of all of this are the companies themselves, various institutional investors, employees of these companies, and real estate companies (and local communities).

**Winners**

**Institutional Investors:**

Silver Lake Partners ‚Äì Silver Lake Partners is a private equity group that up until recently, had been a credit investor with $AMC. Originally owning $600 Million worth of convertible bonds back in 2018, Silver Lake disclosed on Friday January 29th that they had converted their $600 Million worth of bonds into $AMC shares and subsequently sold those shares for a $113 Million profit. This convertible bond event also dramatically benefited $AMC through the obvious reduction in debt during a tenuous operating environment (more on that later).

$GME Shareholders ‚Äì It may be a surprise to many media outlets but institutional investors have made a sizeable gain when it comes to $GME shares. Fidelity, Black Rock, and Vanguard own 13.7%, 12.3%, and 7.6% of shares outstanding respectively. This has led to a gain of $2.9 Billion, $2.6 Billion, and $1.6 Billion respectively for each of these institutional investors. 

Ontario Teachers Pension Fund ‚Äì The recent retail action in favour of mall REIT Macerich ($MAC) led to the largest shareholder; the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund, cashing out for $500 Million which has helped boost capital available for the pension obligations of the teachers paying into this pension fund.

**Companies:**

$AMC - Due to the convertible bond action I highlighted earlier with regards to Silver Lake Partners, AMC saw an immediate reduction in the company‚Äôs debt by $600 Million dollars as the credit investor opted to take common equity instead. This reduced AMC‚Äôs debt burden and in turn has allowed them to look more favorable in the eyes of the credit market. The reduction in debt also helps AMC navigate the challenging operating environment that has been brought about by the pandemic and the restrictions. Two weeks ago, AMC was also able to raise $917 Million by tapping debt and equity markets which helped stave off concerns of bankruptcy. 

I suspect that $GME will conduct an equity offering in hopes of raising cash to pay down debt. 

These developments have been extremely beneficial to both $AMC and $GME and may have prevented bankruptcy of both businesses. At the end of the day I don‚Äôt want to see either business go under because of the compounding effects it has on the livelihoods of employees, the real estate market, and general blight on communities if in fact their brick and mortar spaces became vacant. 

**Employees:** 

$GME has 14,000 full time and 42,000 part time employees (as of 2019).

$AMC has 4,408 full time and 36,000 part time employees (as of 2018).

The survival of these companies mean that these people still have a livelihood and this avoids adding more to the already substantially high unemployment numbers nationally. 

**Real Estate:**

$GME has 5,509 brick and mortar locations.

$AMC has 1,004 brick and mortar locations.

The survival of these companies mean that real estate companies avoid large vacancies and communities avoid blighted zones of lost business.

The events of the past few weeks have been the lifeline that was needed and I hope these businesses can be turned around. Godspeed.",21570,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.99966979,True
2/2/21 08:59,"Emotional involvement has never been this high, please understand the risk involved. taken from r/investing, full credit to OP u/MasterCookSwag. wanted to post it here because i love this subreddit, and i think some of y'all need to read this. 

&#x200B;

First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments.

I'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week. A lot more than normal. And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here. So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose. Short, long, whatever. It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife. Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money.

And a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.

To the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation. I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else. What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.

So let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath. It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance. It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop):

>Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect‚ÄîI certainly expected‚Äîto see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.  
>  
>But here‚Äôs what Citadel Securities‚Äô retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1  
>  
>[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)  
>  
>Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.  
>  
>What do you make of that? One reading would be: ‚ÄúRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they‚Äôre not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.‚Äù Or as one Twitter user put it, ‚Äúpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.‚Äù

So, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.

**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  
You, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened. You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices. You simply don't know. You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.

This thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks. You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it. Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.

**Emotions** The problem with this whole ""strike back at wall street"" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade. Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt. This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars. So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending.

Want to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet. But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.

TLDR:

1. know and understand who is playing this game. And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not. You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner.
2. Short squeezes end fast. As fast as they started. If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.
3. Get your emotions out of play here. This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes. Can't handle that? then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.

Lastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole ""fight the hedge funds"" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back. If that's worth it to you then have at it. But don't fool yourself in to thinking otherwise.",21612,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998198569,True

**Dear Retard**

We are in the midst of an unfolding situation in global markets which is attracting a significant number of new traders to trading platforms to buy particular stocks in a coordinated way.

This has caused a significant increase in trading volumes and demands on our platform. As a result of this some clients have experienced disruption to service. This has fallen short of the high standards we set ourselves and the service you deserve. For those clients who have experienced disruption, I would like to offer you my sincere apologies, and assure you we are addressing these issues as a matter of urgency.

We took a number of steps immediately and continue to implement additional measures to avoid any further disruption:

If you have emailed the helpdesk we will get back to you.3.We have temporarily paused new account opening so that we can focus on providing our existing clients with the service they deserve.

**We have also made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend new trading on GameStop and AMC Entertainment**.

If you don't sell, the price won't go down. Buy and hold on mass can make everyone, especially the initial investors very rich. It is the basis for the recent gains in tech. The public sentiment is creating value in many of these companies. Just look at ZM. It's a direct consequence of democratized trading and it will become more and more influential. 


Everyone has the misconception that a stock's price is determined by some true value+potential of the company. In fact, the potential of a company is actually in part a function of stock price. This means that a large group of buyers of the stock can directly fund as well as motivate managers and CEOs to stay interested in building a successful company. I'm sure the new management doesn't want to squander our support. The price is a barometer of public reputation which is a strong indicator of longevity. That's what the market wants most in the end. 

Democratizing trading will allow publicly popular companies to redeem themselves financially. In a sense, it is a safety net of public faith. If gamestop management can capitalize on our support, the is real potential it can turn itself around. I spoke to a relative of mine who was a former manager at a gamestop who said that the new management dreams of turning stores into social hubs like Starbuck's. By cultivating a friendly environment for gamers, they can capitalize on an open market. This will be especially successful if a roaring 20s type decade unfolds (assuming the vaccine is successful in stopping the virus, which it is poised to do so far according to researchers like Nicholas Christakis at Yale).  This would ensure gamestop becomes a physical environment of the gaming community for the foreseeable future, occupying a niche I think no other company is better positioned to seize. 


I say let's fund that dream and reap the spoils.

I feel like the reason we are losing this battle is because people are getting panicked and they are selling their shares to recover their investments.

And not to forget about the fact that the media is portraying the WSB group as a bunch of evils.
So now the next question for the average joe is what should i do? I mean people need to relax a little and swallow that chill pill. 
You bought some shares on platform X and cant trade them - hold hold hold and try to find platform Y where trading is not banned. If you can, buy some on platform Y but dont sell the ones on plat.X
If we can all hold together, we can win this battle and create history.

‚ÄúTrading Update for GME and AMC
Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.

While we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause, this is not a decision Revolut has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the stocks they make available. We will however keep you informed as and when this situation changes.

For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME nor AMC will appear in search. Please check the email we are sending out to all Revolut Trading Ltd customers for additional information about this situation.‚Äù",22114,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.968098342,True

From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: **GME**) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: **AMC**) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  


### What does this mean for me?

You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday‚Äôs (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.

None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.  


For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you‚Äôre not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you‚Äôll be able to see them in the app.

### Why is this happening?

When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  


The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners.  


This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.

### When will they be available again to buy?

This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

2/3/21 01:45,"Why GME and AMC holders need to be looking at on balance volume to have an idea of what's going on with these volume and price movements. A little helpful DD **Newbies**, skip this paragraph. **Non-newbies** (and people who actually bothered to do 5 minutes of research about volume price movements), the **tl;dr** is that the gradient for OBV is not proportional to the gradient of the price decrease, indicating a bullish divergence. 

I got a few PMs about my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laww2w/legit_proud_of_all_of_you_for_not_selling_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and what that little blue line called on balance volume, or OBV means. OBV basically gets a positive or negative value based on if the prices are going up, or going down at that time. So in theory, when price rises, OBV should rise at the same rate to that increase, and vice versa. 

However, the useful thing about OBV is in the name - it's weighted by volume. This means the more shares that are bought/sold, the steeper the OBV line (or gradient). So in this gamestop selling run, we would expect such a crazy price decrease to be followed by a similarly crazy decrease in on balance volume, since a lot of shares would not be in the hands of retail investors, theoretically. However, the OBV line has barely moved. What this means is that the price has decreased far below what most people are holding it for, comparing it to the first OBV rise last week when everyone bought into GME. This in turn means that the price is being changed by barely anything, and it really hangs in the balance of a few trades right now.

**But what are the statistics???**

In today's price drop we saw 5 million shares negatively impact OBV against a total balance of 1.1 billion, that's a factor of 0.5% and is microscopic compared to a daily increasing rate of 25% last week. That's why everyone here is going on about volume - there isn't any. If you're still confused, go on tradingview and bring up the on balance volume indicator, and look at the past 7 trading days.

Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.

What does this mean for me?
You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday‚Äôs (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.

None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.

For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you‚Äôre not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you‚Äôll be able to see them in the app.

Why is this happening?
When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.

The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners.

This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.

When will they be available again to buy?
This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

2/3/21 04:37,"CRSR Earnings Next Week, Could Mean üöÄüöÄüöÄ First things first, I'm not a Melvin or Citadel bot trying to divert your attention from the squeeze play. I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)

Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).

I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.

Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.

After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)

In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday. 

Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.

TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.

This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I‚Äôm excited about, and I‚Äôd love some feedback.

Mudrick Capital Management earned 9.8% in January, one of
its best months ever, making the bulk of its gains on debt and equity options of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn‚Äôt public. The firm also profited from the volatility in shares of GameStop Corp.
The $3.1 billion hedge fund booked most of the gains on its debt holdings in AMC and about $50 million selling out-of-the-money call options on the stock last week, the person said. The shares surged more than 500% in January before retreating sharply Tuesday. Mudrick also profited by selling out-of-the-money call options on GameStop, the person said. A spokesman for New York-based Mudrick declined to comment.

It's my opinion that these hedgies didn't liquidate long positions in order to cover shorts just yet, but instead to short all of our favourites in order to pay for the impending squeeze and recoup losses.

Look at AMC, BB, NOK, PLTR, etc. All of them were shorted hard and fast this morning, and once SSR was tripped they setup sell pressure walls to hold that price until they can short into the bid again. *Overcoming this wall requires a lot of buy volume that just isn't there right now, we're spread to thin.*

Remember that SSR is tripped when shorted beyond 10%, and for the remainder of that trading day and the following trading day the shorter's can only sell above the strike. This is also known as the uptick rule. 

It's almost as if there was some kind of backroom meeting to coordinate an effort to short our most mentioned and beloved tickers. A lot of these hedge funds would have shorted BlackBerry when it was at $10, so why wouldn't they liquidate positions in their longs and short it when it is at 22? For those unaware, shorter's make money by keeping the difference between the strike they sold the borrowed chair at and the strike they purchase it back at minus of course fees and interest. Allowing them to push this stuff down is making them money.

""Here‚Äôs An Example Of How To Short A Stock

For example, let‚Äôs say ABC stock is currently trading at $10. After doing your research and due diligence (DD) you think that ABC stock could fall to $5 a share. You will then contact your broker, and your broker will lend you shares of ABC stock that you will then sell in the open market. In this example, let‚Äôs say you short 10 shares of stock.¬†

So, after selling those 10 borrowed shares of stock, you now have net positive $100 cash in your account. Next, ABC stock drops to $5 a share the following week. You will then do what‚Äôs called ‚Äúcover your short position‚Äù by buying the stock back. In this case, you buy back at $5. Lastly, you will pay your lender back the shares you borrowed and profit the difference. So with 10 shares as the example, you, as the investor, would profit $50 shorting ABC stock from $10 to $5 a share.¬†

It‚Äôs crucial to note that, despite some investors having made their fortunes by short selling, it‚Äôs considered a high-risk investment strategy. The reason being is because short selling has infinite risk. In simpler terms, the amount you can lose by shorting a stock is unlimited.""

What we are seeing today is the HFs trying lower the price of GME in order to scare retail investors. They squeeze has not been squoze.

(insert a lot of rocket emojis, diamond hands and all that.)

I am a degenerate and this is no investment advice. Do your own DD and don't spam me. I increased my GME position today at 80$. But what do I know? I just buy GME and today it was cheeper than yesterday.

2/3/21 02:58,"All ""WSB stocks"" are being treated the same by the media. They're not the same. The media has been covering WSB absolutely atrociously. WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)

**GME: The squeezening**

GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze. 

Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words: **we like the stock**

There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now. 

**AMC: GME's little brother**

AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.

AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.

**BB: Not GME**

Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:

https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751

BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-software/blackberry-launches-cybersecurity-software-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1F42LX

And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary. 

Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing. 

**NOK: Definitely not GME**

NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html

Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $4.50 right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $5.50 by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board. 

**SLV: Not a WSB stock**

I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results. 

Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the ""WSB stocks"" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.

**ALL THAT SAID**

If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other ""WSB stocks"" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share. 

**TL;DR**: GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play. FUCK SLV.",22879,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.987910628,True

2/3/21 02:10,"Simpleton Version So let's put it in simple words so everyone has a clear picture of what's happening. 

The float is the number of tradable shares of a company's stock. 

1) Melvin and his chums shorted 140% of the float. Since stock is issued by the company, and short sellers have to borrow stock to conduct their business, this means they shorted 40% more than the number of shares that were ever issued. So, being greedy, they borrowed fake shares to short to really kick the company in the balls. 

2) Even after shorting 140%, Melvin still lost $6 billion give or take. Also, Melvin is owned by Citadel, who doesn't like that their baby lost. 

3) So.. Citadel turns to his other, uglier child called Robinloot (Citadel gives Robinloot 40% of their allowance), and tells him to stop letting everyone buy more shares, only sell. 

4) Citadel get's all major media outlets to report that Reddit buyers are flocking to Silver to try and divert away from GME and AMC. Luckily, we have the internet and phones and this isn't the 90's with dial up. So for some of those pricks who went to school for journalism and paid $60k to study how to write a fucking article, could just open this page and see that WSB was in fact saying they didn't buy Silver. 

5) Citadel also owns almost 0.98% of SLV ETF, is one of the largest buyers of calls and also owns large amounts of shares in more than 10 other instruments tracking silver. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 

Citadel is conveniently related to every single part of what's going on. 

I didn't move from a third world country to deal with this kind of bullshit and open corruption and market manipulation. What the fuck.

In the past couple of weeks our sub count has almost doubled. What does this mean? It means that purely by the numbers, our favourite fucking subreddit is no longer only comprised of autists. We can fix this in one of two ways: we boot all the new joiners, or welcome them in our little autistic dinosaur arms and force autism into their ass like a gay Harvey Weinstein.

Right now, this autist is leaning toward the former. All this horseshit about ""sticking it to the suits"" is driving my cue ball brain up the fucking wall. What the fuck do you mean? Squeeze out the 2 funds that are short so you can shit money for the other 30 fucking funds that are long? Don't give me some bullshit that there's actual justice being done here. It's only about the fucking money. You retarded fucking bagholders are only telling people to buy because you can't accept your portfolio looking like Donald Trump's colon.

There's also the unlimited supply of dogshit here every day now about how GME and AMC are fundamentally worth their spiked prices. Isn't this against rule 7 of the sub? GME was visibly failing and AMC was billions in debt even before the pandemic. Buy whatever the fuck you want, but WSB doesn't endorse making shit up about fundamentals you don't understand. Saying ""this isn't financial advice"" in your post means nothing. Confirmation bias at this level opens the SEC to investigate us for market manipulation.

And finally, to the new guys in our midst: if you came to this sub hoping to make money, you were fucking retarded and get the fuck out. Go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) or some shit. Here, making money has only ever been second to memes.

I am retarded. I did really good on the whole AMC and GME craze, got cocky, and fucked up everything on horrible calls with no research. Well I won‚Äôt do that again. Now I‚Äôll fuck up money while doing lots of research so I have no excuse and feel even shittier.

Any way, as you can see from this fucking crayon drawing, now is a good time to buy ELY. The blue curvy line is not just a representation of my floppy dick, but also the 21 adaptive EMA moving average. Stonks love moving average and it‚Äôs about touching now so buy it might be gud idea. It might dip a little below I guess, the average is not a fucking time machine or a crystal ball.

Since December there has been support at around 22-23 dollars, and the resistance is obviously at 30 right now. High end price target is $40 with earnings coming up.

Now im new and obviously retarded so like...my crayon drawing probably doesnt mean shit but stonks supposedly love the average and we aren‚Äôt way above or below right now. I am highly considering selling everything i‚Äôm bag holding, which will come out to between 700-800 if I sold everything tomorrow no matter what lol and going in on calls.

That‚Äôs obviously not a big move for shares and I want to build the base up so calls it will most likely be. I have one 2/19 $31c right now at $1.39 premium. Probably go for 30‚Äôs if I ‚Äúyolo‚Äù on this. I know it‚Äôs small money for now, fuck you im paying tuition.

One thing that is concerning is volume is low, but if wsb autists get on board, maybe we can do something.

What‚Äôs about to happen is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting stocks. 

The hedge fund hatches a plan. Market markers and hedgefund friends are going to use stocks that they own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, they are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system can‚Äôt recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system, sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore think the supply is high. 

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesn‚Äôt matter though, since you as someone who is holding isn‚Äôt selling at that price. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the price is at if no one is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its multiple stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low. 

Why is this important? It is important because the hedge funds need to buy your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy your stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. If they can‚Äôt buy, they can‚Äôt close their shorts. If they can‚Äôt close their shorts, they‚Äôll have to pay interest. And if the interest becomes too much, they are going to be forced to buy your stocks at whatever price you offer. This is the squeeze. 

The squeeze starts when the hedge fund can‚Äôt afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. They‚Äôll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells until 1000usd, they are going to be forced to pay that. If no one sells until 10000usd, they‚Äôll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions, they will flood the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However, if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isn‚Äôt the actual price. It‚Äôs the price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. If everyone holds, there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesn‚Äôt matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS TO BUY FROM so they can‚Äôt close their positions, they‚Äôll have to keep paying for the interest and at some point, they WILL have to BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the price.",23459,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.597340763,True

2/3/21 12:30,"Let's talk about taxes: both realized gains and realized losses (USA only) I know everybody is getting super excited about GME, AMC, NOK, or BB going üöÄüöÄüöÄ, but have you thought about taxes? I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.

**LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:**

I know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to **REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL**. You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can **only deduct up to $3,000 per year** ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year. **(Please see edit below for losses >$3,000).**

**CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):**

There are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (<=1 year) and long term (>1 year).

Short term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.

**Marginal Rates:** For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:

* 35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);
* 22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);
* 12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).
* The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $9,950 or less ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).

These are just general information. Please consult with a tax advisor as everyone's financial situations are different.

Also: there's a handful of you making donations which is freaking awesome. You should save those receipts as those donations can also be used to deduct your taxes.

2/3/21 12:28,"How to prevent your $GME shares from being used for short ladder attacks Fellow apes:

Thanks to [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6aiq/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_03_2021/glt6vxo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from /u/Guildish, I was prompted to look into how to prevent my $GME shares from being used by hedge funds for the short ladder attacks we've been seeing these past couple days. Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:

[https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html](https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)

Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!

Edit 2: I‚Äôve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn‚Äôt make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I‚Äôll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I‚Äôve never had any issues with them, and they don‚Äôt limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.

Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can‚Äôt be made. I‚Äôm not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that, it‚Äôs okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.

Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to ‚Äúpay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account‚Äù. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I‚Äôm not an expert.

2/3/21 12:07,"$AMC - Why I'm holding for the long term With AMC, it's been a battered stock for a while due to the pandemic and their debt issues - it's tough to make a buck when the government basically shuts down your business.  But... I've been looking at this stock for a while.  Then I saw Silver Lake Group LLC convert their $600 million of convertible notes into equity, so they obviously saw value in the stock at \~$13; That was enough for me to pick up about 1400 shares \~ $15 in January.

The short squeeze could have gone either way, so it was a bet I was willing to make.  Had it gone up to $100 due to a short squeeze I'd be happy - if it got crushed by the HF/Media/RH/Revolut and their manipulative fuckery (which is apparently where we're sitting now) then I'd still hold and grab some popcorn (Hopefully you all have realized that RH was never free, you were their product and we know who their masters are now).  Two years ago this was a $20 stock, and in the last 5 years it's had an ATH of $35.  Predictions are that we're going to see most of the vaccinations occur and a significant lifting of restrictions in time for Summer movie season - and the studios should have some decent blockbusters in the can where we see a big lift to movie theater attendance as us apes emerge from their caves where we have practically lived for 15 months, so assuming AMC stays out of bankruptcy (which is pretty likely at this point), even without a short squeeze this is a stock I can see popping back up to $20-$25 by Fall.  They still have their infrastructure, distribution, recliner seats, IMAX and dine-in options.  AMC is one of the top vendors for IMAX with a potential sector growth CAGR of 34% in 2021 because we're going to see increased customer spending and a demand for a high quality movie experience that Direct to Home (DTH) just can't match.  Lets face it, teenagers are still going to want to take their dates to dinner an a movie.

It's not flashy or as exciting as the GME spike, but long term it's still a good money making opportunity and holding long term or buying the dip still has the potential to see green by the end of the year.  

A lot of HF still have this in their scopes and you can see their short interest is still high, but this is more than just a chance to F the HFs, this is also a good value play on a stock they've been battering.

Anyway, besides that fact I want to get some insight on what your plans for the next few days are? 

First let me start off by saying that I have not sold a single share of GME OR AMC. I am holding both. But I did have 55x $5 calls for AMC that I sold on expiration day (Jan 29th) which netted me a very healthy profit. 

I feel as if the true squeeze has not yet even begun. In the back of my mind I have this crazy theory that the market makers and hedge funds deliberately and illegally drove the price down for one main reason. They now want to be apart of the squeeze as well. 

I mean from a financial standpoint why would they not want to make thousands of % of gains? When instead they can only make 100% when they short. 

They are starting to realize the true power behind this movement, they know that it is not going to be easily stopped and the main squeeze is inevitable.

Now what do bagholders do? Well frankly you have 2 options here. Option #1 is, continue to hold your bags patiently and wait until the moon. Option #2 continue to hold your bags and wait until we land on fucking Pluto 

Now there is also a option #3 and that option is to close your position and take whatever money you have left and run. This option sucks donkey ducks. And in turn will probably cause you life long depression when and if we squeeze to astronomical heights. 

Now, I say this with a heavy heart, but if you sold.... Your a bitch. If you feel stupid for buying in, then you probably are. We all know what the risks are. Who buys a stock that goes from $2 to $500 in a matter of days and then wonders why it dropped? You, you bitch. Do not be clueless, do not let this demotivate you. You don‚Äôt lose until you sell. You still have your shares. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you paid for them at this point because if you bought at $500 you 10000% were not planning on selling at $525 or even $575. So nothing here has changed. Wait until the real squeeze.

I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few ""good"" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.

Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share ""Box Office"" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.

Okay, that seems weird but what about this other stuff? like the fact that there are supposed to be a total of 69,000,000 shares outstanding, yet over 61,000,000 shares are shorted? is it really possible for there to be less than 8,000,000 shares that aren't being shorted? and if that was the case wouldn't there be no way for us (retail investors) to bring the price up at all? ü§îü§îü§î

Also, the short percentage of the float is 226.42% for Gamestop when I did research into the other top shorted stocks, Bed Bath and Beyond was mentioned so I decided to check their statistics versus Gamestop, and their percentage of the float was 82%. 

So i decided to compare the numbers of the Top 5 ‚ÄúBest Heavily Shorted Stocks To Buy Right Now‚Äù from Nasdaq.com üìà

just look at the stats: 

AMC üéû

Shares Outstanding: 287.28M
% Held By Insiders: 2.30%
% Held by Institutions: 37.24% 
Shares Short: 44.67M
Short % of Float: 38.12%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 20.67%

GME üéÆ

Shares Outstanding: 69.75M
% Held By Insiders: 27.33%
% Held by Institutions: 122.04%
Shares Short: 61.78M 
Short % of Float: 226.42%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 88.58%

BBBY üß¥

Shares Outstanding: 121.22M
% Held By Insiders: 5.76%
% Held by Institutions: 117.88%
Shares Short: 74.89M
Short % of Float: 82.41%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 61.78%

SPCE üöÄ

Shares Outstanding: 234.34M
% Held By Insiders: 40%
% Held by Institutions: 29.72%
Shares Short: 38.6M 
Short % of Float: 56.15%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 16.47%

FUBO üì∫

Shares Outstanding: 108.85M
% Held By Insiders: 17.38%
% Held by Institutions: 7.24%
Shares Short: 39.17M
Short % of Float: 72.74%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 57.98%

As you can see Gamestop (GME) has the least amount of shares outstanding (by far) of any of these stocks, yet has the second most number of shares shorted behind BBBY which has almost DOUBLE the amount of shares outstanding. 

So, 
AMC has 15.5% of it‚Äôs total shares shorted
BBBY has 61.7% of its total shares shorted
FUBO has 35.98% of its total shares shorted
SPCE has 16.47% of its total shares shorted

But GME has 88.57% of it‚Äôs shares shorted!?!?!?!?

Look, I am not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice, and I may be just a retard, but this retard thinks that everything going on with Gamestop is not just unsusal but downright strange. 

Is there any explanation that someone can give me that explains why GME is being shorted SO MUCH, and why it‚Äôs stats are like that? üôåüèªüíé",23787,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999610484,True
2/3/21 09:27,"PSA: the market does not care about your feelings, fairness, or even legality We have gained so many new people over the past week, I feel like this needs to be said.

GameStop is falling. Whether the hedge funds covering is legal or not doesn‚Äôt matter. If it‚Äôs done illegally, they‚Äôll get a slap on the wrist, a 1-10mil fine, and chalk it up as a net gain vs what they would have lost.

Robinhood and other brokers rigged the game against us, and that‚Äôs it. They might get a slap on the wrist, maybe some will have to remove certain features, but that‚Äôs it.

There won‚Äôt be a great retribution. There probably won‚Äôt be ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Sometimes you just lose money. This is the danger of fomo and looking at the market as a get rich quick scheme. MOST people lose when they do this, only a few win, and usually you have to be in early enough to win anything substantial.

Sometimes being a retard pays off, but most of the time you just lose. There is almost never some some great conspiracy theory. Almost always it‚Äôs just an L.

GameStop ran up over 1000% in a month. It‚Äôs very likely we‚Äôve already experienced the short squeeze. 

AMC issued 50million additional shares at the peak which essentially wiped out all short squeeze potential.

There is a ton of money to be made with our collective minds, but spending your energy justifying GameStop is not the way to make that money. If you genuinely think that the short sellers are not currently covering their positions at the prices over the past 2 days then you‚Äôre delusional.

2/3/21 09:16,"Why GME is still in the game to trigger MOASS (MUST-READ BULLET POINTS) Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

2/4/21 03:43,"Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director \*Not Financial Advice. Entertainment purposes only.   
I work in the film & tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state. 

But recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.

**Quick Facts:**  
1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.   
2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.  
**And here's the banger:**  
3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected 1.5-billion), Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these. 

This is bad for the studies because their ""great"" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day. 

**Pent-Up Demand:**  
Box office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to 5.5-billion in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions). 

When Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand. 

If the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers 

**Another possibility:**  
If Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC. 

TL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC.",24007,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.997724116,True

You've made your point, the whole world is now watching you and this moment has been immortalized in history. Those Evil Boomer HFs, they've closed their shorts, but are now being replaced by new shorts. How did they manage to do that with the relatively small exchange volume ? Legally they can do it via dark-pools or going directly to the institutional longs; Illegally by counterfeiting shares. But as it stands, with the borrow rate decreasing and no significant share loan recall, there is not enough pressure to trigger large shorts covering.

2/4/21 01:12,"On bots and bullshit We are all aware of the massive influx of bots, and the amount of misinformation floating around is ridiculous.

I think the issue now is that we are seeing the results of the bot sentiment manipulation being taken up by users. I see some pretty well written posts where people are spreading misinformation etc. Probably because they have picked up on s\*\*\* the bots have been spreading.

I'm worried not only that this misinformation campaign is damaging the credibility of WSB and the movement we are all a part of (now), but that it's going to cost a lot of people, a lot of f\*\*\*ing money!

I think the proof of this manipulation can be seen here:

[https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment)

Look at GME:

https://preview.redd.it/agcrmf5ez9f61.jpg?width=1416&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=739ef4d292f5ec34272af751c3e5f4061a9fcb6e

Sentiment was high all along, even when the price was low. People were following along for the ride with DFV etc.

&#x200B;

Now look at BB, NOK and AMC:

https://preview.redd.it/njti4bqez9f61.jpg?width=1443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f1291162768f229735aa5105f7057a83a553d31

All of them, the sentiment lags the spike like a mofo, and it's insanely positive. These tickers were hardly even being discussed before GME kicked off. This suggests that the initial sentiment came from outside wsb and then likely people got caught up in the craziness, fueled by bots spamming these tickers to draw attention away from $GME.

And it worked. I only got in when we were at about 1.6m members so I am still new, but at that time, people were posting exactly that: ""Ignore AMC, NOK and BB, it just draws focus away from the main play: GME"".

Now there may be fundamental reasons why people believe in the other tickers, but I really think GME is a once in a lifetime opportunity. People are getting caught up in the hype around the others, and it is now self perpetuating. People have sunk costs in AMC. NOK and BB and are trying to hype them back up to the peaks.

All this is doing is playing into the hedgefunds hands.

&#x200B;

Also, bonus SLV chart:

https://preview.redd.it/jc1lbv3qz9f61.jpg?width=1461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5fbde8278aef2079cc348a5e91aa4a05b323d2c

This f\*\*\*er is crazy. Look at how that flood of comments coincides almost perfectly with the peak, and now SLV is trading 10% below where it rallied.

&#x200B;

People are losing money due to the sentiment attacks across the board.

There also seems to be a growing portion of users comparing anyone still holding $GME and talking about the blatant lies, manipulation and outright criminality of the hedge funds, to f\*\*\*ing QAnon.

Now I'm not being funny, but I think the concept of billionaire cronies trying every dirty trick in the book to screw the little guy back down into place is a FAR more credible concept than the idea that those same billionaires are all pedophiles who eat children FFS.

I'm not saying that every single cry of ""short ladder attack"" is correct, and that there aren't some crack pot theories going around based on reading public data sets entirely wrong and jumping to insane conclusions

BUT the pure fact is, there is some shady shit going down in plain view and we need to be aware of it and stop letting it divide us.

Having said all that, I'm just a tin-foil hat wearing smooth brain who does rainbow s\*\*\*s after eating crayons so you know, make up your own mind.

TLDR: Bots are manipulating the f\*\*\* out of sentiment here and elsewhere.

Also, as if it wasn't obvious, I'm holding 56 GME @ 135.08

2/3/21 22:41,"GameStop Update 5: The Unpopular Truth In the most recent update in the GameStop Saga GME has crashed from $450 per share to around $90 per share with a 50%+ crash yesterday.

Here is Why:

The GameStop Short/Gamma Squeeze worked because we had 3 things on our side

1. Surprise: We were underestimated in the capital we could bring to the table
2. Focus: A huge focus of our readers was on a single Stonk
3. Momentum: Fast growing crowd and upswing.

However in the past few days we lost all 3.

1. Surprise: The surprise was clearly gone, the second the news started reporting on us. This is theoretically ok as losing the element of surprise could be replaced by an increase in both focus and momentum. This was especially important because of the volume of short interest initially.
2. Focus: Our bets went from a laser focus on a $200m GME to a spread out focus into AMC, NOK, Etc. This was when we needed the focus the most, as GME's market cap rose over $20 Billion
3. Momentum: This was literally stopped dead in its tracks the second that the brokerages pulled our ability to purchase more shares. This is not something that we could have expected, it was a fundamental shift in the rules of the game, but it happened.

This is not to say GME won't or can't go to the moon, this is to say that in order for GME to move forward there would need to be a different set of elements that would need to come together.

You are welcome to hate on the post, disagree with my logic or just not agree with I am saying. But, for this and future plays I think it is important for people to be thoughtful of what caused the run up and where we are today.

Why did Trade Republic stop buy orders for stocks like GameStop or AMC on Thursday?

We started the last week with new highs in transactions, active customers and without any problems. On Thursday, shortly after 7:30 a.m., our trading venue Lang & Schwarz Exchange (LSX) suffered from a significant outage. This was due to database overloads at one of LSX's service providers. We then switched to our fallback trading venue Tradegate Exchange. After a few hours, the tremendous increase of orders in stocks such as GameStop or AMC led to delays in the execution of orders. Trading had to be temporarily suspended to increase capacity.

Trading started again in the afternoon. This was followed by another heavy load on the systems with several thousand orders per minute. To prevent further outages, we decided not to accept any buy orders for six stocks, including GameStop and AMC, after the XETRA close at 5:30 p.m. We decided to do this to ensure the availability of our service for our customers. There were concerns that there could have been rapid declines in prices for stocks such as GameStop and AMC in the wake of particularly high volatility. Technical delays could have resulted in losses for you. That‚Äôs what we were referring to when mentioning ‚Äúrisks to you‚Äù in our first message.


Why did Trade Republic block only buy and not sell orders for those six stocks?

Essentially, the additional number of orders for those six stocks overloaded the systems. However, we wanted to continue to allow sell transactions. It was important to us to give customers who held those highly volatile stocks the opportunity to sell the shares to take profits or limit losses.


Why was the limitation of trading lifted again on Friday?

We worked through the night and our team massively scaled up our resources. Our tests have shown that the systems remain stable even with a considerable order load. As a result, we decided to start full trading on Friday before the market opened at 7:30 a.m. On Friday we again saw peak activities but our systems ran without problems.


Why do you say in the first message that you want to protect the customers from risks?

Trade Republic stands for free access to the capital market and offers various asset classes. We do not want to tell our users what to invest in. Our first message to our customers was misleading. We did not distinguish well enough between the explanation (technical risks) and the information (risks of volatile stocks). At Trade Republic, many people are investing their money in stocks for the first time. Due to the unique events in the markets, we wanted to inform about the risks associated with volatile stocks for our customers who are invested in those. More risk information will be added to the app in the future.


Has BaFin ordered the resumption of trading?

No. Trade Republic is in constant exchange with the BaFin. Trade Republic has informed BaFin about the steps mentioned above. The decision to resume trading was made independently by Trade Republic. Contrary to media claims, Trade Republic was not admonished about non-compliance with regulation by the BaFin on Thursday. Following incidents and outages, Trade Republic continues to report to the supervisory authority and provides comprehensive information on the case.


Can something like this happen again?

Our systems easily coped with the maximum load of trading last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as Friday. Without the technical error of the service provider at Lang & Schwarz Exchange, Thursday would have also been a quiet, normal day. As a result, we have greatly increased our server capacity and load testing. At the same time, we are investing massively in our technical infrastructure to improve our offering further.


Has Trade Republic responded to third-party pressure? Does Trade Republic have relationships with hedge funds?

No. Trade Republic has never had and does not have any relationships with hedge funds or similar market participants. The decision was made by Trade Republic independently and only from a technical point of view.


Did Trade Republic respond to pressure from clearing houses? Were there liquidity bottlenecks?

No. Trade Republic settles all transactions with HSBC - one of the largest settlement providers in the world. There were no limitations in clearing & settlement in any way. Trade Republic does not have to maintain liquidity for clearing.


Does Trade Republic sell data to hedge funds so they can trade against it to make money (""frontrunning"")?

No. Trade Republic conducts its trades through the Hamburg Stock Exchange which is controlled by a supervisory authority appointed by the Hamburg Senate. Trade Republic does not sell any data to third parties. Trading takes place at reference market prices, e.g. from XETRA. Different to what is claimed in the media, the business model of Trade Republic is not comparable to the model of Robinhood.


Does Trade Republic lend out my securities?

No. Trade Republic never lends out securities.

2/3/21 15:11,"$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read üòå 9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let‚Äôs look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME‚Äôs short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! üëÄ Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger‚Äôs new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let‚Äôs hope he get‚Äôs it right with $SKT. üôèüèæ

2/3/21 14:26,"DO NOT BUY CALLS IN MARGIN ACCOUNT !!! It's obvious that stocks like GME and AMC are prime targets for short sellers who want to bring the price down.

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' ""lendable shares"" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

Some of you may have read my last posts regarding investing in BB long term as well as other stocks that dipped during GME‚Äôs rise. Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.

I probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can‚Äôt focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.

Many, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don‚Äôt trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.

This is how a stop loss works in simple terms:

1. monkey buys share for $100 each.
2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, the monkey selects ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop on Quote‚Äù and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell
3. Confirm order

Congrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.

‚ÄúOh, but why would I buy high sell low?‚Äù Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.

It is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúIM NOT FUCKING SELLING.‚Äù That‚Äôs great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.

First, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today‚Äôs price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).

‚ÄúBut Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!‚Äù yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not? Well then, I hope this information helps.

(this is not financial advice)

TL;DR ‚Äì Stop Loss good. Max Loss Bad.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Your comments reveal how little a lot of you know about trading. Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn't going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of ""only invest what you are willing to lose"" is completely misapplied here. 

If you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000. How about you invest $5000 and set a stop loss at $4000. Same loss, but much higher potential gains. ",25137,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.997826159,True

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty threads‚Äîor very early mornings shitposts‚Äîwhen I checked WSB half-crazy and, instead of cashing out, aimed the big $1650 Robinhood account towards GameStop at $325 per share, wearing cummed-stained shorts and a ramen-stained shirt. . .chucking rent money into AMC at $16 per share, not quite sure what my exit strategy was (always stalling at the sell button, too autistic to take profits while I fumbled for more YOLO money) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I traded I would come to a place where people were just as retarded and üíé ‚úãed as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any stonk, at any hour. If not across GME, then in AMC or BB or NOK. . . . You could strike tendies anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

Our autism would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting‚Äîon our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of GameStop, a high and beautiful wave. . . .

Important information about your options expiring 2/5

Hi Kaitlin,

We‚Äôre reaching out to you because you have GME and/or AMC options expiring this Friday and our standard sellout procedures have been adjusted to account for increased volatility in the underlying equities.

Because of this, on Friday, your GME and/or AMC options expiring 2/5 may be at a higher chance than usual of being closed out if you are unable or choose not to close them out yourself.

We understand this may be frustrating to hear, but we want to be transparent with you and keep you informed.

How does this affect me?

If we determine that your option contract is at risk of being in the money and you don‚Äôt maintain the necessary collateral to support assignment/exercise, we may take proactive measures to help reduce your account risk, including closing at-risk positions prior to expiration date.¬†This may also include, but isn‚Äôt limited to, spread positions with a theoretical max gain/loss.

Please note that having the collateral to place the trade is different from having the collateral to support exercise/assignment.",25429,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.997738957,True

This has been suggested before here, so be like Koko, don't throw shit, relay your concerns like the cultured apes we are.

""Thank you for writing to me with your concerns regarding the trading of stocks like GME and AMC. Your thoughts on these important matters are most welcome and appreciated.

As you mentioned, after an unexpected surge in gains for stocks such as GME, certain financial services institutions and trading platforms suspended the trading of this and other stocks on January 28, 2020. These trading restrictions have since raised questions regarding the legality of barring smaller, retail investors from participating in stock trading during periods of volatility. Like you, I have serious concerns about brokerage platforms putting in place restrictions, which limit the free trading of stocks and options, especially when those restrictions disproportionately benefit large hedge fund operators at the expense of individual investors.

In recent years, online brokerage platforms have made the stock market more accessible to individual retail investors. While this progress is important in allowing everyday Americans the freedom to make their own investment decisions, it's important that these platforms allow their users to participate on an equal playing field with the large banks, funds, and institutional investors that have dominated the stock market for decades.

You may be interested to know that I am a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. Given that this subcommittee is responsible for funding the operations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), I have a unique opportunity to engage with this agency on recent market volatility. In the coming weeks, I look forward to the opportunity to question the SEC Chair on the handling of this situation and will keep your concerns in mind as I have those discussions. The SEC must help provide answers to the thousands of retail investors who may have been harmed by the surprise restrictions put in place on January 28th. ""

The reality is 60-80% of options trades lose CFD trades are about 60% losing. Shares trades I have no fucking idea but probably more than 50% lose.

Why is this a problem? Because last / this week the guys internalizing the trades got fucking rodgered, their loss porn would have made post on here look like fucking lunch money in 1982.

2/4/21 20:53,"Are retail shorters actually helping us out? [Theory] I have a bit of a theory that I believe that retail shorters are actually helping us out, hear me out.

Not a financial advisor, just an ape with a dream to visit the moon.

This is regarding AMC, but could also apply for GME's current situation.

AMC currently has a reported short interest of 80% with free float of 56m shares. That means that about 44.8m of the shares in the free float have short contracts against them.

The current price drop that we saw, as funds and TUTs are trying to cover their asses, will only attract other retail shorters and institutional shorters who would bet that the price would drop even further, betting against it dropping $8 for example (For AMC).

However, what they are doing in the process is they are occupying the another % of the free float into shares that have short contracts against them - further lowering the total amount of shares that can be bought back by funds and tuts as there are fewer shares available to trade.

I feel like, not only are funds trying to make paper hands to sell their shares which they hold, so there's more supply in the market that will allow to cover the demand without spiking the price like crazy, but also they are trying to lower the price to a point where retail shorters would exercise their short contracts and return a % of the shares back into the public float.

If we were to look at a hypothetical:

Let's say that there are currently 100 shares (float). 80% of them are held by institutions as short interest - they have borrowed them and sold them in the market. That means that tuts need to buy back at least 80% of the float of the market to return to their ""owner"".

Let's hypothetically say that we, retail investors and institutional investors, own 15% of the free float. But what happens with retail shorters who enter the market, borrow existing shares (presumably from the 15% that we occupy to sell and return to the market. Let's say that they are currently taking up another 10% of the shares. Occupying an even higher amount of shares in the free float with short contracts against them. So, they borrow the shares that were already a part of the supply from the institutional shorters who sold in the market and was consequently bought from a retail investor or institutional investor. If the retail shorters buy back the shares that they have shorted, to return, that's fine for institutional shorters as the float is in their advantage. But if the price does not drop to a point that is comfortable for retail shorters, that leaves them with even less of wiggle room where they will have to buy at an even higher price than the market price.

So in the case of our example of 100 shares, that means that now they have 90% of shares in the float that have short contracts against them with 15% ownership. Meaning that 5% of the shares need to be bought back from second demand instead of primary demand - thus driving the price at which they can buy them back further up, thus further increasing the price of the stock, thus causing the institutional shorters to pay an even higher price, which will further drive up the market price.

Does this make any sense? I kind of suck at explaining shit.

That or I'm just full of shit.

My point being **(TL:DR)** is that, institutional shorters need to drive the price down further not only to make us sell, but to also incentivise retail shorters into exercising their contracts and thus returning the supply back to meet demand, otherwise that would lead to an even higher price jump.

Regardless, I'm holding. I believe in the cause and if it exposes market makers and institutional ownership of our ""free market"" at the cost of me losing some money (that i'm comfortable losing), then it's a win in my book.

I like the stock. I have spoken.

P.S This is not financial advise. I am not trying to create expectation, but I just have a speculation. The more we talk about this as a collective, the more educated decisions people on this board can make. After all, we are acting as an open access hedge fund at this point lol.

2/4/21 20:39,"Lets Look at GME from a NON-BIAS standpoint **THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVICE I AM NOT A PROFFESIONAL SO PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL.**

***I will simplify this very easily so new retards can understand this simply.***

1. Short Interest: ***This is ultimately why we got in***. **I don't care if you like the stock or not. We all want money at the end of the day, and that's the truth.** We really want those who shorted the shares to finally buyback the shares. The interest rate did drop from 140 to 120. This was a guarantee on the robinhood fiasco day. **That was only 20%**. And we got the confirmation from multiple sources. I am using highshortinterest.com which I do understand is not updated as frequently but it did update on that day. It comes as a huge surprise to me that 120 dropped to 51%. Either they bought it from other hedge funds at a background deal, or the day Robinhood manipulated the prices down, that rise up was the shorts selling. Thus we got back to 300ish from the low of 110. In this case, it has squeezed. **In the case it hasn't, the shorts are actually screwed if we just hold (we need a short interest update with actual legitimate facts, I do not know where to get this information besides the website stated. Do not listen to S3 partners, as they have gone back and forth with bs. Its an estimate)**

&#x200B;

2) **GME & AMC are following the exact same pattern**. This is a huge sign of manipulation. Although that shouldnt come as a surprise. When Robinhood let traders sell, shorts were able to cover for cheap as fuck. **THEY COMPLETELY SCREWED THE MOMENTUM, HOWEVER THIS CAN EASILY CHANGE, AS THERE ARE MORE BUYERS THEN SELLERS.**

3) **Silver diversion**: Let me just say this. GME AND AMC are basically the same situation but different Short interest. **If they wanted to divert from GME, they should of said we moved to AMC. But no they specifically mentioned silver. That is a huge sign, and this cannot be understated more that they want to close the movement.** You really need to think about how the news is reflecting this, and how it still continues to reflect it.

4)  GME is still testing grounds: GME is actually hovering 80-100. Like actually??? How is this even possible. We are still in the squeeze.  **If it crashed we would actually be at 40 right now.**

5) Short Ladder attacks: I was super hesitant to believe this shit. There's no actual sources, but we do have crammer in a video saying what hedge funds do in desperate circumstances.  The legimatacy of short ladder attacks is comparable to the following: This is basically like saying the assassination of Kennedy was not an actual hit, and when cocaine was brought into America, we just didn't have the resources to stop it from coming.

**I AM GOING TO BE HONEST, people definitely paper handed at this short ladder attack**. **This would actually bring their short interest down a bit, while keeping the stock price at a safe level.**

&#x200B;

6) **People are on our side. Listen carefully. We can actually win. I was retarded and thought this was going to be easy.** Of course it wasn't gonna be. Did you know why the Volkswagen short squeeze happened? Because one smart dude decided to hold and not sell, forcing high interest rates and shorts getting margin called. This is inevitable if we drive the price back up, they will be forced to buyback the shares.  **WE ALSO HAVE THAT ONE DIAMOND BALLS FCKER> DFV.**

We've been told to hold, and I'm continuing to do so, until we go to the moon. But when can we expect to see some actual hedge fund action, that is when are they forced to actually make good on their bets? I was told they were due all days this week and that everyone should hold until at least Friday (some said Thursday, today), can we expect the squeeze to happen today or tomorrow, or are we right now just holding to fuck with the hedge funds (which I have no trouble doing)?

They weren't prepared to handle that sudden rush of customers and now they're sifting through accounts activating them, receiving funds, etc.

I don't think the week will end well for GME (and by that I mean its not going to start going up). I think next week is going to be a bull run when trading companies work through the weekend to clear up the back log of new customers.

Also, has everyone forgotten about BB and AMC? I expect a rally for AMC coming soon.

Right now for the reason of the movement, but here is another major reason why I know it, and other theaters will blow.

Think about it, the future of workmanship, UBI, AI taking over jobs, it will pressure society to rethink what it means to live and enjoy life in the next 10 years.

What does one do if they have free money, no work, and the desire to do SOMETHING?

They do one (or more) of 3 major things:

- They learn / explore
- They socialize / connect
- They have fun / seek entertainment

AMC is step 3 of this societal change, but most importantly, step 2 as well. It resolves the human desire to both socialize and be entertained.

That is why I am convinced things like digital/physical entertainment will blow up like mad. It seems trivial, but old school physical theatres are going to be huge as we go back to our roots. There is also a massive opportunity in VR as well.

What are your thoughts on entertainment stocks outside of this movement?

Edit: To add, I think this interest for physical entertainment will never die down as humanity advances because once we peak in terms of mobile / VR technology, we will be far more intrigued to go back to our roots. Its for this reason that physical sports will never die. The reason athletes arent just hopping on digital hockey, soccer, football etc.",25625,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998612761,True

2/4/21 17:20,"Can we agree that Fidelity‚Äôs App is hot garbage Hello fellow autists ü¶ç. I come before you today to enlist your help in submitting a formal request to Fidelity to fix that God awful thing they call an app. 

After last week‚Äôs obvious attempt to thwart retail investors I decided to take my talents to Fidelity, and by talents I mean net loss portfolio. By the way, dont be me. While transferring your portfolio your stocks are frozen so you lose the ability to sell your stocks. So if GME and AMC had skyrocketed to 1,000,000,000 and then quickly shot back down to $0.01 during the transfer, I literally wouldve had to say GG. The squeeze would have been squoze ladies and ladies. Dont. Do. What. I. Did. Just wait for this all to be over then bounce they way GME will bounce then head for the moon.

Anyway, now that i‚Äôm on Fidelity, im happy to be on a platform that actually looks out for the little guy and doesnt mind the poor steal from the rich but jesus christ is this user interface GARBAGE. To check your positions and watchlist you have to engage with a Microsoft Excel-like sliding page which is a pain. You also have to change your account setting (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8zg30/fidelity_users_beware/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)post) when you create it in order to get live charts as opposed to the default 15-minute late charts that you open your account . And even if they were live charts, on the app the charts themselves are nothing compared to that of Robinhood‚Äôs charts. (Honestly none of that matters because I cant read anyway)

But seriously until the app gets a makeover i‚Äôll probably end up using Robinhood just to look at charts and Fidelity to enter. I know it‚Äôs a pain in the ass but i‚Äôm hardheaded and wanna feeling like im sticking it to ‚Äúthe man‚Äù.

So again, I ask that as a unit we make something shake and actually get Fidelity to make their app more user friendly for us retarded folk.

Retail traders in this instance is made out to be a failure, (despite confidence in AMC) it's a con or a snake, even media I sow willing sold to their benefit as their corporate mob, to rape society.
While the SEC instead act to negate the improper conduct of instrument holders as a third party interest AKA Hedge fund and in part brokers.
The SEC announced two days ago they were looking to make sure retail trades were not manipulated, while allowing SEC LICENSED HEDGE FUNDS TO RAPE RETAIL TRADES driving the stock of AMC down 10% mid day but failed to initiate the SSR rule.
Brokers being given the availability of Hedges for gain, and the SEC in allowing Hedges to short beyond market demand/capability until the resources were tuned on them.
For what purpose such greed that risks the economic stability of the nation and global concerns? A promise to another form of investor?.....Equality my ass. What stance does the SEC now make to protect by what standard of investor?

They are truly a meme or willfully hindering proper oversight, I vote the later.
Should not the SEC now be held accountable (and be legally bind to recoup losses on behalf of all retail traders? without a specific fine other than being a proper legal award?) in regard to fines of hedge funds improper behaviors?

2/5/21 04:24,"MAJOR Issue with Robinhood account transfer to TD Ameritrade. Hello everyone. I am super stressed out, and wanted to get this out to see if anyone is experiencing the same issue. 

January 28 was the date where Robinhood started to restrict sales for GME, AMC, and others. I was holding GME, AMC, and BB, and sold them all before the crash later that day. Paper hands, yeah yeah, but I'm not made of money.

I shared the universal frustration towards Robinhood that the entire internet felt that day and since, and decided to transfer my entire account from Robinhood to TD Ameritrade. I sold the meme stocks, but was still holding my long-terms. I went to TD Ameritrade and submitted the transfer.

About a week passes, and I wake up this morning to check if my transfer was completed. Robinhood FUCKING transfered GME, BB, and AMC to my TD AMERITRADE ACCOUNT AFTER I HAD SOLD THEM! And my transfer was only half completed as well. There was also a negative cash balance of $1000 in my TD Ameritrade account.

On the Robinhood side of things, I had negative shares(yes, negative shares) of all the meme stocks in my portfolio. All of a sudden, around 10:30 the negative shares disappeared and Robinhood RE BOUGHT the shares on my behalf to cancel the negative shares out even though my account was still technically ""deactivated"". Now, I have a negative buying power of $-500 in Robinhood, along with the $-1000 in TD. 

I called TD Ameritrade(Where you can actually speak to a real person.., unlike Robinhood) and they said that this was entirely Robinhood's error. The woman I spoke to said she has seen thousands of Robinhood transfers get fucked up because of their doing, and that I have to go to RH's support to resolve it. The only problem is Robinhood's support is incompetent and will probably take days to email me back. 

I just wanted to post this for two reasons. The first is to see if anyone else has experienced this, and the second is to serve as a PSA of NOT to transfer your account from RH to anywhere. Liquidate your stocks into cash, fund your bank, then fund your new brokerage. It's what I should've done, now I need to either wait till RH resolves this shit or lawyer up.

By now I think it's safe to assume that most people have sold their GME shares. Oh, I'm sure a few die-hards will jump in to tell me they're never selling, but 90% of us have moved on. That's fine.


So...what did we learn?


-----


**THE GOOD**


**Shares, Not Options**


Who would've thought, right? Oh, sure, a lot of us had a few options and made a killing off those, but the majority of the money made on GME was in shares. Obviously, the short squeeze potential drove that more than anything, but I think it's important to look at why else it worked.


GME brought in a LOT of new investors who know nothing about the market. I bet 99% of people don't know how to buy options or how they work. But anyone can buy shares. And buying shares probably saved a ton of us from buying FDs and blowing up our accounts early. So when GME was initially surging from $30 to $100, we kept buying shares instead of going for the home run.


I think that's something to keep in mind on any future plays. We all love our options, but shares were key to this for more than just the squeeze.


**We Moved the Market**


GameStop was obviously the big one, but AMC and Express were saved from bankruptcy. We brought attention to BlackBerry, which just needed a little bump and is a legitimate company. That's really cool. I love GameStop and going to the movies, and I'm glad we're not seeing more companies go under due to the virus.


We didn't do this all on our own, though. What we provided was that initial spark. Once the big guys saw what we were doing, they piled on. That's a good thing. It means they saw the same things we did, just not as early.


**We Have the World's Attention**


We dominated the world and financial news for about a week. They made jokes about us on SNL. Your grandparents know what wallstreetbets is now (a chat room, right?). The White House was monitoring the situation.


The whole world is now watching and waiting for us to decide which stock is the next big play. Even the worst DD posts now could send a stock skyrocketing because people will have severe FOMO from GME and the others.


All because we liked a stock and decided to buy it. Cool.



-----


**THE BAD**


**We Pissed People Off**

Now, we do this all the time, but it's usually limited to each other and the real world never knows about it. We pissed off short sellers, hedge funds, the media, analysts, and the SEC.


You may think, who cares? Fuck 'em. And I agree, to an extent. But together they have the power to prevent us from doing anything like this ever again.


Oh, and they all lied about us, the stock, everything. Everyone. So expect that to continue.


**People Lost Big**

I know we love our loss porn, but there were people buying-in for the first time at like $400/share. Anyone doing this was taking enormous risk, especially when a lot of us got in when the price was in the teens and averaged up to the $40s.


If this was you, you learned an expensive lesson. Don't chase.



------



**THE UGLY**


**Hivemind Got the Best of Us**


At some point, around $300/share, we should've all taken a look at where we were at and re-assessed. I'm not blaming, because I'm guilty of it, too. We downvoted ANYONE who questioned why we weren't taking profits or had legitimate concerns about numbers that were coming out.

That's a real problem. And when the information started to turn against us (eg. the S3 short interest report), we should've known it was time to get out. Even if it was false, there were enough red flags by that point. This started out as a sure thing - 140% shorted, shorts extremely underwater, losing $, etc. Once that narrative started to shift, we risked the stock price tanking.


**New DD Will be a Mess**


Seriously. Take ANY new DD with a fucking gulp of salt, because the pumpers are coming. We made millions off of GME, and there's no doubt someone is out there just salivating at the thought of pumping up a shitty company in order to profit.


Now, more than ever, it's extremely important for you to pay attention to a poster's history and really do your own research on a company. If you're not comfortable holding shares for a long time, then don't buy the stock. I personally loved GME's potential, even without a short squeeze, due to their management and vision. My plan has always been to ride the squeeze to the top, then buy back in and hold it for years. Nothing about that has changed.


Oh, and do you want to know what the next short squeeze will be? I'll tell you right now:


**NONE.**


**THERE ARE NO MORE SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITIES SO STOP FUCKING LOOKING FOR THEM.**


If you see a post about the next short squeeze, just move on. It's not happening. Period.


You think things were bad before? Just. You. Wait.


-----



**TAKEAWAYS**


The biggest takeaway for me has been how people changed their tactics when it came to GME in particular. Buying shares was key. That was the game changer.


Additionally, people with legitimate concerns with evidence to back them up should at least be heard. It's one thing to downvote a shitpost. Quite another to laugh at someone for suggesting there might be something we're all missing.


Remember when people laughed at DFV? Sometimes it's good to listen to contrary opinions.


-----

Oh, on an unrelated note: GME shares are approaching my personal re-buy price of around $50/share. This is what I believe the stock's fair value is without any potential short squeeze. With Ryan Cohen's leadership, I think this company will have a nice turnaround. I wouldn't be surprised to see it legitimately trading at around $100-$150/share in the next year or so.

Looking at the VW chart people keep floating around it's hard to tell the day to day scale but what people don't seem to notice is that VW is that after jumping up $398 the price tanked hard to $210 right before the squeeze. BUT! That was 8 straight days of losses before the squeeze happened (Oct 16th - 24th).

When the price started to rise it didn't hit its peak until another few days and it stayed there for a few days (Oct 27 - 31).

I know this isn't exactly like the VW squeeze and there are different variables at play but the timeframes still lend to my point... This shit takes time! Everyone expecting this all to happen without any ups and downs need to chill the fuck out. This is just as stressful to everyone but you beautiful bastards are holding the line!

2/5/21 03:57,"rWSB is losing direction and becoming fractured. Remember Apes: alone weak, together strong (AMC proposal) First, what do I mean by losing direction and becoming fractured. Before the whole GME explosion and influx of subscribers, there was pretty much one theme on the subreddit: make huge gains or go down trying. **When the GME proposal came up, everyone was pretty much in sync to make huge gains or go down trying.** Now the subreddit has been split by a variety of different camps:

\- The OG WSB crew

\- The fresh first time investors looking to start big

\- New lurkers/spectators checking out the show

\- Seasoned investors looking to pick up the next big stock

\- Corporate accounts/bots looking to astro turf

**You'd think that with more people, WSB would grow as a force, but the problem is so many people are split:**

\- Some people are holding/buying GME for another explosion

\- Some people are holding/buying AMC, BB, NOK, etc.

\- Some people are selling because they CAN'T or SHOULDN'T be making any more losses (totally fine)

\- Some people are selling because they just want to go back to other stocks (totally fine)

\- Some assholes are selling/buying puts and then laughing at anyone buying/holding GME, BB, etc.

**Whatever the ""right"" move is, I think it's important to remember and to let new people know that the core of the WSB has been and should continue to be: make huge gains or go down trying\***

If you made money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then congrats! But if you made money and then came here to call others idiots, then get lost

If you lost money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then I'm sorry. But if you lost money and then came here to insult people who didn't/couldn't want to buy/hold, then get lost

**Regardless of the Gamestop event, this sub has and will continue to make huge gains and huge losses. It happened last year during the pandemic. It happened two years ago with tech (AMD anyone). It WILL continue to happen. Embrace the swings and don't put others down**

As for the proposal: 

Before people, I'm not calling for people to sell GME. While I'm skeptical GME can rise to $300 again or sustain mid $60s, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong and screw the cheating hedge funds. So if you're holding/buying for those diamond hands, more power to you

**What I am suggesting is that new/returning people on the subreddit look at investing in AMC.** I think focusing on AMC is the right call because:

\- The stock is pretty cheap in comparison to GME. It's simply easier to have everyone join in a mid $7 amc stock versus a mid $60 Gamestop stock. NO APE LEFT BEHIND

\- The stock does still have significant volatility to make huge swings. Compared to Nokia for example, AMC has the potential to rise significantly in a short amount of time

\- The company itself is on the upside and people are getting optimistic that the stock could naturally reach $20 long term without the help of this subreddit (theaters opening up, vaccine rollouts, etc.). Meanwhile, rallying people to Gamestop is a tough sell when Gamestop probably won't maintain $60+ value in the long term (again, happy to be wrong here)

\- It's received a bunch of coverage. It's simply easier to get people informed compared to some random stock

\- The argument could be made that there's still value to be made off of a short squeeze

In short, **I'm proposing AMC as a stock with potential to get everyone on the same page, but any low priced stock with potential would work (as long as the subreddit is united). We have a bunch of new people and attention now. Let's not waste it by tearing each other down or splitting into various factions**

**TLDR: in bold**

Briefly: I'm holding because the short interest information that's out there is scattered all over the place and we just don't know what the ACTUAL short interest in GME and AMC are.

According to FINRA, the next short interest report is on Tuesday, Feb 9th ([https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)). That means, Tuesday we'll have a clearer image of the truth behind hedgefund claims they've exited all their positions. Everyone has been speculating that the same or other hedgefunds have been upping their short positions which means, it's possible the squeeze is still to squoze.

Honestly, their poor customer service, employee culture and compensation, and failure to adapt to a growing digital marketplace are just a few of the reasons why the company is in the position it is today. From my experience as a long time customer and former employee, I wouldn't be saddened or surprised if they went under.

That being said, I bought stock in GME and AMC everyday since the 26th and I plan on holding. Not only is there potential for thick gains, but it is a chance to stick it too the financial elite AND profit from a shitty company that didn't do right by its staff or customers.

Now a lot of the loss porn and position posts on here don't reflect the situations of the Average Joe. I, like many other hopeful retards on here *don't have* $60k to throw at a stock just because **""lol diamond hands ape togehter stronk"",**

Even with the falling prices, media hailstorm, and fear setting in; I remember something that Warren Buffet said, ***""Wall Street is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient""***. I hold because I have seen investments climb out of a trench and net me profits, but don't let anyone tell you what is the right thing to do.

**- Never invest (gamble) more than you are comfortable losing**

**- Know when to walk away from the table (take a break and come back)**

I made a trade on the phone with the fidelity broker and they told me everything was fine. Td ameritrade said there was some error and cancelled the trade. So I initiated a wire transfer to my chase to then wire it over to my fidelity but before I could do so fidelity sold my GME and AMC at the current -70% of my account. 

I called everyday this week to both brokers and they all said it‚Äôs going through great. Technically, I haven‚Äôt lost any money because my actual cash is in my chase bank but fidelityhas a negative balance and I‚Äôm considering not even putting it into fidelity now.

2/5/21 03:00,"Watch a Movie, Play a Game, Diamond Hands are here to Stay üíé üôå Do nothing and we win. Put your mouth where your money is, or better yet your actions. Watch a movie (AMC) instead of worrying about how far down you are. Play a game (GME) instead of watching the ticker all day. Do literally nothing, and we win. GameStop didn‚Äôt get to almost $500 by sheer luck. AMC didn‚Äôt get to $20+ because we were playing games. They reached these heights because we saw POTENTIAL in these stocks, we like these stocks üòé üíé üôå 

‚ÄúBut movies are only streaming now‚Äù... really? Yeah, Trolls 2 opted for streaming. Sure, Mulan opted for streaming‚Äîwhatever. But even... TENET opted for streaming, but guess what? They barely broke even in the box office. Mulan flopped. Trolls did well, but let‚Äôs face it, crying kids shouldn‚Äôt be in the theaters in the first place so playing their movies at home is actually a better idea anyway. But THEATER movies? There‚Äôs a reason why the new Bond movie has been finished since last April and delayed until post COVID. They‚Äôd rather sell 4 $20 tickets than 1 $30+ PPV. Hollywood makes most of their $$ from ticket sales, whereas theaters profit from the concessions, but you already knew that. The point is, Hollywood would NEVER let a cash flow like that go out of business and start releasing movies only at home.

Let me ask you an honest question: Anyone else heard about the Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire trio rumored for Spider-Man 3? You think Marvel would EVER release that directly to Disney plus? Have you ever been to any Marvel movie ever in lMAX / Dolby opening night? The energy is UNPRECEDENTED. 

Robert Pattinson‚Äôs Batman, new James Bond, King‚Äôs Man, Pirates of the Caribbean reboot, Ready Player 2... the list goes on. These are, for the most part, THEATER movies. Surrounded by fans and overpriced icees, buttery popcorn and your nerdy gf that loves that shit more than you do. THATS the value of a movie theater, and AMC does it best, so in my humble opinion they‚Äôre not going anywhere.

And on top of all of that, we HOLD with some shiny üíé üôå then boom... to the fucking moon baby. Simple maths, more demand = higher price.

2/5/21 02:58,"What's AMC worth? Lots of posts here lately discussing the future (or lack thereof) of AMC Entertainment Holdings.  For a quick DD, let's compare their stats pre-pandemic and today:

**Pre-pandemic:** in January 2020, AMC traded around $7/share, and had a market cap of $700M.  19Q3 revenues were $1.3B.

**Now:** in January 2021 just before the recent runup, AMC traded around $2.5/share, and had a market cap of $400M, accounting for the successive share dilutions.  20Q3 revenues were $0.12B.

Their revenues fell 90% Y/Y, they have massive debt of over $5B, they've diluted their shares, and their cash flow is horrid.  Even if they ever get revenues back to pre-pandemic levels (which may take years, and they still have to make their debt payments), ***they'd be worth only $4-5 because of the dilution***, assuming the market will pay the same multiple as pre-pandemic.

One thing that will be interesting to watch tomorrow:

GME was on the NYSE Short Sale Restricted List (SSR, no not the USSR) earlier this week. This gets automatically triggered if the stock price drops more than 10% in a day. It basically enforces the Uptick Rule, which says you can only short on an upswing.

Coincidentally, yesterday (2/3) was the only day since last Thursday that the price has gone up even slightly.

Both companies are back on it as of this evening until 2/8. This means the price may go back up tomorrow. If so, my smooth brain opinion is that the huge downswing we‚Äôve been seeing this week has been massive shorts being reopened. Maybe the NYSE short data being released on 2/9 will tell us something interesting. Only time will tell at this point.

2/5/21 14:19,"Previous post got removed so posting it again. Remember, you can write off your stock market losses as tax-deductible. This will truly be the most non-bullshit thing you will read and learn today. Save this post somewhere. This is not financial advice, I am writing this because hopefully it will benefit some of you. So you have lost a lot of money in GME or AMC or the stock of your choice over the last few days. I am sure you are feeling pretty hopeless, and trust me, I am there with you. 

But did you know that you can offset this loss by reporting it to the Internal Revenue Service and use it as a tax-deductible? Internal Revenue Service allows you to report realized capital loss up to $3000 on the taxes you file and deduct that amount from your overall taxable income. 

**What is a realized capital loss?**

Simply put, it is the loss you have sustained after selling your stocks at a price below your buying price. 

**This is great. How much money can I write off?** 

$3000. It will be deducted from your overall taxable income. 

**What if I have more than $3000 in loss?**

Internal Revenue Services allows you to carry over the remaining loss over the first $3000 over to your next year's taxable income. 

**How do I do that?**

Along with how you regularly file your taxes, you would need to fill out Form 8949 and schedule D for your tax return. 

**What if I have gained some money and lost some?**

 If you are in net gain, you will report this income to the Internal Revenue Service, and will be taxed for that. If you are in net loss, you will report this net loss to the Internal Revenue Services for the tax credit. That is, your total gain from the market-your total loss from the market. If this number is negative, you qualify for getting this deduction. 

**This link will give you a good idea about the concept:** [**https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp)

**If you are still with me:**

If you are new to stocks, believe me, this will not be your only loss in the market. Sometimes you will win big, you will lose big. Just remember to learn from both of them. Find out what you did right and keep trading and investing that way. Find out what you did wrong and avoid that in the future. No matter what people say, always remember, it is your money, and it will impact your future. Good luck!


Edit: 

There seem to be a few common questions, I will answer them here. 

What if I haven‚Äôt sold? 
 
Then this does not apply to you. It is only applicable on realized losses, I.e. the losses that you incur after selling 

Will this apply to 2020 taxes or 2021? 

2021

Is this US only? 
Yes, but I believe British tax rules also have a similar position. If anyone knows about other countries, drop a comment and I will update it here

So will I get 3000 off my taxes? 

No. It will be applied to your Taxable income. For example, if your taxable income was $50,000 and if you have incurred $3000 in loss in the stock market, your taxable income after this provision will be $47,000.

You should also know the washsale rule, which states that if you have sold and bought the same stock again in 30 days, you will not be qualified for this provision. So if you have already cut your losses, it is better to stay out now, unless you‚Äôre absolutely sure that you will make back your investment and more profit.

So I tried to understand their strategy and their move.. I'm not an expert in finance, I don't understand the specifics, I use my logics, I just try to understand whats going on, be free to correct me and put your insight, I think it's a great exercise. 

\-Early January, GME and AMC are in a very bad situation so they bet that their stock whould go down.

\-Mid-late January some Ape from reddits decide to push these stock to the moon. So Hedge funds can't close their shorts for a certain time. The more time they wait, more fee and interest they have to pay. 

\-The goal of these amazing ape is to bleed the hedge fund.

\-After  the little squeeze, the hedge funds claim that they lost billions $$$. This is where I become sceptical. What if they didnt lose that much money, how much money can they really lose in a few day for not closing shorts? We always say that we don't lose money until we sell our stock at lost, it's probably the same thing for hedge funds, no? They probably lost money, but billions seems a bit far fetch, no?  So, maybe they are trying to give us a small victory, a fake victory for the cause.

\-This week, a lot of stock have lost momentum, their goal is to close their shorts fast. They want to close for 2 reasons, they are losing money and on the 9th of february there's a report they will tell, that they didnt close their shorts.  If that report says that the hedge fund didnt close their shorts, it's very probable it will trigger another squeeze.  

\-Hedge funds have 2 advantages over us: they have knowledge of their true position and they can buy/sell during after hour.

\-So if I was the Hedge funds, this week Iwould use every dirty trick I know to crash the stock, short ladder, media manipulation, etc. During the weekend or monday, I close most of my shorts and right before the report is release, they buy a tons of stock of GME and AMC. Not only they can close their shorts at like 6$ instead of 18$ for AMC, but they can make money from the squeeze. With that strategy they could break even and maybe even make a bit of money! ?

Complaints about the above can be broken down to this:

1) Cramer and the rest of the news media are in the business of getting eyeballs. Not helping people invest or make money. GME/AMC/whatever else was the hot story so they ran it. Their ‚Äúadvice‚Äù is a facade. 

2) Robinhood shut down trading in GME and other meme stocks because it became a victim of its own success. They didnt have enough cash to support your trades so they stopped trading. You trusted a startup to handle your investing and you paid the price. Honestly I think you should be grateful they didnt let you buy more at $300/sh. But I realize im arguing with retards here.

3) The SEC is looking into WSB because they think that hedge funds supported and profited off the GME hype. They dont care about your five shares and üíéüôåüèº memes. Honestly just take one minute and look at the stock chart, are you really surprised the SEC is investigating who might have manipulated the stock UP rather than back down to earth. Get a grip on reality.

4) Short ladders aren‚Äôt real and even if they were, they‚Äôd only work if there isn‚Äôt real investor demand for the stock. And we all know there isnt an iota of real demand at >$50. If the stock was actually worth $1,000 then it would trade at $1,000.

Just like how a short squeeze doesn‚Äôt last forever, neither would a ladder. Its clear now which side is ‚Äúright.‚Äù

If you lost money on GME its because you got sucked into the hype or got greedy. Perhaps you took a virtuous route and saw a community that tried to take down a bunch of hedge funds.

I saw people or all races, ethnicities, orientations, and political & social views come together. It was an American thing in the start but when it seemed the shorters were winning I saw people from Austria, Germany, Canada, Korea Japan, New Zeland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and more not only give words of support but their money to keep things going.

I saw good things happen, I saw a 15 year old kid take his 3k and make 250k and pull his profit to pay for college. I saw a 10 year old kid get rich from a gift his mom gave him years ago. I saw a man find out his dog needed life saving surgery and because of his profit he could do it. I saw a guy donate nintindo switches (a lot of them) to St Judes. I saw someone buy tendie lunches for all the workers at Gillette childrens healthcare.  I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I saw so many reports of good things! People helping people with their winnings.

Was it worth it even if I never recoup my money? Hell yes! It's great to see so many people come together despite their differences. To see so many good things come out of it. Were there greedy people involved, sure. Were there some who stepped on others, sure. Happens everywhere, but it's not always balanced with the good. It's nice to be reminded of the good.

2/5/21 23:41,"15 Facts About the Diamond [Hands] First of all, obligatory üíéüëêüöÄ. 
Second of all, I am one of the ""little guys"" in on GME at $260 and AMC at $13. Holding with my measly -$1000ish loss. 

Now that I got that out of the way, let's learn about diamonds, shall we?

These 15 facts about diamonds was pulled from [here](https://www.brilliantearth.com/news/15-amazing-facts-about-diamonds/).  I'd like to just post this as a very ""I come in peace"" post. Yes, I am biased towards those of us holding out prices. I also feel very proud that we helped pull AMC out of bankruptcy.

Anyways.

1

The ancient Romans and Greeks believed that diamonds were tears cried by the gods or splinters from falling stars, and Romans believed that Cupid‚Äôs arrows were tipped with diamonds (perhaps the earliest association between diamonds and romantic love).

We can imagine these tears of the hedge funds that were trying to create 20% more stock than is available, to then make a profit off of. Some (seeming) ""gods"" are mortal too.

2

Diamonds are billions of years old‚Äîin some cases more than three billion years old.

How about 3.73B? The same as the market cap for $GME... Interesting.

3

Diamonds form about 100 miles below ground and have been carried to the earth‚Äôs surface by deep volcanic eruptions.

Months ago, something surfaced from the extreme deep. u/deepfuckingvalue that is.  This volcano is about to erupt.

4

Diamonds are made of a single element‚Äîthey‚Äôre nearly 100% carbon. Under the immense heat and pressure far below the earth‚Äôs surface, the carbon atoms bond in a unique way that results in diamonds‚Äô beautiful and rare crystalline structure.

The farther down this goes, the more pressure is being exerted, both on us, the holders and on the ones who have outrageous shorts. Your carbon hands will either burn up like paper or solidify and harden into beautiful diamonds.

5

The word diamond derives from the Greek word ‚Äúadamas,‚Äù which means invincible or indestructible. Which makes sense because‚Ä¶

Together: adamas, divided we fall.

6

Diamonds are the very hardest natural substance. The only thing that can scratch a diamond is another diamond.

No high fives please.

7

Diamonds have been valued and coveted for thousands of years. There is evidence that diamonds were being collected and traded in India as early as the fourth century BC. In the first century AD, the Roman naturalist Pliny is quoted as having said, ‚ÄúDiamond is the most valuable, not only of precious stones, but of all things in this world.‚Äù

Those of us still holding, being formed by pressure. We are precious and we hold the value.

8

Ancient Hindus used diamonds in the eyes of devotional statues, and believed that a diamond could protect its wearer from danger.

Holding leads to pressure, pressure leads to diamonds, diamonds lead to protection. More diamonds, more protection. 

9

Many ancient cultures believed that diamonds gave the wearer strength and courage during battle, and some kings wore diamonds on their armor as they rode into battle.

This is the highest medal one can give themselves. The üíé is a self-appointed badge of honor here.

10

During the Middle Ages diamonds were thought to have healing properties able to cure ailments ranging from fatigue to mental illness.

I don't think it's working on the mental illness front. And I believe most of us are fatigued, so as we all knew, the middle ages we're full of shit. (And trebuchets)

11

The countries that are the main sources of diamonds have changed over time. India was the world‚Äôs original source of diamonds, beginning in the 1400s when Indian diamonds began to be sold in Venice and other European trade centers. Then in the 1700s India‚Äôs diamond supplies declined and Brazil became the world‚Äôs major source of diamonds, until the late 1800s when a huge diamond reserve was discovered in South Africa.¬† Today, diamonds are mined in many parts of the world. Brilliant Earth goes above and beyond the current industry standards to offer¬†Beyond Conflict Free Diamonds‚Ñ¢¬†with a listed origin of Canada, Botswana Sort, or Russia.

Hands all over the world are now in this diamond trade with us. Just look at the posts a few days ago. Plenty of countries trying to make this movement work.

12

The largest diamond ever discovered was called the¬†Cullinan¬†diamond, and weighed in at an amazing 3106 carats, or 1.33 pounds. Discovered in 1905 in South Africa, the mine‚Äôs owner and the South African leaders gave the diamond to King Edward. The Cullinan was eventually cut into 9 large diamonds and 100 smaller ones, and the three largest of these are on display in the Tower of London as part of the crown jewels.

I'm not sure who has the largest overall loss right now, but I'm sure we can have a top 10 losses list somewhere at this point. (Loss from origin, not height).  Whomever holds that right now is definitely the largest diamond here.

13

The first known use of a¬†diamond engagement ring¬†took place in 1477, when Archduke Maxmillian of Austria gave Mary of Burgundy a gold ring featuring an M spelled out in diamonds.

When shit takes off, I will buy my wife's boyfriend a ring to ask her to marry him. 

14

Lab diamonds have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as mined diamonds. They¬†are sustainable diamonds that have minimal environmental impact. Discover Brilliant Earth‚Äôs collection of¬†lab diamonds.

All of our diamonds are the same. No matter the cost of production.

15

The most mind-blowing diamond facts of all: Scientists have discovered a planet that they believe is composed mostly of carbon, and is one-third pure diamond!¬† Discovered in 2004, the planet orbits a nearby star in the Milky Way, and is named ‚Äú55 Cancri e‚Äù (which, in our opinion, is not a sufficiently glamorous name for such an extraordinary planet). Perhaps even more amazing, scientists have discovered a star that is essentially a diamond of ten billion trillion trillion carats.¬† They named the star Lucy after the Beatles song ‚ÄúLucy in the Sky with Diamonds.‚Äù (We approve.)
While diamonds have clearly created a lot of joy for people throughout history, they have too often resulted in suffering in the communities where they‚Äôre mined. At Brilliant Earth we believe diamonds shine brighter when they‚Äôre sourced in an ethical, environmentally friendly way.¬†Learn more¬†about the issues surrounding diamond mining, and what we‚Äôre doing to bring about change.

We're all on this rocket. It's still primed. Fuck the moon, to Lucy we go! 

There may be a lot of suffering. But as many here say, do not put your life's saving into this.

My two pieces of advice, If you can _bull_ with me;
1. only use money that you're willing to throw in a literal trash can. If you can do that and feel ok with it, then by all means, throw it away.  _MAYBE_ the trash collector will knock on your door and give you back your money as well as all the other money they found in the trash.

2.  NEVER. LOOK. BACK.

2/5/21 23:37,"My thoughts on AMC Think about the competition of AMC: -Netflix, Amazon, Hulu etc. Online streaming services are the most threatening competitors of the cinema industry... But the thing we need to focus on is the delivery of the product (the shows). The range of content on online streaming services is far wider, however, they are increasingly tending towards in house productions. Online streaming services have their content catalogues diversified and increasingly produced in-house. This way, they own the rights to the media and can stream it without paying enormous leasing fees. That's why Netflix keeps taking Friends off of their service, because another online service outbids them for the rights to the lease of that media. For this reason, and trust me on this I have studied this for a while, online streaming services will continue to vigorously upscale in-house media production (Netflix originals, prime originals etc) to lower operating fees. 

Netflix has a ridiculous amount of long term debt (not necessarily bad, but important to consider) from fees to lease the rights to TV shows/movies. 

**NOW**. **HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO AMC?**

AMC will host the showing of big movies, like the Avengers etc. Movies that will ONLY be in cinemas and NOT on Netflix. They have priority in massive budget movies which means that they will always have a source of customers, as long as the media industry continues to produce blockbuster movies. 

AS SUCH: AMC can capitalize and sell merchandise, sell a show, an experience, and make money from many other sources instead of just the product (the media) itself (UNLIKE Netflix). That's why, in the long term, assuming the management of AMC doesn't completely go retard mode and COVID does actually go away one day, there will be a large customer base for the business.

That's too bad but its not over. The classic saying ""you only lose if you sell"" is 100% correct here.

First off, I'm not advocating to hold for the squeeze as at this point, who know if it will ever be squoze. Until the report comes out next week, its guess work at this point and will only be an educated guess as they'll be old figures when they are released.

I'm holding and I'll be buying more (averaging down) for a longer term investment.

GME 15 @ $240
AMC 40 @ $13

So, what do we know is true?

There's a report coming that will release figures of shorts potentially covered next week.

Everyone's reporting ""Game over for GME"". Why would that be reported if it were over?

GME have hired Amazon Execs to up its E commerce.

The people have backed GME and AMC. This is massive, you can buy reputational advertising for the billions the hedge funds lost and people will want a piece of the action once this is over. It only increases how viable it is for investment long term.

There memes for this whole escapade were worth the giant red figure thats keeping eye contact with while it takes a massive wank all over my profits.


So please don't be defeatist. It's demoralising seeing a big red in the account but everyone can come back from this.

Grab your bootstraps and average down as much as you can and maybe it will pop, if not, it's looking more and more a viable investment after all this exposure,  so average down keep! And keep investing over the next year and earn those long term tendies!!

Hold, buy more on the dips and see what happens!

2/5/21 21:51,"Watching today, a road map for next week. (Possibly) As of now the AMC shares are about $7.33 when im typing this. For days Wall Street has been houding us, battering us with attacks from the markets and the dogs mouth of the media. We stood firm, not selling and still buying AMC shares when they ""Bought and Sold"" within seconds of them doing so to lower the price. I've never seen such a hive of scum and villainy in all the universe before I saw what Wall ST. could really do. 

As of last night AMC went on the SSR (Short Sale Restriction) list, or funnily enough SEC Rule 201. I can't explain it properly so go to this link here for more info -> https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2019/05/20/ssr-what-it-is-and-what-you-need-to-know/ 
What I can gather is that because AMC dropped to such a low price,  people now can't short it like they've been doing all this week. So this is a big bonus for us. The second bonus is that a lot of American citizens, apes and tendie thrashers have been paid last night, so people will be buying en masse to grt on this train. Third bonus, AMC Theatres are to open from this weekend across America, so if you can go out and enjoy a film to ENJOY THE STOCK.

For reasons I do not understand why it trades this way. Both are meme stocks and are among the most popular stocks on WSB but those reasons alone shouldn't be enough to morph into this.  Hy who two stocks in different sectors, prices point,  news, trade nearly identical to each other?  I notice when a large infusion on one stock was posted, both would benefit. Would like to hear a different perspective on this matter.

I‚Äôm new to trading, new to stocks, but I realized that I had an opportunity to get myself out of a financial hole in cold and uncertain times without the ability of working a regular job. So I found this sub, and I instantly was thankful to be around like minded individuals where I can learn more about stocks and study people‚Äôs DD somewhere outside of just YouTube. 


Seeing the sub go downhill and making a complete 180¬∞ turn from optimism into chaos and corruption injected a lot of anger and stress into me and a lot of others in the hopes of panic selling. If Robinhood never restricted GME and AMC, those stocks would‚Äôve never bombed, but even with those restrictions everyone was still wearing their losses as a badge of honor and buying billboards, supporting these stocks unconditionally. 


February 3rd comes along and there‚Äôs dozens if not hundreds of bots spreading fear and negativity and encouraging traders to panic sell. The most trusted and most active mods get booted, auto mod gets removed and the whole thing turns into a shit show (and not in a good poop flinging at each other way). The worst part to me is that I know some people actually got convinced into panic selling at a big loss, and I can‚Äôt imagine how devastating that must be some people during a pandemic. Knowing how things were going the day before, people would‚Äôve have been as terrified as they were before the turmoil the bots and MSM caused within this sub. We were motivating each other. We were all memes and emojis and happy to share our loss porn, the community bond was some real shit. Motherfuckers tried to ruin that and scare newcomers into not buying even at such a discount, and scaring others to sell at catastrophic losses (sus as fuck).


Seeing sellouts being called out and seeing loss porn and camaraderie again in this sub fills me with joy. Sure there are still bots and hacked accounts trying to convince others that $GME is dead or whatever, but almost everyone now knows FOR SURE that it is all fake and an infiltration being used as an intimidation tactic. I‚Äôm so happy to be back in WSB again. I‚Äôm so happy that people aren‚Äôt being shamed and bombarded with negativity for holding anymore.

I know some of you weirdos out there certainly believe in this shit, but we're going to get our tin-foil hats on here.

Drastic times call for drastic measures.

We'll need a few things:

- Candles
- 3 Chickens
- Natenberg's Option Volatility & Pricing
- Powerball/Mega Millions tickets (optional)

We're going to talk about chicken sacrifices to the market gawds in dedication to Papa Jerome Powell (peace be upon him) and hope some of this QE flows your way.

I read once in a great investing book, this is what the glowies at rival hedge funds do to generate phaat (yes with ph) gainz.
 
First, we need a copy of our options trading bible, yes natenberg - ah you've never heard of it? that's why you might find yourself in this position old sport!

Second, we need some candles for ambience. Can't make money if your vibe isn't right. Ok. 

Third, now this isn't where its very clear - but this is my takeaway - I've read that for every 2 chickens, you can exchange your newly minted paper bag for 25% refund. With a 3rd, we unlock a tier which has only been seen by a few.

Fourth we have to chant ""GME AMC APE TOGETHER DUMB, SPCE AMD BETTER TRADES, x100.

Instead the media and hedge funds taking WSB investors for dead. It would be a good strategy to make a very public statement that WSB is here to stay. The top two stocks that the media connects WSB with is GME and AMC. While it would be awesome it where GME, its just too expensive. 

Any investor who has the ability and wants to believe that WSB can be a hedge fund for the masses the best way to do so is by converting GME stock to AMC. Right now roughly 1 GME = 5 AMC stocks. Anybody who would follow this strategy that owns GME would increase their leverage 5X against the AMC shorts. This strategy is not just about those that own GME if there are autists who don't own GME they would still benefit buying the stock as it is cheaper than pre pandemic levels. The timing of this strategy is good. This is at the end of the week which means that whoever is managing their shorts are going to rebalance for the next week. (research pending) This is a perfect time to force the short squeeze.

2/6/21 03:21,"GameStonk Thesis üöÄüöÄüåô ‚ÄúüíéüôåüèΩ GameStonk‚Äù Thesis:

¬†¬†¬†¬†1.¬†¬†¬†¬†The surge in GameStop pricing was from supply and demand from the sudden viral spread

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-we did not see the sustained and prolonged volume we would need if the shorts were to cover their position, just retail jumping into the hype

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-there is even some evidence (the number of failure to delivers in the data the last several months) to suggest that the surge in pricing was partially hedge funds covering illegal ‚ÄúNaked Shorts‚Äù and having to hop into the buying frenzy to cover their ass now that the rest of the situation is being more closely monitored by authorities and that‚Äôs a large enough infraction to actually get in trouble but hard to prove if you cover it in time. 

¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†¬†Hedges set a second round of shorts at higher prices

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-rhe placing of GME on SHO (a watchlist) and NYSE restricting further shorts indicates this

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-this could be an accounting trick to lower there average loss point later, not just out of arrogantly thinking they will discourage people, but it could be realistically be either

¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†¬†Thursday/Friday we saw a massive amount of Capital being removed from the broader stock market

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-this could have been drawn out by Hedge Funds to pay for cyber disruption campaigns, take care of borrow fees on the outstanding shorts, and fund sustained ‚Äòshort ladder attacks‚Äô (things we see happening that artificially push down the price), and eventually to help cover the shorts

¬†¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†¬†The % shortage of the total stock went down due to market manipulation

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-‚ÄòSynthetic longs‚Äô are in essence a fake stock that only exists on the balance sheets, which can be used to give the appearance on financial records of having covered your short position for a fraction of the cash it takes to actually do so, and can be used to spoof SEC data with relatively minor consequences

¬†¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†¬†There has been a massive cyber disruption campaign

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-400k deepfakes+as many as 10% additional bots, and a hostile takeover of the Subreddit WallstreetBets

¬†¬†¬†¬†6.¬†¬†¬†¬†There has been sustained, coordinated low volume attacks to drive down prices

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-AMC and GME stock is directly correlated (an overlayed picture is almost identical)since the supply and demand rocket began last week, indicated coordinated price suppression 

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-Despite this sustained downward pressure, now that retail investors are unrestricted in buying again it seems like redditors with higher psychological buy in and risk tolerance are instead buying more shares and holding the rest with prices holding much steadier even as volume has increased directly coinciding with the reintroduction of Retail investors to the market

¬†¬†¬†¬†7.¬†¬†¬†¬†At prices under 100 a share, we LIKE THIS STOCK given the underlying fundamentalist term prospects of the company; /u/DeepFuckingValue‚Äôs in depth analysis explaining that position was what started the meme and how they stumbled into realizing the whole ‚Äúthe stock is over 100% shorted‚Äù situation

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-Lowering our avg price point to as low as possible beneath that means even if we assume that there is no big squeeze coming and this is just prolonged volatility, we can sell at that price in 6 mo-1 yr to recoup investment which makes continued investment under 100 a logical way to hedge our bets. 

¬†¬†¬†¬†8.¬†¬†¬†¬†Even though this is the stock market, behavior economics reminds us that group psychology and the psychology of mass movements is applicable

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-The initial highbrow analysis and memeification spread like wildfire, instilling near cult like influence, while Redditors (used to fighting bot driven influence campaigns) respond with extra intensity if they view their platform as under attack. 

¬†¬†¬†¬†9.¬†¬†¬†¬†In 2008 this situation was precedented with VW stocks on the Frankfurt exchange; the main difference is it was organized Hedge Funds involved

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-without anywhere near the capital raised just to spend manipulating the market or as much to lose on the line, 6 trading days of around -50% decline bc of short ladders were still paid for before the shorts were called in

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-the data from VW in 08 also extrapolates over to this scenario as a 28K as max price and 10 K as safe exit point

¬†¬†¬†¬†10.¬†¬†¬†¬†I would bet more that I‚Äôm right and Wall Street is corrupt and convincing/tricking corporate media into pushing a narrative that benefits them while spreading disinformation online that that hundreds of thousands of people ways better that at this than me (including M. Cuban, Elon Musk,) are wrong; especially when being right means changing my life and my community and being wrong means learning a funny lesson about group think and economic populism. 

Bonus factor that could contribute to a the start of a squeeze: 

Ryan Cohen (the Chewy.com guy who bought 7% of the company and is part of turning it around; the ongoing push to modernize, his presence and a few good recent hires are why we‚Äôre long at the stock at 100) has the rights to buy an additional 13% putting his total at 20%.

GME and AMC have been doing shit for the past few days. I haven't lit my candle in the past few days because I forgot to. I noticed this, so I lit it up this morning at about 8:45, but blew it out at 10 when I went to the gym. The stocks spiked this morning up until I left for the gym. 

I'm home now, and the candle is once again lit. If the stocks reach higher highs than normal today, I will go out and buy an assload of these candles.

2/6/21 02:06,"People who got left holding the bag with GME should sell and buy AMC While I agree and believe GME shares are not worth more than $20 a share. GME had the fuel to reach $1000-10,000 a share because of the fundamentals of shorting. No sharers available to cover, Thus it was possible to sell your shares at orbital prices. 

Now that WALL STREET was able to play dirty and take the fuel out of GME, I NO LONGER believe GME will reach those prices anymore. NOW the share price will behave like any other normal stock. As GME offers new services and a new business model, then the share price will rise proportionally to the value the company offers. THEREFORE, all those who bought $50-400 a share should sell or recover losses. I SUGGEST selling and jumping onto AMC

I believe AMC will not experience that üöÄüåï because is not as shorted as GME was. However, the average price as the country opens up should be $15-20 this year specially w vaccines being more effective, allowing you to recover from GME losses. 

Also gives me confidence Blackrock double their ownership on AMC from 3 to 6%. I believe the current price of AMC is a bargain to double your money at this prices. 

As sad as it makes me say it the Short squeeze is over and is GAME OVER for GameStop thanks to WALL STREET MANIPULATION!

LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Hedge funds with bearish positions on GameStop, the video game retailer at the centre of the recent retail trading frenzy, made $3.6 billion in profits this week as the share price dropped sharply, financial analytics firm Ortex said on Friday.

That comes after short positions on GameStop suffered cumulative losses of $12.5 billion over January as a horde of small-time investors piled into the stock, inflating its price as much as 2,400% and forcing many hedge funds to buy them back to cover losses.

But the short squeeze has since ebbed, pushing GameStop shares 90% below last week's peak of $483.

Ortex data also showed hedge funds' profits from shorting AMC , another company targeted by retail investors, amounted to $430 million this week as of Thursday close.

In Europe, short sellers of Nokia stock made $126 million, the data showed.

This isn't a post about numbers and patterns and trades as such. In my opinion, when you're up against a behemoth like major hedgefunds, it's essential that we don't all stray and move apart like lost lambs. Our strength here comes from more than just the size of your portfolio, it's supposed to be a community. 

The last 2 weeks, this place has been toxic. We've slated one another (I'm as guilty as the next man) been unsupportive of those who came out unscathed from these incredibly volitile movement's in the market, and just generally been dickheads to one another. 

This goes against where our strengths are. It's counter productive. 

We need to step up and instead of acting like  bunch of individuals, start acting as a single entity again. 

People have been attracted to these shares because of the obvious strength we have in numbers but everytime we shit on somebody when they share a different opinion to us, it brings us all down. If we can't have anything somewhat decent to say, just be civil back. 

We spread by word of mouth, people invest because their friends invested because one person found the shares on WSB of Interest. Right now, we're apes just throwing shit at each other and it's starting to show. 

I invested in AMC, friends invested in GME. Others invested elsewhere. We're already spread thinner than we should be. Can we just be something a little bit more than self riotous cunts for a week to see where this can actually go. 

We've been told countless times that holding is key. But for those of us holding, you don't have to a dick when someone decides to get out.

2/6/21 07:04,"SIX HEDGE FUNDS AND NINE BROKERS ADDED TO ROBINHOOD CLASS ACTION 
The various brokers and hedge funds allegedly conspired together to knowingly deprive retail investors of the ability to invest in the open market during an unprecedented stock rise, in order to benefit the hedge fund companies, such as Citadel, Melvin Capital, and Maple Lane Capital. The lawsuit alleges that the online brokers involved froze the everyday investors out to enable the hedge funds to stop losing money when the stocks rose in value.

The lawsuit continues to allege that Robinhood and nine other online brokers failed to provide duty of care to their customers and that they purposefully harmed their customers positions in GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) and twelve other stocks, such as Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC), Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK), K055 Corporation (NYSE: redacted), and nak3d Brand Group Ltd (NYSE: redacted). The lawsuit is also alleging that Robinhood was recently fined $1.5M by the SEC, and a monitor has been assigned to watch their activities closely.

This class action is the first and only one to include all six hedge funds, all ten brokers, and all thirteen stocks.

The case is 3:21-cv-00167, Nordeen et al v. Robinhood Financial LLC et al.

The plaintiffs are represented by the Law Offices of Gary R Carlin APC, a Long Beach based law firm.

So.... I just sunk everything into this stock. HOw MucH? you ask?!  enough. plenty. 

yesterday was a hard day. for everyone. for people holding GME / AMC but also for people not holding GME... if they had a heart. no, the hedgies didn't lose. the middle class who believed in ü§ôüíé  did. some, lost big.  and everyone who isn't a sociopath shared the pain when we heard the stories of the losses. 

but we can't forget. the comedy united us. and THIS GROUP squeezed that stock and had the time of their lives doing it. and we don't want to lose that momentum now, do we? and to the people holding GME still, who bought at the top. I'm sorry ü•∫ but you already took that ride down, so you already are holding the bag. the stock may have an unprecedented second fomo bull run, but many scholars would say thats improbable. and there's most likely more deflating to do with GmE/amc because of the extreme volitility it just experienced upward.

2/6/21 06:57,"GME, BB, AMC, NOK Your one pager of dipshit dumbassness: i love these stocks. This is not advice. 

They lifted restrictions and look what happened. Amazing how fickle minded people are. Loved the abuse yesterday but only because I‚Äôm into that shit. 

WHAT DID WE LEARN? 
We‚Äôre playing mass market psychology now. Panic induces selling-something autists and wall st has known for years. Knee jerk reaction to stop the bleeding. 

Mark cuban basically explained to the world how non dividend paying stocks are basically Pok√©mon cards. The loudest mid on the playground screams about his charizard and its worth what WE think it is. 

Fundamentals like DCF, EPS, were all an excuse to drive up price and make commissions. All supporting speculation. 

Zachs and moody‚Äôs and everyone else with buy, sell ratings helped to back that, but chamath even said, you dont know what GME‚Äôs worth. You dont know what TSLA is worth. 

GME could pull a Tesla. 
What happened with Tesla? Nobody could explain it but here‚Äôs my theory: retail liked the stock. Some really loud kids yelled that TSLA was a shiny holographic charizard. No fundamentals and in a debt crisis. Retail Doesn‚Äôt care about that tho. They know who Elon is. They know he‚Äôs smart. They think Tesla is worth a lot. Cool. So it went to $1000. And they did a 5:1 split so every share was worth 200 and then people who didn‚Äôt get it were like damn Tesla‚Äôs  cheap again! Fear campaign didn‚Äôt work because retail had conviction they were right and enough people felt like they were smarter than newscasters and it was fake news to help shorts. Or they didn‚Äôt even watch news. THEY REALLY LIKED TSLA.
It went back to $800. 
Every fundamentalist is afraid to touch it. Shorts got burned and nobody‚Äôs talking about it because they don‚Äôt wanna admit they have no clue how to value that one. It proved Cubans point for non dividend paying shares being no different than a Michael Jordan rookie card. 

The only reliable thing now is momentum and mass psychology. THERES NO REASON GME CANT PULL A TSLA. 

Cohen smart too. 

If they allow freedom in market retail has power. 

Rh proved that today. 

GME to 1000, 5:1 split. And back to $800. That‚Äôs the one scenario in which we stop thanos. 

BB follows, not because short interest but because tech is good & bullish. Not a phone company anymore. Software! BB also moon

AMC - shorted to deathly bankruptcy but now has so much cash they will survive covid. Can afford a thinktank to pivot into modern trends. They wont pull a blockbuster who served as a cautionary tale of hubris. Could have bought Netflix for 17MM but got greedy. 

Last but not least,
NOK- elon is definitely up to something here. Idk but he seems like the kind of person with a back up plan to a back up plan. Dude loves the internet. Is epic shitlord troll (literally released models: S3XY). And he‚Äôs gotta be motivated by revenge for getting jumped on and almost having to take TSLA private. 
Tinfoil hats: Tesla could acquire NOK. 

What happens if you are short NOK and it gets acquired? Short HAVE to cover. Force an expiration date. Tsla buys NOK for cheap. Elon get to middle finger shorts and the SEC. TSLA led my smart genius could use Nokia‚Äôs already established 5g ready infrastructure in their cars. Not only can they honk their horn to move bitch get out the way! But also with nokias infrastructure you will be able to yell at the idiot that just cut you off through their speakers. Yeeeeeew. 

If apes keep eating crayons and buying and holding tomorrow, a simple retracement could turn into a TSLA. Crazy gains and price action on Friday will blast over the weekend and monday, we have momentum. Psychology proves everybody is going to chase it.

But I see nefarious intentions behind a lot of what we read. Manipulation, and i cannot stress this enough, but TRUE manipulation doesnt and cant come from one source (there are exceptions). On this level you must infiltrate the source of the opposing side as well as controlling your own. We (WSB, reddit) are an open forum. Anyone can post. You think people have been attempting to convince the majority of WSB to buy x, or y only recently? You're wrong. It's not only the accounts that have 1, 2 or 3 days of existence.

2/6/21 05:48,"Why I bought in on AMC and why I'm going to HOLD Here's why after watching all this going on the past week I decided two only do two things.

1. bought 1 put option on GME (all I could afford) when it was at $320. I was late to the party to ride it up, so I rode it down. Sue me.
2. Bought 300 shares AMC at $7.50 and I'm going to hold. After watching it play up and down and not hitting that mark I misjudged and thought that would be the floor. We can see it went a bit lower. That's OK, I grabbed this intending to hold it, not expecting any instant return. I can live with a little red for now.

Why buy and hold AMC? I personally go to the movies 2-3 times a week. I go to AMC only. I started going the day they reopened theaters ( I saw Back to the Future that day). It has been dead, Dead, DEAD from then until Christmas. I usually was the only person in the theater with a private showing. Even on Fridays. That's not the case anymore. In my area restrictions are the same as they were before but now I never have a theater to myself. Even old reruns have 3-4 people. I'm seeing couples and people bringing their kids again. Even on midweek days. Sure, they only have one or two showings per film per day, but that's all going to change as the demand grows. and is already has been.

People want to go out again, and are already, and we are still in the deepest part of the pandemic. As we get the population vaccinated there will be less and less holding anyone back. Two years of big titles are ready to release and coming. AMC is going to dominate the marketplace. I wouldn't be surprised to see a merger or them possibly making a deal to acquire Cinemark (which actually I don't want to see, because I'm sure that would make holding AMC an even longer play). They already just shed 600M in debt. That's a huge boon to their bottom line. Come summer they will be profitable. In Fall they will kill it.

Just a recap for those who don't remember. The stock was trading at $3 when movies were literally playing to empty auditoriums, and they were about to declare bankruptcy. Now they made over HALF A BILLION of debt vanish, bankruptcy is completely off the table, movie goers are significantly up and rising, and we are rounding the corner on the pandemic. All that changed for them, and you're telling me that makes them only worth $3.50 more? ""Well, they are still losing money right now!"" OK, you're right. You think they won't ever make money again? Not even with emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position than they were before? As soon as they report a profit on quarterly earnings, that's when you'll see the price rocket. ""But, the business model is failing, it's all about streaming now!"" Yea, and when Jeff Bezos started selling printed books online they said he was nuts because it was all supposed to be about e-books on tablets. Now he's the richest man on the planet. Turns out people liked buying old fashioned books so much that he was able to use his platform to start selling them everything. He never would have gotten there if nobody wanted books like they said. The more complex the world gets, the more people like the simple pleasures they are used to. Movies aren't dead.

Nine months from now people without the balls to buy at the low and hold will look back and kick themselves when the price closes up 400% from now.

During the last couple of days I felt down, I lashed out and overreacted over little things. Also I was glued to the stock price constantly.

I'm angry the hedge funds covered their shorts the way they did (market manipulation, restrictions,  etc.). I was hoping for a change today when the restrictions were lifted, and hoped for a big uptick with all of your enthusiasm, but GME is up only by a tiny amount compared to the movements during the last couple of days and AMC is down.

Therefore, I finally made the decision to sell. I'm sorry everyone, but for me this wasn't worth it anymore. I have to prioritize my mental health and my friends/family.

I wanted to hold; not for a potential future profit, but for the principle. Also for all of you. I'm sorry to disappoint. If the stock goes up again, I'll be happy for you and I'll probably regret selling for a second, but this is still the right decision for me.

During my time researching primarily via YouTube videos and research articles on SA I came to know a number of figures in the precious metals community.  These individuals work very hard and put in a lot of thankless hours despite the precious metals markets being among the most manipulated in the world. There was a lot of buzz last week in that community because of the garbage misdirect tactics run by CNBC, which made me feel bad.

It isn't your turn yet, we're kinda busy holding down some hedge funds at the moment but know that there are plenty of folks that haven't forgotten about you.  Artificially suppressing the price of commodities is a crime and if the rumors are true it deserves much more investigation and penalty than the pathetic fines collected thus far.

2/6/21 04:46,"Containership Rate Boom Continues: ATCO & CMRE **Atlas Corp (ATCO) & Costamare (CMRE) & Peers**

I shared my views on containership stocks earlier this week with a [note on these stocks here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l9unrf/containership_boom_ongoing/), but news is quickly improving even further, so it merits yet another update. Since last Friday, the top 3 picks in the container sector have moved up by a range of 24% to 32% (Danaos Corp, Navios Maritime Partners, Navios Containers). I listed the three largest cap names in the title since those are all over $1B and apparently anything under $1B = pump and dump. But AMC apparently wasn't?! Okay guys...

As I noted last week, rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40‚Äô boxes you see on railroads and trucks) have been going ballistic the past 4-5 months, but some of the stocks have stalled out and still trade at remarkably cheap valuations. For instance Navios Containers trades in the neighborhood of 2x my expectations for their 2021 earnings.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

The latest Harpex rates are posted each Friday morning. The new update that came out about 2 hours ago has them up another 13.2% for the midsize Panamax segment. This is a daily rate of $30,000 for the ships that hold 4,250 TEU (i.e. the ship can carry 4,250 20-foot boxes or a little more than 2,000 40-foot boxes). Remember the trains? Those are usually 40' on top of another 40' per each car.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently long about every name possible in the sector. The names remain cheap. However, obviously if stocks keep surging, I will take profits in a responsible manner on the way up. ""Dia hands"" is a funny/cute meme, but it's really quite dumb for investors. Do your own due diligence, figure out what you believe something is worth, and don't get greedy!

The 13%+ increase in mid-sized container rates exemplifies the strength for a firm like Navios Containers (which owns 25 of these 'Panamax' ships!), but we should also look at Danaos Corp, which just announced a [comprehensive refinancing](https://www.danaos.com/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Danaos-Corporation-Announces-Pricing-of-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx) for the whole company.

This is a massive turnaround from a company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy just a year ago. After the refinancing Danaos has a very streamlined balance sheet with no major maturities until 2028. Don't just take my view of it! Randy Giveans, analyst at Jefferies, and someone I can personally vouch for as a competent analyst with strong integrity, ***just upgraded them to $40.00/sh***. I think he might even be too conservative on them...

I believe we're potentially just in the 4th or 5th inning of this run.

**Bottom Line:** Bullish on containership names, really the entire sector. Sticking to names with market caps over $1B for the rules here- Atlas Corp (ATCO) and Costamare (CMRE).

**Common Pushback:**

1. Aren't these rates just in a massive bubble and will crash soon:

The rates appear to be quite strong compared to the past 10 years, but if you look at a 20-year average and the strength of the 2000s, you'll see they aren't that far out of line. The past decade, and 2013-2018 in particular, was a horrible time for container ships. These are cyclical stocks sort of like automakers or airlines or mining. Furthermore, the rates we quote and discuss are rates for 1-year and oftentimes 2-3 year deals are being signed at similar levels of strength. These aren't just 1-2 month type 'spot' rates.

2) Is this like ""tankers"" I got burned there and I believe shipping sucks:

Tankers were earning literal all-time record highs last Spring, but these were just for 30-80 day voyages. Unlike containers, the rates were record highs, no prior precedent for long-term duration. Also, unlike containers, the duration was 30-80 days, not 1-3 years. Finally, unlike containers, the tanker rates were driven by a very short-term arbitrage due to collapsing oil prices. Containers were already strong in late-2019 on a major cyclical upswing before temporarily being interrupted by COVID.

3) Isn't all this rate strength only due to COVID-19 and will go away soon:

Containerships were already in a massive upturn during 2019 and into the very start of 2020. Then COVID interrupted all this and rates briefly collapsed. Yes, port delays and other issues from COVID are helping keep rates higher, but this isn't just a temporary dislocation like tankers, the rates were already strong without COVID.

4) Shipping is a horrible sector and nobody can every make money in it!

I hear this a lot. It's just not true if you have access to good research and are nimble with your positions. I've beaten the industry average for 6 of 6 years (2015-2021 YTD) and I've beaten the Russell 2000 for 5 of 6 years (all except for 2020 where underperformed). It is important to watch out for governance. DryShips was one example of a horribly managed firm.

5) Won't liners just order more ships and destroy this amazing market:

The average delivery window for new ships ordered today is between mid-2023 and mid-2024. They can order them sure, and some have been, but this won't make much of any impact on current rates/balance. The shipping world erroneously believed that midsize tonnage was obsolete (i.e. either go huge for big scale or go really small for niche coastal trades), but that turned out to be completely wrong. Therefore there were almost zero midsized ships ordered between 2012-2020 and the fleet is fairly middleaged to older on average. Fleet growth might even be negative in some areas.

***Disclosure:*** I‚Äôm long nearly every name in the space- Atlas Corp, Capital Partners, Danaos Corp, MPC Containers (on the Oslo exchange), Navios Containers, Navios Partners, and Zim Integrated. I have a medium-term to longer-term constructive view on this space, but I do take profits to rationalize my portfolio when things surge. ""Diamond hands"" is a dumb meme. If there's a lot of volatility, I might be a seller or switch positions (for example, I sold CMRE earlier this morning and rolled it into ZIM).

I have about 10% of my wealth in the Navios names. Average basis in Navios Containers is in the lower-$1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. I previously sold 20% on 4 January at $4.44 and I sold 20% on 14 January at $5.49. I will probably sell another 15-20% in the $7s. I disclose all of my positions and trades in real-time (or as real-time as possible) on my research platform.

Literally my only instict was to double down and buy more and the only reason I didn't is because revolut had at this point blocked buying GME and AMC

If I think it through dropping the price so low while I had bought so much higher is the single best way to convince me to buy more, I would never accept such a big loss so the only option is to hold and wait until the price goes to the moon and if my only option is to wait for the price to go up it's only logical to buy more while it's low so I'll make a much bigger profit in the end

I know you say you can't read, but here it goes.

The last few weeks has been... lets say interesting.

Some of you mfers won it all, and some of you retards are left holding nothing but body bags.

Some made their first trade ever, got screwed real good, scared and pulled out of this world forever.

Others got bit by the bug and will try new moves to gamble away their fortune.

Some of you got out just in time with enough $ for a lifetime, and some will never recover.

That's how this game is. There is no mercy. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

Some played it well, some got carried away.

WSB is all about lossporn, fantastic memes, ballsy hits and the occational riches, so all is good.

And a big fucking thank you to the mods!



But some of you apes, are just to good to be true.

Please,  buy GME, AMC and all other memestocks as much as you want, please spend  your entire savings, please borrow money from your mothers boyfriend, extend your mortgage, sell your dog, Toyota Corolla  or your mouth on the corner below a GMEposter on the side of the  road for more stocks. Good for you!

But we dont care.

And that is the point.

Its time to move shop.

Move  far away with your HoLDiN TiLL I'm Dead, BuY The DIps, short ladder,  screw HF, and the other new words you learned a week ago.

Please bring your rockets with you, shuw them up your asses and fly to the fucking moon where the god damn gorillas can fist you dry. Good for you!

As  far as WSB are concerned, this run is over. It was fun and it was the  greatest play there has ever been, but for us, it is over.

There are dedicated subs for you gaping assholes. I can suggest [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), [r/AMCstock](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMCstock/) or even [r/Bondage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bondage/).

2/7/21 04:07,"All of this market manipulation from HF's over the past week may have just been what digs their grave deeper ‚õè Most people keeping up with the GME & AMC charts this week will have noticed or seen posts about the blatant correlation between them on the graphs, I saw a few posts yesterday in particular.

At this point it's pretty clear that there's not much organic movement going on when you notice how the spikes and dips were almost moving in unison

If it's an orchestrated or algorithmic trend that's being injected as a scare tactic to increase the volume of panic sellers, it probably started out as a great little idea. Bravo hedgies! üëè Probably treated themselves to a round of Don Perignon and a circle jerk after coming up with it.

But now that the week's shaken out and the prices are at a fairly low point compared to how the week started, it's probably time they realised how much of a short-sighted double edged sword they actually threw into the mix .

The psychological games would have no doubt worked on masses of paper handed bandwagon jumpers who bought 3 shares because their buddy gave them a Trading212 referral code and told them it was guaranteed money by Thursday. 

But that being said, with the Yin & Yang of how the stock market is. The consequences of them artifically dropping the price and scaring all of the flies with 3-6 shares a piece, is that they're just attracting the hornets who've analysed technical data for months/years and have amassed a decent amount of money in their portfolio to throw at the cause. 

The type of people that are holding at this point are the one's who see the bigger picture and are generally keeping an eye on volume/float etc.

And they're no doubt gonna want to capitalize on their chance to buy a dip and drop their average, not to mention the mentality shown across the board on this subreddit that says ""Every share we buy is a big fuck you"", to their chances of clawing back on this hefty bit of interest they're starting to accrue.

2/6/21 10:13,"The Market and Bots. An Enemy or a Friend ? Hello to every retard in this sub, DONT BE SPOOKED BY THE TITLE. I've noticed the past few days a lot of stuff mentioned about bots and how they are affecting the market prices, To be specific many refer to them as illegal actions. However bots are not illegal in most of the world's markets . Lets Focus on GME and AMC which are the main reasons people are concerned. There are many things happening on both of these stocks for sure, despite that fact lets be cautious, when we mention the world illegal. Bots are being used by both sides. We are using them in order to buy our stocks and sell them at specific prices and so are ''they'' (''they'' referring to the big companies such as JPM) more or less to control the price in their favor. There have been many cases where there have been manipulation concerns, but somehow the ones that commit the acts leading to that, always have their asses covered. Its important to understand though, that the fact ,that the graphs look alike, may not be only due to manipulation, but due to the fact that the investors , are more or less the same. That means that the bots they are using directly or indirectly ,meaning the ones provided by companies such as one's that RH, Capital etc. are 'using', are making the calls at the same time frame due to the way they have been programmed to work. So now on to the companies that are using them in a different way. These companies such as Citadel and JPM are trading between one another in order to drive the price where they want since they both participate in the hedge-fund. I understand this causes a misconception, that this is illegal but it's not. Its unethical, since many people may be feared into changing their mind, and there have been many people trying to change the regulations. However since bots are the ones determining the price of a stock, it can ''be tricked into ""believing"" that the price is lower than the actual one"". This has happened in the past and I will link an article which includes the instance which took place back in 2012 as far as I recall. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying nothing illegal is taking place, I just can't prove it. What I want you to pay attention to are the regulations these companies also have on bot trading or automated trading :

* New definitions for algorithmic traders
* Obligatory exchange controls for self-match prevention
* Registration criteria for direct connectivity to US-based FCMs and exchanges
* Pre-trade risk controls, including both cancellation systems and execution limits
* Compulsory testing environments and algorithm source code stores for automated trading systems

I want to underline that the issue might be on the 3rd regulation, and that's where illegal activity might be taking place, if anyone finds proof about that we need to do something about this. In addition to the previously mentioned, SEC is not a regulator of automated trading so any issues must be forwarded to either one of these :

* **US National Futures Association** ‚Äì Many USA day trading regulations stem from the NFA. Their aim to protect consumers while safeguarding the integrity of the markets.
* **US Commodity Futures Trading Commission** ‚Äì This agency is independent of the US government and oversees all FX brokers in the US. This body actively prosecutes companies who engage in fraudulent activity in the forex market.
* **FINRA** ‚Äì The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is a private corporation that conducts its activities as a self-regulated organization. They are primarily concerned with regulating stocks in the US. This is the body that imposes pattern day trading regulations.
* **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)** ‚Äì Created in 1974, this independent agency of the US government regulates futures and options markets. As detailed above, the CFTC also plays a role in algorithmic trading regulations.

When I have had money, I‚Äôve had no faith in myself so I‚Äôve never entered the market. That changed on January 8th of this year. I finally entered the market through Robinhood with my measly $700. 

Things started out slow up until this past week. I live in Northern California and there was a massive snowstorm here that knocked out power on Monday. This week, I have power through a generator. But I missed one of the biggest moments in U.S. history being without power from Monday until Saturday. I don‚Äôt own AMC nor GME stock but I do hold Express that was also affected by what RH did.

I was so excited when I first got power to see that my portfolio nearly doubled in that time. And express was a big part of that. I then felt sadness seeing my value drop when I heard what was going on. I wanted to sell my stock. But then Reddit suggested this sub to me and I read up on what‚Äôs been going on and you all have inspired me to hold on to my measly 20 shares. I will not let them get away with market manipulation. I will not be controlled. Many of you out there will never be mentioned by your usernames in the media or anything like that. Many of you are worth 5-8+ digits. But let me tell you.

AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC.


On February 1, 2021, Wanda America Entertainment, Inc. (‚ÄúWanda‚Äù) converted its Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the ‚ÄúClass B common stock‚Äù) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), into an equal number of the Company‚Äôs Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the ‚ÄúClass A common stock‚Äù), pursuant to the terms of the Company‚Äôs Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ‚ÄúCharter‚Äù). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.
 
The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.
 
The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:
 
Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company‚Äôs shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.
 
Economic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.  
 
Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company‚Äôs issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company's total number of authorized shares of capital stock.

The cost was 5$ that day and I opened my account on RH and by the time I had funds (also during the shut down) the price was around 17. 

Long story short, I managed to get 1546 or so shares at around 14.10 cost basis. I bought 6 GME at 118.

Little did I know the AMC hype at the time was due to GME momentum and so it's been closely tied to the price the whole time.

That said, my original intent was, they just got out of bankruptcy by raising 900m $$ the pandemic is ending with a hopeful vaccine deployment by end of spring and 2 years worth of movies backlisted from the pandemic. (2020 hits and now 2021 hits coming out)

On here, and on Twitter I‚Äôve suggested that it was inverted to the SPY chart which either some people correlated themselves or picked up and ran with my half ass comments. My half assed theory was mainly that MM may be over hedging their position and that the correlation is because AMC/GME have similar beta ratings. If the correlation is true it‚Äôs probably because the MM still could have much more money to loose.

2/6/21 11:58,"Mini-Tendies for Bag-Holders Good Evening Smooth-Brainers

Tonight I have a topic that has come up in the messages I received since my last post several times. I can safely assume that there are about 6million bagholders in this sub now as a result of the insane collapse of GME and AMC over the last 5ish trading days. I sincerely hope this information can benefit at least one of you monkeys.

The topic today is Selling Covered Calls against your shares. 

First of all, this only works if you have 100 shares or more. The reason for this is because each call you sell requires collateral of 100 shares (unless you already have a metric shit ton of money in your account and your broker lets you YOLO to your heart‚Äôs content).

‚ÄúBut Taco I only have 17 shares of XXX , can I sell part of a call?‚Äù What? No. 100 or bust. If you don‚Äôt have 100 shares you have two options: buy more shares to get to 100 or keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. 

This is how it works. I will use AMC as an example as it is more likely to be the stock that you apes have more than 100 shares of because you missed the boat on uber-cheap GME shares. As of 4pm EST, AMC was trading at $6.83. Yeah, that sucks if you bought this 15 or higher, but what are ya gonna do? Cry about it? No way. You got into this biz to make money, not be a chump.  I will be using 15 as the average price for my example below. 

Take those sets of 100 shares and make them work for you. Go look at the option chains in RH or whatever trading platform you are using. See there are two columns? Bid and Ask. Bid = Sell, Ask = Buy. Yeah, all these days/months/years you have been buying calls/puts you have been paying the Ask price. Now you are going to jump over to the greener side of the field and sell options to other apes.  (note: you cannot sell options after hours, so you gotta wait until Monday morning, sorry). 

So, now that you know what column to look at you are going to sell some calls. Pick the dollar amount you are happy with. If you want to at least break even in the absolute worst case scenario, choose 15. As 15 is pretty far away now, the premium is gonna be fairly terrible, but its your choice.  Once you sell the call you will receive the premium, which is the number in the Bid column. Congrats! You sold a call. Your shares made you a little bit of money. Now sit back and enjoy the ride.

‚ÄúBut what's our max loss?!‚Äù Easy. There is no loss. If you sold your options for 15 as I said above, if the stock ends up over 15 by the time the option expires, you will sell 100 shares for 15/share. Congrats you made even money on this trade and you get to keep the premium. If AMC is trading under 15 when the option expires, congrats you keep your 100 shares AND you keep the premium. Then do it all over again next week! Repeat until you lose your shares!

It seems complicated, but it is a fairly straight forward process.  As always I am happy to answer question, just shoot me a message as the comment section has been buggy as heck lately.

Jump on board the theta train and let the smaller tendies rain in!

1) Monkey buys shares of AMC

2) AMC go down. Monkey sad.

3) Monkey Sell call at breakeven or better to make back money.

2/8/21 09:39,"AMC: Not GME, an insider conundrum, and a ticking time bomb  Hi Everyone,

This post got a lot of great feedback in [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) so I figured I‚Äôd cross-post it here, without the options component and dumbed down a bit for the smooth brains here. For everyone considering an investment in GME's little sister - wanted to open the floor to a few facts and why AMC is not GME and how ""big finance"" has already dumped on retail investors, and why you should worry about round 2.

**1.** **You‚Äôve already gotten played and are licking some big finance nuts:**

In the midst of this mania, Silver Lake & Mudrick Capital, two scummy vulture investment firms have already blown their load on you and quietly extracted almost **$1 billion** dollars from retail investors and diluted the stock further. See [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E) and [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/mudrick-capital-gains-200-million-on-amc-gamestop-in-wild-week). These guys are celebrating the best play they've ever made on their yachts in the Hamptons right now... to put the size of this into perspective, the value of every AMC share combined was **$500M** two weeks ago.

**2.** **Most of you are too smooth-brained to understand dilution, so they‚Äôre buttering up your butthole for round 2**

A lot of you are saying the share price is barely above pre-COVID, so the downside doesn‚Äôt seem that bad if you‚Äôre bullish about the future of movies‚Ä¶ except you‚Äôre missing the real story...

The current MARKET CAP (value of all shares) is actually \~3.5X what it was, because there are now 3X as many shares, and they‚Äôre continuing to use an infinite money glitch to dump more shares on you because you haven‚Äôt noticed that and keep buying. It's basically a disguised stock split, where you're actually paying \~$21 to get the same ownership that you would have had pre-covid. See [here](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap).

*An analogy:* You sell your house in 2007 for 100k. In 2008, they offer to sell it back to you for the same price in the middle of the housing crisis. You LIKE THE STOCK, so you‚Äôre seriously considering it, even though your neighbors at Cinemark are down 40%. But there‚Äôs another catch ‚Äì the house now comes with 3 other roommates (dilution) and a mortgage (more debt) now, and they‚Äôre trying to sweep that under the rug and sell it to you for the same price anyways

**3.** **But forget the fundamentals, SHORT SQUEEZE!**

I'm weary of debating short interest %'s - I'll just say this - a squeeze is improbable, but not impossible in the short run. What we can agree on ‚Äì it‚Äôs a worse candidate than GME in pretty much every way with more float, less short interest, less concentration of shorts, and more volume. But the story get worse‚Ä¶

Unlike GME, AMC‚Äôs already told you that if the prices stay this way, they‚Äôre considering [whether to issue even more shares, dilute you further, and kill the short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-capitalraise-exclusive/exclusive-amc-entertainment-explores-new-capital-raise-amid-stock-surge-sources-idUSKBN29Y03C) for good.

**4.** **But wait, there‚Äôs more! The insider conundrum‚Ä¶**

What might seem bizarre and bullish is that based on the SEC filings to date, the largest insiders have NOT exited their positions yet, unlike insiders at several of the other pumped up stocks. Unfortunately, altruism and optimism are almost certainly not the explanation as share prices are/were still far above what they would've rationally expected for years to come. These insiders are bound by both SEC laws and their fiduciary duty - they can't say no to raising more capital if it's in the best interest of the company... but the SEC won't allow them dump their shares if they're on the verge of diluting them. They're mulling over the capital raise carefully, because doing so would also reduce the value of their stake unless they can put the cash to work in a value accretive way. They're left with two options:

\- Issue more shares and see if they can effectively take advantage of the cash in a way that overcomes dilution (e.g., buyback, content plays)

\- Wait until enough time has passed for their lawyers to clear them so they can blow their load on you too

**5.** **The play:** Both of the above will absolutely dilute you and kill the squeeze. I don‚Äôt recommend shorting this stock since I‚Äôm not ruling out a squeeze entirely in the short term, but this is NOT a game where you can just HODL forever. It's a ticking time bomb. I am/will be loading up on Put Debit Spreads as IV comes down.

tl:dr: AMC is disguised as a a cheaper version of GME, but it's a pump and dump scheme where big finance has already blown their load on you, and insiders are edging right now for round 2.

Disclaimer: This is not investment advice and I am not your financial adviser. Also not an endorsement of GME. But one of these two companies has issued more shares during the mania and has told you they're debating whether to do it again, and that creates a more interesting investment thesis than betting on reddit psychology for the next month.

Just spent 30 minutes on the line with Fidelity. Bottom line: if you have a **MARGIN** account with level 3 or 4 options approval, **THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES**.

However, you can request that they **DO NOT** lend *specific shares*, or even *all of your shares*. You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level.

Retirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are **NOT** being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have.

Non-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be ""un-shortable."" This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process.

I hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds.

I attempted to deposit cash countless times to cover the $1000.

RH fucked up a bank transfer

RH then deactivated and put cash backed shares on margin(with no ability to reactivate)

RH then did a margin call

RH sold +80% losses

RH immediately gave option to reactivate after sell.


RH is actually a fucking scam. They play so fucking dirty.

Edit: because I think you guys are missing my point. THEY DEACTIVATED THE ACCOUNT AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO COVER UNTIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER SELLING. I EMAILED AND REQUESTED ACCESS MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY EVERYDAY.

2/9/21 04:55,"Extra Dumb Question about AMC Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

I don't really know what to do about that, but I'm clearly not a bot and if you can think of a way for me to prove I'm not a shill, I'm all ears.

Second, as some of you know because you've complained about it every time I do it, I've been posting a help message into the big threads on this subreddit, telling people that they can reach out and that they're not alone. I've received messages from over 500 people in the last 4 days, and they're all just happy to have someone to talk to, and to listen to them. Some of them only have a share or two of GME or a few dozen AMC, and some people bought in for over $100,000. 

Almost all of them are selling, or have already sold, and absolutely none of them are buying more. I would estimate, conservatively, that 4 out of 5 people who message me have already sold, and half of the ones who haven't tell me that they're going to ASAP. All of them find me from my posts on this subreddit, which is the most bullish place for GME that exists on the internet, and they're **still** all selling. Please, please, just sort by new on some of these threads, or on the subreddit's front page. Sort by new and read through the posts, and recognize that the sentiment you're seeing on the big posts on here does not reflect the majority, or reality.

Make your own decisions and do what's best for you, but please, understand that nobody is still in this. You are buying into a lie that is being pushed by people who are either trying to make money off of you or don't know any better and NEED to believe that this is going to come back up.

Its going to continue to drop so wait for that shit to go down to the dollar. We don't know if there's gonna be another squeeze by how the hedgies and RH screwed us over the first time. Them having all the bananas probably have found other ways to screw us over by now. Even Mark's AMA had a lot of ""next time you'll come back smarter"" phrasing as in the shit that happened here was phenomenal but most likely will have failed.

If it does fail, at least some people were early to buy nuggies. But people buying now is your own risk and not a meme. If it does fail, people well sell with well cash made. When that happens all the late apes will be left to dry for ""long term investing"" to hide the fact they literally lost thousands. And while losing thousands is great for meme purposes on this sub, all the newcomers are gonna be staring at the charts 24/7 never coming off the toilet.

If all you people who lost a ton of money do get gains somehow (because remember, people already HAVE gains, they just lost some because of the hedgies and want it back or some already cashed out with multi tendies) then consider yourselves lucky because these stocks are dropping and will continue to drop for a while and not everyone will have diamond hands.

Its hard to keep a meme going for so long. The memes are the only thing really pushing this. Once the meme dies, so does the volume. All the inexperienced traders don't know all the other smooth brained people are used to losing will continue to trade like normal, and they'll have nothing left but to stare at their loss cause of a meme and their poor timing to jump on a a bandwagon all late.

On a lighter note. If you already own GME or AMC don't sell yet, there's a good chance we'll at least get a small squeeze. Just don't be an actual retard and lose your life savings over this and keep buying when it hasn't finished dropping. And if you do buy.. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Diamond hands.

2/7/21 05:31,"Some Smoothbrain Real Talk for Everyone at WSB Okay dumb-dumbs since I'm seeing the gain porn and lecturing from long time members here's a story for you all idiots that I think might help.

I've never really invested in a portfolio. My whole life I was taught two things: **keep your money in safe, steady growth locations, have have multiple locations.** So, that's what I've done. I have a savings account, a Roth IRA, a retirement fund, and as of May 2020, a portfolio. I started real small, with $1000. That money quickly grew to about $1300 and I realized that I could make smart buying decisions based on the news and my friend's (who is a CFA) advice). He convinced me to invest in some tech stonks early on as well as some other endeavors that have paid out handsomely. Not much in terms of gross $$, but from a % growth standpoint the money was huge.

Over time I started putting money that would normally go into my savings into my portfolio because, well, it was growing so much faster. I had a lot of growth off of tech stock investments, and now I have my hands in some fairly lucrative pies. **I then learned about WSB in mid-January and saw everything that was going on with GME, et. al.** I was skeptical, so I watched the market for a while. I thought 'oh hey, this could be a fun gamble, let's play ball.' I bought 10 shares of BB at $10. As it blew up I prowled the posts and saw that while GME was at $50, AMC was only at $5, and the plan to squeeze was targeted at both of them. So I bought 60 shares of AMC @ $5. A few days later, specifically, on January 29th, my money had exploded so I said okay one more small buy. I tossed in for 1 share of GME at $320, three shares of KO$$ at 69. **One hour later RH restricted buying.**

I guess I should've just dumped everything right there but I loved the camaraderie that I saw here. Obviously, I knew that a reddit sub wasn't about to take down any major hedge funds, but I did see an opportunity to expose these assholes like in 2008. So I held. Then when GME started to fall, I bought another 4 shares at $85, and I tossed my remaining balance on AMC. Everything together we're looking at about $1,500 put toward this effort.

Obviously, the outlook isn't a whole lot better today than it was this time last week. And yet, I'm holding. Why? Why would I hold after admitting I made an objectively stupid series of buys? Answer: Because I can afford to, and because I like to gamble. It's fun to me. I'm not rich by any measure, but I'm smart enough to understand that this is a group of RETARDS who know very little about finances. So I wanted to have fun with it, and I decided to invest about 10% of my portfolio into this mess. That said, my portfolio only makes up about 10% of my total net worth, if even that much. **So, at best, I've invested 1% of my net worth into this ""movement.""**

The moral of my story should be clear:

# You're all idiots. I'm an idiot. This is DUMB.

But it's also fun. And you know what? If you put 80% of your life savings into buying GME at $350, you're a fucking dumbass. That is not, and has never been how money works. **These guys posting loss and gain porn on this site? There's what, two dozen of them? Out of 8,500,000?!** Come on, stop. You think you're going to outsmart a series of billionaires just because some guy who bought 50,000 shares of a dead stock in July said it might work one of these days? Stop it, get some help.

And to the ""OG members"" who think that they are just so smart for manipulating the market at a FRACTION of the efficiency, stealth, and organization that hedge fund operators do it EVERY DAY, I say you can lick my nutsack from the back. Cool, a couple hundred people got lucky and ya caught Melvin off guard for a week. But honestly, shame on you assholes for screaming ""HOLD HOLD HOLD"" when GME was tanking from 400 all the way down to 120. **People were watching their lives disintegrate because of a damn joke that they weren't in on from the gate.** Guess what, you're Melvin now. You fucked the little guy and got rich doing it. How's it feel?

2/7/21 04:19,"Help me understand AMC So in the 8-k filed on January 25th, AMC said the Silverlake would get 44 million shares from converting their senior note.  Silverlake dumped those 44 million shares between $13 to $16/share...smart move for them bad for AMC shares holders.  In that 8k AMC also said they would issue 50 million new shares, to be sold ...whenever. I'm seeing reports that they sold at least some of them in the $10+ range.  So the question i have is two fold:

1. I see all these people posting short interest %...how do they actually know if AMC can randomly sell new shares?

2. Why are people bullish on AMC with all of the dilution? They have sold new shares multiple times since October.  The price should be less than $2 if you just look at dilution.

2/7/21 04:16,"How I think AMC is not worth $1 *I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.*

Hi everyone, hope you're having a peaceful Saturday. The Super Bowl is coming up, so I hope you guys in America enjoy it.

This post is for AMC, as this is what I've been playing close attention to. After doing some of my own research, I've concluded that AMC isn't worth $1 as many analysts have mentioned in their analysis, and I think it should be much higher. It all comes down to the fundamentals of the film industry.

How film studios and distributors make money is primarily based on theatre attendances. Usually, a portion of profits made from theatre tickets goes to theatre owners. The majority of the rest goes to the studio and distributor. The amount is organised through a contract between the exhibitor and the studio before the film is aired; usually, it's a 60/40 split, with 60% of the ticket revenue going to the studio. You can read more about how movies make money here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp)

As long as this fundamental is in place, the film studios and distributors will keep airing their films in theatres and cinemas. Although streaming services are the future of entertainment, they won't be able to replicate the same big-screen experience that many do enjoy. Furthermore, they won't provide the same profit margins for film studios as a regular theatre would do. It all boils down to the streaming service business model.

A prime example of this is when Disney aired the live-action film Mulan on Disney+. You had to pay the $30 early-access fee on top of the regular $6.99 per month subscription to get into Disney+. Logically, there was a big backlash behind this move, with many calling it a ""daylight robbery"". This defeats the purpose of a streaming subscription business model; the whole point is that you pay a small fee per month to gain access to a large amount of content. Having a rental that costs more than a regular rental and even more than a regular ticket, is counterintuitive to the business model.

Now take the fundamentals of the film industry into account, and it doesn't add up. If the streaming platform sets a $20-30 fee on a film, no one pays to watch it. If they set no fees at all, then the film studio won't make their money back.

So, as long as this fundamental is in place, AMC will continue making money in the future. AMC has set up private theatre rentals, screening old classics and airing new films from 2021 into 2022. And as long as big film studios advertise people to watch their movies in theatres, AMC will go on.

Now that bankruptcy is off the table, and vaccinations are ramping up, we'll slowly return to normal. I can see the stock being back to $10-20 again.

**TL;DR:** As long as film studios advertise to go to the theatres, AMC won't go anywhere.

*Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.*

Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** u/ActuaryExpert8729 commented on something that adds more to the argument that AMC will do fine. The COVID-19 Relief Package signed in December 2020 sets aside $15 billion of financial support to movie theatres and live event venues. There's probably a fund for film studios as well.

2/7/21 07:37,"Just a thought... First, the formalities:
Not exactly new to investing, but still going through my paces. New to WSB, fresh retard here, bough into FOMO, holding because I have nothing much left to lose. 13 shares of GameStonks @130 avg. 11 of AMC at ""idc, like $13 or something""

Now. I see so many posts about ""you only see the message the mods want you to see"" and also do many ""sell and cut your losses"" posts.
But I've also seen some well thought out DD on GME, and I have massive confirmation bias for this, seeing as I'm banking on it to go up to ""win my money back"" (money I *could* lose, but really don't want to.)
I'm not selling, I don't have too much left to lose at this point, I'd rather stay in it on the chance of a second squeeze.

But back to the main idea here: I've seen a lot of ""sell, cut your losses, reinvest"" posts. I've seen a few notably good DD's on a probable second GME squeeze.
I'll two and two together, and that adds up quite nicely with that old advice about ""buy when others are selling"".
Point is, I got into this on mob mentality and hype. I learned my fuvking lesson about that, and now I'm sitting on >50% loss. But it doesn't seem quite right to get out of this on mob mentality, right after learning that lesson.

Two reason's I'm staying and holding then:
1. I have little left to lose on this, I believe that GME fundemental are changing enough so that selling now would be at a low, which is a terrible. ""How much worse can it get?"". I'm willing to gamble what I have left for the next week or three on the DD and possible second squeeze.
2. If everyone is here for thier own gain, and everyone really IS manipulating my noobiness for thier own profit, and those same people are the ones telling me to sell, then I'm not fucking selling. I'm not selling and getting left in the dust like this. If have to die on this hill, then good luck killing me, because I already have.

I have a gut feeling that this is the dark part of the tunnel, and I'm not quitting just because I can't see the light at the other end. This is the part of the movie where all seems lost, right before the final spectacular triumph. I'm gonna be there for the end.

To all the other holders out there:

If you can pull out with gains, or at least minimal losses, then evaluate your position and decide what is best for your situation, your mental health, and your long-term stability. Don't gamble your life on a meme, even if it's more than just a meme. Keep a stock as a souvenir or a ticket to the launch, if you do decide to leave. I think you would regret selling at a loss now, but there's the chance that it could be the right decision. Either way, pull through and commit to and live with that decision. Most importantly, take away your lessons. Write them down, or tell someone else exactly how you feel right now, and what you think you should remember from this.

If you're in this like me, balls deep and waiting for the squeeze, then I think our best move is to HOLD together. I don't think that selling for substanial losses is worth it at this point. Look at it. You sell now for -50% or more, decide to take a break, put it in an index or something and it grows a measly 8%? Meanwhile, you'll be glued to GME. Imagine if it moonshots. Your realized losses might feel bad, but it will be all that much worse if just a week or even a day later it moons, and you took your losses in vain. I think the game is worth it.

Either way, I would wait for us to get numbers on the 9th, that's when we will be the best informed to make our decisions. I foresee a lot of quality DD on that data we get, so watch out for that.
Hedges seem scared, that gives me a bit of heart too. What have they to be scared of if it's all truly over?


TL;DR: 
Ignore the haters, check your fundamentals, make a realistic assessment of your situation and your risk. Wait for the data on the 9th.
If minimal losses or gains, I suggest hold, as this is probably rock bottom, and we only go up from here. But make your own decision, based on your financial stability.
If balls deep and all in, I say HOLD, and hold strong through this week.
We're in the worst part of it right now, but no one ever said it would be easy. The best things never are.

As a holder of GME shares (and also AMC, BB, and NOK shares) reading this article gave me a lot of hope. In the past two weeks, we've been accused of being an echo chamber and supporting confirmation bias. We've even been called a delusional loser cult by our many haters who are desperate for us to sell our GME shares. Therefore reading this article from a respected objective source like Investor Place really made me feel good after a long time.

For those who don't want to read the entire article, the author writes a warning to the short sellers. He writes that short-sellers/bears are used to speculators who invest in stocks for profit. Short-sellers know how to deal with these speculators because speculators scare easy and will usually cut their losses, sell, and invest in different stock. However, the author states that short sellers should be very worried because these retail investors from r/WSB are of a different breed. Most are willing to just buy and hold stock. Just buy and hold. The retail investors can hold far longer than the short-sellers/bears would like. Furthermore, according to the author, if these retail investors continue to buy and hold, a short squeeze is possible.

Please read this article and allow hope to fill your body. Damn right we're a different breed! Our tenacity and patience knows no bounds! We will buy and hold until we win! Either through a short squeeze or through the company turning successful under Ryan Cohen's leadership. Either way, we win! This is why we're diamond hand apes! 

Also to the haters and OGs who keep saying that they're tired of GME threads/posts, I have a message for you. We're not going anywhere. Whine and bitch all you want but you best get used to ignoring our threads. The first share I bought in my entire life has been these GME shares. I invested my entire life savings in BANG gang! I'm down 80% on my investments and I will not cut my losses. For one thing, if I cut my losses, I won't have money to invest in any other stocks. Second, my mama didn't raise no quitter!

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

Yahoo Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as ""Neutral"" despite the amount of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term. People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is neither stock dead in the water yet? Why do both stocks show more resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily. Everyone is waiting until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can make ""easy money"".

Consensus: Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum that GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME because they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike wasn't relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point, AMC's shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype). If the momentum dies, then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this stock are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price for months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of having to pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the people shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck off.

If the momentum  dies,  then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this  stock  are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price  for  months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of  having to  pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the  people  shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck  off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

2/12/21 03:47,"$SONO DD Alright autists, going to give you a real simple DD that everyone can understand.

Remember when $PTON was trading in the $20s? Let me remind you... There was this flashy exercise bike company that thought they would take the home gym market by storm. It was slow, but then the pandemic hit. There was a huge shift to home gyms and $PTON crushed earnings in May 2020. Their stock rocketed to $43 and the rest is history.

I am happy to say that the $PTON rocket to $43 in May 2020 is where we are today with $SONO.

$SONO just reported earnings ($1.17 EPS) that beat estimates ($.88 EPS). Along with that, they raised their 2021 revenue ($1.6b) and earnings targets -

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sonos-easily-tops-revenue-estimates-as-pandemic-fuels-continued-boom-in-speaker-sales-11612991269?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sonos-easily-tops-revenue-estimates-as-pandemic-fuels-continued-boom-in-speaker-sales-11612991269?siteid=yhoof2)

But back to why this makes sense from a trend perspective. First off, $SONO has industry leading sound quality for home audio. I own it. It is amazing. The reason I bought it was, after a long search, they were the only true wireless surround sound (and full home audio) company out there. Their tech is very far ahead of their competitors and it shows with constant growth in revenue.

But, the main trend... Warner Bros is releasing blockbusters to HBO Max the same day as theaters, Netflix subscriptions are up, Disney is releasing movies same day to Disney+, streaming services are popping up left and right... AMC and other theaters are HURTING and might not hold on. There is a massive shift to in-home theaters and $SONO dominates when it comes to in-home audio.

In the future, they will partner with some fancy new EV company for in-car audio. They have plans to do that.

Anyway, I see $SONO going to $70 by EOY.

Positions -

6 3/19 $40c

33 7/16 $45c

3 shares @ $36.06

TLDR - Buy $SONO. Trend to in-home theater and audio is just beginning to be noticed. Lagged the in-home gym trend, but is a bigger market. $SONO is the industry-leader in performance and only true full-home wireless audio company out there. In-car audio coming soon. $70 EOY PT.

2/12/21 21:03,"AMC - THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER! A quick update on new information for all my fellow bag holder apes.

What's the case with AMC? Is the run over? Has the squeeze squozed?

No.

AMC's price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze. People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB.

This, also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC. A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum. Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC. That, accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members, caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance - i.e. FUD.

The number one rule of marketing is ""never create high expectations that you cannot meet"". Why? Because, while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term, it will damage your brand and your company's success in the long-term. The same rule applies to practically everything else. In AMC's case, high expectation was created, dates were given, and when those expectations were left unmet - novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares.

Accompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right, data manipulation, etc. I personally believe that this is what drove the price down. Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here, but I'd rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations.

Hedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security.

With all of that being said, why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode?

Utilization rate was 91.4% on the 8th of February:

And has since dropped to 88.4%, which is still quite high.

What this shows us is that about 89% of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed. However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased - from 81.7m to 82.3m.

This just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow - recently bought shares.

What else do we know?

We now know, thanks to Fidelity, that retail ownership of the stock is 87.5%!!!!

**Why's this exciting? Well, if we look at the exciting case of VolksWagen (VW):**

The short interest of the stock was about 13%. The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74%. Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply (holders) were willing to give for it. Simply because they can do that.

So hedges have two options, accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock. Or, keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR, which changes literally everyday based on the volume.

Institutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC:

Vanguard - 55.46% increase worth, I dunno but they have bought 2.7M new shares.

Blackrock - 69% increase worth $13.17M

Northern Trust Corp - 41% increase worth $2.12M

And many more who bought into the stock recently:

We're also seeing a lot of people reporting that when they attempt to short the stock they are receiving error messages telling them **""This stock is hard to borrow"".**

**Such as Etrade:**

Which also reported that the available shares to short are 460k with a borrow fee of 4.5%.

Another report from NakedShortReport

shows us that the short volume of AMC was 40% yesterday.

Naked short report collect their data from FINRA. But it's interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21% short volume. I've genuinely lost all hope in them by now.

**CONCLUSION**

What this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now.

Don't lose hope and hold your positions if you can. If you can't that's fine. Look after yourself first.

This is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of - Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions. This is probably the best stock to train that element.

Invest what you are willing to lose - especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC.

**For all of us who are still holding - stay strong. This might prove to be beneficial.** However, this is no guarantee, obviously.

Take everything I've said with a grain of salt and do your own research. I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation.

2/8/21 05:58,"AMC GOOD LONG TERM? (Buy/Hold) Edit: I am aware of the possible squeeze incoming and am already in possession of 7 amc @3.43 I just really UNIRONICALLY like the stock

Edit 2: Someone let me know that I had made a clerical error, 99 billion should have been 9.9 billion

Hello, I have been a lurker of the sub for just over 2 years, this is my first DD so please don't hold back and let me know what my blind spots are.

AMC is currently trading at 6.83 when im writing this and I see it possibly going a little lower but I do believe that ~ 7$ is a good price for this stock considering the rebound it could make in the coming months/years.

AMC and theaters in general are a very important part of American culture, or at least have been for a long time, covid could change all of this I am aware; however I do not believe that hollywood is willing to give up a 9.9 Billion dollar a year industry because someone ate batman. In 2019 theaters generated an estimated revenue of 9.9B this number fell harshly and predictibly due to Covid laws, but their alternative was something no one even considered trying. Paying $30 to watch a movie via a streaming platform... This is something I think even idiots look at and think ""wow this is a rip"", and there is no alternative to this as movie studios simply cannot rely on subscription revenue to create a movie that can survive by todays standards.

One of the major things about theaters that draws people in is the sheer quality of the tech, where as we could spend 10 or 20 thousand on a tv and sound system, these theaters spend that per speaker, for an uncompromised experiance unobtainable at home without cutting edge and expensive technology that is by no means ""popular"" or ""accessible"".

My personal opinion is that AMC will probably climb past the 10$ mark when they can resume normal operation, me and all of my friends have been talking about theaters and how they are in a ""make-it-or-break-it"" scenario, this is probably my biggest worry in terms of this stock, there is a VERY real chance that people will simply not care about theaters after all this is over, but I am counting on Hollywood to not let that happen, I believe they would fight tooth, nail, and every apendage they had to keep theaters in America.

ACTUAL DD:

Old Financials: Prior to COVID-19, AMC had found itself in a small rut of sorts, their overall revenue was only up .19%, they were spending much more on advertisements than usual and they were also dealing with a lower than average operating income (down 48.68% 2018-2019) and they finished out the year in debt, they had lost 149.10M

New Financials: 2020 has been an absolute shit show for AMC, they are down across the board by > 90%, and their last reported operating income in september was -675.40M and the finished the year out 905.80M in the red. Q1 2020 obviously had lessened effects on the company as the US was undecided for a while on how seriously we were going to take it.
Their Gross profits have also fallen:
Q4 (2019): +939.60M - (+3.15%)
Q1 (2020): +616.40M - (-20.32%)
Q2 (2020): +14.20M - (-98.75%)
Q3 (2020): +84.10M - (-89.90%)
It is also worth mentioning their net income across the quarters has went from -149.10M in Q4 2019 to -3.64B Q3 2020

OPINION: I think that AMC is currently in a dangerous predicament in terms of hemmoraging money each quarter, however I do believe that Hollywood has enough of a vested interest to turn this into a possibly money maker. No one is calling for theaters to go away, people like them and they enjoy the atmosphere that comes with the experiance, we love the memes of a 20$ popcorn and a 50$ soda, but I really believe Americans like the cinema.

Position: 20 Jan 23 3.5$ call I belive in AMC long-term (at least for the next few years), I am very much so considering a LEAPs position on AMC, I wouldn't be mad being stuck with 100 shares of AMC, and considering the risk and reward, my breakeven is $8.50, I really believe that sometime between now and 2023 AMC will at LEAST go to 8.50, hopefully higher, but if lower than its DIAMOND HANDS INTO THE GROUND.

TLDR: AMC has issues and its a gamble, but goddamnit I like it

2/8/21 05:44,"The sub is divided and you're creating a cult. Hey guys, I've been following WSB for years now, but only recently started posting.

I'm worried that the sub is getting divided because of extremists on both sides of the whole GME saga. There's people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like ""short squeeze,"" ""counterfeit shares,"" learning what a Bloomberg terminal is etc etc. Listen - that's amazing. I love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.

What I worry about is that BECAUSE people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they're the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. One one of the recent top posts was comparing the GME and AMC charts, saying how similar they were. Everyone in the comments was screaming ""MAHNEEPULASHIONNNNNN."" COULD it have been manipulation? I mean... yes... But market **correlation** is very, very common and normal. I don't think I need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. Now, I'm not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as I don't know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn't mean shit.

PLEASE do your research before posting this shit. This is why the vets are pissed at all the GME pumping: it's in large by people who don't know what they're talking about. Not everyone who's done with GME is a Melvin bot, as much as you'd like to believe. It's all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. I do hold some GME and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. If you have a thesis that you believe in, you should ALWAYS know the bearish case too. Consider what the other side is saying too. You'll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you'll realize maybe you were wrong.

The other side of the story is the OGs who have also been around for years. I see why you're pissed. The sub has changed tremendously over the last month. At the same time, I want you guys to also remember that this GME thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. It's not exactly the essence of WSB to teach people (lol) BUT if you just leave comments saying ""you're an idiot."" or ""you should have sold like I did retard"" you're only making the problem worse.

If you've been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. Then we can continue losing money together in peace.

2/8/21 05:24,"MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I‚Äôm gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there‚Äôs more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,

Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol‚Äô USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the ‚Äúbetting‚Äù portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I‚Äôm starting top down with this masterpiece. 

Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. 

Karsan - I can‚Äôt see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it‚Äôs a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. 

Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was ‚Äúzero-emission‚Äù. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they‚Äôll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren‚Äôt all that practical or possible. 

The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there‚Äôs no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‚Äò87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. 

Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy‚Äôs current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don‚Äôt see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they‚Äôre gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that‚Äôs currently burning cash like it‚Äôs their fucking job. 

THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. 

Enough about the contract though, let‚Äôs talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn‚Äôt talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there‚Äôs a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). 

Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she‚Äôs grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she‚Äôs not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. 

Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there‚Äôs another form of revenue the company has going for it. 

It‚Äôs a growth stock with a lot of potential and it‚Äôs logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. 

Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I‚Äôve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there‚Äôs plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all here right? 

Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16.

The specific part of the discussion I‚Äôll highlight is *whether or not hedge funds or others in power manipulated the market by influencing the closure of trades on platforms such as Robinhood*. Like many of you, I almost immediately believed that this was a direct attack on retail to prevent any astronomical effect on $GME, but later changed my stance to the following and see that many of you share this stance too, based on your own DD: 

*the attack was never meant to prevent $GME from exploding, $GME was a distraction from the true threat, $AMC* 

Now before you downvote I will say that I still think $GME had potential to reach new heights based on my own DD, and it has nothing to do with the ‚Äú177% float‚Äù we‚Äôre not exactly sure about. However, I personally believe $AMC has more practical long term potential. It was almost certain $AMC would be going out of business, which was good news for a lot of shorts‚Äîa no-brainer, if you will.

Now, I‚Äôm sure a lot of you (if not most of you) are more experienced, more talented, smarter traders than myself, but this remains common sense to me which is why I still maintain this opinion: at a time (covid) when theaters were ghost towns, the end wasn‚Äôt even remotely in sight, and the theater industry already in decline‚Äîwhen theaters were arguably at an all time low, imagine what might happen if the stock price was virally launched into heights unseen since A YEAR before the pandemic. Based on the simple principals of trading I was introduced to, I‚Äôm inclined to believe this would destroy many, many plans and have a historical affect on the price of an $AMC share.

Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong through, tell me I‚Äôm missing something. Tell me that $6.00 isn‚Äôt a killer deal for what might be the most undervalued stock of the year, amidst an already crazy year. Please, someone convince me not to put a... *thrilling*... amount of money on $AMC at open. I want to be wrong so you save me the time I‚Äôll spend on this subreddit and Twitter these next few months.

2/8/21 06:20,"Starting 2022 movie theaters, such as AMC, will be able to own streaming services and streaming services such as Netflix will be able to own theaters. Paramount vs United States was an anti-trust decree that prohibited movie theaters from producing their own movies or production companies from owning movie theaters. The court granted the DOJ's motion to lift the decrees on August 7, 2020, starting a two-year sunset termination period of the decrees. This might be good news for struggling movie theaters such as AMC, as they can now be acquired by Amazon or Netflix without violating any anti-trust laws.

2/8/21 09:19,"Is AMC at the current price ($6.83) a good deal? Some of you are of the belief that AMC is post-pandemic value play. And that once the pent up demand for seeing movies in theaters is unleashed that AMC will be revitalized and soaring back to it's $30 share price from a few years ago. There is one big problem with that - AMC is already valued well above what it was leading up to the pandemic. 

For AMC to reverse course, soaring back to it's 2017 highs - a $3.27 billon market cap - that's really only about $9.41 a share based on todays number of shares outstanding. 2017 had also seen operating revenue soar from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion (growth that it came nowhere near sustaining). The following 2 years had $5.4 billion in revenue along with increasing long term debt. 

[https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#)

Silver Lake converting $600 million of notes into equity was certainly a fortunate turn of events for AMC.  While this may take bankruptcy off the table,  there are still [debt problems](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-debt-soars-as-company-claims-to-have-staved-off-bankruptcy-62274670) remaining.  Long Term debt had already more than doubled between [2017 and 2019](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#) \- from $4.8 billion to $9.7 billion. 

I at one point bought into the AMC hype and that it would be heading for the moon - and for a moment it did. The reality is that if you bought in under $4 you've already done very well - and perhaps far better than you should have expected. 

Even AMC at $4.50 values the company about where it was January 2, 2018. Pre-pandemic, pre-Silver Lake loan and almost $5 billion less in long-term debt.  

Do you what you want.

2/8/21 08:47,"Some AMC ‚ÄúDD‚Äù for the average ü¶ç I‚Äôve seen a few people finally bring up AMC as something more than GME‚Äôs honorable mention. I‚Äôm just a casual trader who was holding 1k of AMC and some option contracts before this clown fiesta of a market trend showed up. I‚Äôve done a fair amount of ‚ÄúDD‚Äù on AMC, but this is more conceptual potential based off news articles. Don‚Äôt expect math or grounded market concepts from this since that‚Äôs pretty far out of my trading style. Although, here are some key factors that have made me vary bullish on AMC before all this artificial price inflation.

Let talk about the AMC is a dying business concept. I don‚Äôt believe that in the slightest. I mean yes it‚Äôs much easier to stay and home and stream new movies, and yes a lot of big name producers have been dabbling with the straight to streaming release concept. Although, most of the titles being released straight to streaming have been smaller budget titles that weren‚Äôt expected to pull huge crowds in theater. With the exception of the new Wonder Woman and Pixar movies. That being said the budget for WW was 200 million and for Soul it was over 150 million. These budgets are common place for big block buster now a days. A fraction of $7-$12 subscription fee would likely have profits that would break even on budgets this large. Defiantly when you factor in costs of other movies and original content that is also in production. No movie producer is looking to break even on budget costs. They want huge profits margins which are mostly realized in box office sales.

This brings us to the life cycle stage of movies and how it maybe changing for the better going forward. The life cycle of a movie after production is typically: 

Theaters, on demand/Blue-ray, streaming services, and lastly day time tv.
Box office sales are typically where most of the profit is realized. On demand and blue-ray are worth mentioning, but the second biggest income is obviously stream services renting the rights to have them on their platforms. No matter how you look at this eliminating the box office releases is just throwing away millions in potential profits. It really doesn‚Äôt make sense to do that. Especially with this new game changing deal that was recently struck with Universal studios. [Here‚Äôs the article ](https://qz.com/1885992/universals-deal-with-amc-is-huge-for-the-movie-industry/)
This basically says that the amount of time for a theatrical release will be weeks instead of months. This deal was actually a power play by AMC where they said they wouldn‚Äôt show anymore Universal Studios movies in their theaters if Universal started doing more straight to streaming releases. Obviously there was a compromise reached in the interest of both parties, but it goes to show that a big name like Universal Studios values the box office greatly. Also, this deal opens up so many door for even platforms like Netflix to release their more notable movies in theater first. Netflix has in the past considered theatrical releases but could never agree on the 90 day release timeframe.

Next, I should talk about how AMC‚Äôs stock price has fallen so low based off the fact that they were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Basically, AMC has been selling stock and taking loans to give itself just the smallest amount of runway to keep afloat for another month. Although, now talk of bankruptcy is in the rear view window. This is widely due to you delinquents blowing up their stock‚Äôs value. 
[Here‚Äôs another arrival on that](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/amp/) 
Now they went from having a month or so of runway to enough to last them well into 2021. That‚Äôs not to mention a lot of movie deals that are reaching into as far as 2023. 

I might be missing some recent news points, but these factors; along with the fact that vaccines most likely being available to the general public in a few months, gives me a lot of hope for AMC‚Äôs future. My DD is pretty bare minimum and fuck if I know if they are viable for a short squeeze? Even if they aren‚Äôt I‚Äôm sure they will get some attention in the hype if GME still has a chance. None of this is financial advice by the way. All in all I just like the stock.

TLDR, 
1) Block buster movie budgets are $100‚Äôs of million and box office revenue is always just going to be extra millions of profit.
2) New movie deals will bring 90 day theatrical release windows to 17 days. Making theaters even becoming approachable for platforms like Netflix.
3) Threat of bankruptcy is pretty much gone. Plenty of runway funding for the future.

$KO is one of those companies that were hit by the pandemic. As you may or may not know, their primary source of income is not the 15 bottles you swig every day, rather the franchise deals they make with restaurants, stadiums, $AMC, and so on, and in case you haven't noticed, these things have been shut down for a while, which means bad numbers.

2/9/21 00:18,"Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.

Their reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.

To preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout ""market manipulation"" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).

The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:

My screenshot (02/05/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b

The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.

Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on ""updating data"".

I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.

However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.

Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.

My screenshot (02/06/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d

As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).

In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.

I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?

There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff

Here's the email he received.

Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.

Thoughts.

P.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.

P.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!

Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:

""Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn‚Äôt up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.

Are you certain the chart isn‚Äôt updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I‚Äôll resolve your ticket but I‚Äôm still here if you reply.""

I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say ""oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more ""accurate"" measurements to our users"". Ya know?

**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**

**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.

His post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**

And for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**

So their excuse is a ""programming error"". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).

I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**. Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. It would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in VALHALLA

2/8/21 18:00,"AMC Major Stakeholder Wanda Converts Stock To Allow For Sale A major Chinese investor in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) converted its shares in the cinema operator in order to be able to sell them, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.

The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $2.5 billion in May 2012.

Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.

The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.

In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.

Price Action: AMC shares closed nearly 3.7% lower at $6.83 on Friday and gained almost 0.6% in the after-hours session.

2/8/21 14:09,"PDC Newsletter: Trading Week Ending 2/12 Dear Member,

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on February 12th? We hope that this email finds you well and not dead from the Meme Stonk War of 2021.

Compared to the last few weeks, we have a relatively boring week coming up. Our primary goal is to move our assets into areas that will produce steady gains. I have two focuses with this.

1. Use the current situation to optimize gains through high risk and volatile stocks that could shoot us in the foot.
2. Acquire holdings that will let us cash in on the technological transition over the coming years
3. I know, it was intended to be two, but let's be real. We are definitely going to hold out buying power for options on the Disney earnings report!

My first thoughts here are that our situation doesn't allow for high quality options trading given that there are huge transitions occurring within the retail investor. We have a horde of idiots moving on from GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. They have no idea what to do other than go back on the Palantir train. With these things in mind, we're going to make a couple safer plays this week and minimize new options.

Worth noting, but not detailed this week is a movement of long holding funds into ARK related ETFs (including PRNT). After reading through ARK's Big Idea's 2021, I truly believe their ETFs are going to obliterate the S&P over the coming 6-12 months. This is heavily dependent upon how much innovation occurs and is facilitated by the government. If the current trend continues, they're going to average well over 20% this year due to the needs of companies moving into new sectors of technology. I don't know which will be the most notable; so, I've chosen to hold all of their assets.

&#x200B;

* DIS (The Mouse)
   * It's time to bet the house on The Mouse. With earnings coming up after hours Thursday 2/11, they're going to continue their pop they've been showing over the previous week. It's VERY tough to tell where they're going to end the week, but this is a prime opportunity to do some quality percentage gains on OTM calls. If you're looking at high premiums, make sure you're careful to play the higher traffic options so that you don't get burned. I'll personally recommend steering clear of the $200 number unless you're willing to risk it all. Disney clearing the $200 mark this week would be massive. The lower premium makes it enticing, but it won't happen unless their subscriber numbers are through the roof. For me, I'm shooting for $190 in hopes of getting a quality OTM to ITM transition and then dumping it at open on Friday.

&#x200B;

* CVS (You know you want to do it...)
   * WIth earnings coming up 2/16, they're expected to crush the estimated earnings. The problem here is of course: ""are the earnings already priced in?"" You know what? Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. CVS fluctuated over $2.50 in price over the last week alone ($71.50 - $74.00). I'm going to dig deep and hit the $75C for 2/19 in hopes of a solid outcome on earnings. Will this happen? I'm going to say yes, BUT I wouldn't expect it to hold. Both Walgreens and CVS stock have been more volatile than usual given the hopes they receive approval as vaccine distribution locations. I'm going to hold the calls in hopes of a solid pop and then dump them all when there are high hopes of a solid close on 2/19.

&#x200B;

* MARA + RIOT
   * I'm going to double down on these two because of the general adaptation occurring throughout large corporations. There is no reason to think this will die off. The limited supply of Voldemort and ""the halvening"" that occurred in the last year will also contribute to a continued rise in Voldemort demand.
   * According to ARK, if companies move ONLY 1% of their free cash into Voldemort, it will rise by $40,000. Now this is a long stretch, but if they moved to 10% of free cash into Voldemort, it would jump by $400,000. This seems unrealistic right now, but 1% is absolutely possible. Multiple companies including Square have already adopted this concept with great success.
   * MARA is successfully moving up this week towards new ATHs. Voldemort will likely continue to rise over the coming year. The play here is obviously not short term returns. The play is holding a company that will be worth 2-3x in the coming years.
   * RIOT is now right back on track with its three month moving average. The volatility here is inevitable given the movements in Voldemort and associated Voldemort infrastructure.

&#x200B;

* CCIV
   * CCIV crushed last week and I'm going to double down on this too because Lucid and CCIV refuse to acknowledge or deny the rumors of their merger/acquisition. If I were a gambling man (I am), I would hold a small stake of CCIV shares as I hold deep OTM calls with a heavy Theta. At a $50 strike, you will pay 10% extra for the 8/20 calls over the May calls. May could be a tight race to guarantee the acquisition is occurring. August gives us a strong theta and will allow it to grow.

2/9/21 03:13,"If you're holding AMC because ""after covid, people will want to go back to the theaters "", you should reconsider. A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change. At best, a bump in traffic when restrictions are lifted then back to losing stock value.

2/9/21 06:58,"The Solution to the Robinhood Problem Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

2/11/21 11:14,"[GME] Volume vs Price Linear Regression Analysis. A comparison with AMC + Others Hey everyone,

I'll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I'll also say I'm NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I've taken Finance courses in college, but that's it. 

In any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here's GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock's page. The tickers I chose are:

* AMC
* ATVI
* GM
* GME
* JPM
* SNDL
* SNOW
* TSLA
* UPS
* V


The criteria was just ""fairly popular stocks"", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you'd want to see, feel free to comment.


I left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.


What I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a ""sign"" of anything. So I'm leaving it up to you apes. [Here's an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You'll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%. 
 Here's a general definition of R^2 : 
>R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.

Here are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):

* AMC: 0.6766
* ATVI: 0.579
* GM: 0.0012
* GME: 0.907
* JPM: 0.6203
* SNDL: 0.3488
* SNOW: 0.0948
* TSLA: 0.7087
* UPS: 0.6852
* V: 0.39


I believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can't help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I've made some ground-breaking discovery, I'm looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current ""reasoning"" for holding is that there's a lot of ""weird"" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as ""maybe it's this, maybe it's that"". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife's bf calls you).

PS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.

2/9/21 19:54,"Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market' Reddit said Monday it raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from both existing and new investors.

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, ""meme stocks"" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.

I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)

For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.

As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.

Hey retards, we are so close to seeing this GME & AMC thing through.

Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.

**This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.**

***How can the report be skewed?*** Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?

You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.

&#x200B;

**HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!** You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.

&#x200B;

What does this mean? Hold, despite what the report says. If the report shows high SI, then the hedgies are actually 100% boned and have not even had enough time and/or money to offset that SI number. That's huge. If the report shows low SI, HODL. The big players simply have not had enough volume to cover all their short positions, and are trying to manipulate us into thinking the MOASS was a hoax.

Not only did the GameStop coalition make some of you brilliant people pay off their student loans, put down payments on houses, and make multiple charitable donations to great causes, but it caused the world to see the flaws in the 'system' and 'the free market'. I'm in my late twenties and I've seen the best this country can't be.

My dad is a salesman. Growing up as a kid in the 90s, he supported me and my three siblings our whole lives. Before the the 2000s, bonuses were spread throughout the company he worked for at the time. If the company did well, if the sales people did a good job for the company they work for, everyone was given a fair bonus in accordance with the profits brought in. This way of comradery (fairness) doesn't seem to exist anymore. We see it as a fantasy that both the CEO and subordinates, that earn the company the real profits, can both profit together.

Everyone involved in the day-to-day labor worked their tails off for the betterment of the company they put the hours in for. All for the wellbeing for them and their families. Both the higher ups and 'underlings' worked in sync with one another for the most part, that being the chairmen of the company and the salespeople/installers that are involved in selling/implementing the product and all prospered from the work being done. 

I am affected by that dream. I am censored by the billionaires/trillionaires that exist today. This trickle down effect where someone can be a literal trillionaire and the people under them are making fractions of those fractions of a salary for them and their families makes me nauseous. I'm tired of witnessing the general public just accepting it for the sign of the times. To be honest, it goes way past accepting it when it comes to the big wigs literally shutting trading down for people like us. People that see the shift in where it should be to where it is now. 

I am fully in support of $GME and I hope the stock goes stratospheric like we all hope it will. But if you cant afford it, stocks like $BB, $PLTR, or $AMC should not be given up on. I guess I would just like to say I care for you and your future gains deeply and lets never give up trying to get back the American Dream that was promised to us after those crazy student loans or incredible debt.

PLTR. Ive been mentioning this one time and time again. I firmly believe in this company. They have a strong leadership team. They are pulling in big contracts and their financials are looking promising. They havent mooned just yet and I am personally invested in this company. However, I am only mentioning this stock for the potential it has. It is a massive analytic software company that can do amazing things. Their software program combines massive data queries into a seamless almost gamelike visual representation easy for the user to comprehend. Yes they had a nice runup recently do to an IBM partnership. I am holding long with stock since it was $18 and i have LEAPS for Jan 2022.

A more risky stock with the potential for a large runup is CLOV.

CLOV is a healthcare provider play. Now why is this a risky play? Well with Biden as president of the USA, he plans to decrease medicare eligible age from 65 to 60, I know thats huge. Currently, each week, there are 10,000 new people eligible for medicare. those are some massive numbers, numbering billions added in revenue for the industry. Chamath is on of the major reason behind this stock. He is a person focused on growth. He assisted Facebook back in the early 2000s and look where they are now. His backing of CLOV will put them in the spotlight especially if there are positive changes to medicare (especially since offfering medicare plans is their specialty). Chamath walks the walk and talks the talk. But as always do your own research. I personally invested stock in this company. and i look forward to see where this goes.

&#x200B;

Look at the big picture everyone! Stay positive and ask lots of questions.

So now what should you do with this information??

2/13/21 04:35,"GIVE ME TENDIES OR GIVE ME DEATH!!! (TSLA Yolo/DD/Bet) I am god damn sick and god damn tired of all these pathetic newbies coming on here and taking away from the authentic WSB culture. Backing out of bets, selling after a dip, saying that we should actually do research before throwing our life savings into a play? It's fucking pathetic, disgraceful. I can hardly even fucking look at you half the time, you should all be ashamed of yourselves.

Every day we stray further from god. What actually brought us to this point? What gave all these degenerates enough capital to lose 10x their inital investment on margin? What first united us as a clan when all the hedgies and stonk brokers said we were going down? What was there before PLTR, GME, SNDL or AMC? Tslsa, Tsla, Tsla, and Tsla. Tesla is the primordial ooze that binds us retards together on the eternal path to tendie town.

To reinvigorate some WSB spirit, I've decided to do what I did last time after [taking a major loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhq2pa/cloudflare_earnings_overnight_play_good_ol/), YOLO the rest of my life savings into TSLA calls and make it all back. By the end of next week I'll be fine dining only the most prestigious tendies on a private jet or my kids will be eating cat food I paid for with a second mortgage on my house. There is no in-between, this is the way. Now for the three-for-one:

# Due Diligence

Tesla literally can not go down next week. It is physically impossible to stray below it's current price point. The timeless syllogism of Tesla is known as modus ponens

Proposition 1: Stonks only go up

Proposition 2: Tsla is a stonk

Conclusion: Tsla only goes up, QED.

I know I've said it before but this literally cannot go tits up. It's like getting in at Gourds before they were a big hit. It's like that one dude who bought a lot of tranches or whatever the fuck before we knew about tranches. It's foolproof. ***Huge upside potential with very little downside.¬†Does that ring a bell?‚Äù***

# Bet

If Tesla closes Friday above $900 I will be getting a Tesla tattoo on my ass cheek.

If Tesla closes Friday above $1000, that tattoo will be the size of a small watermelon.

Don't you dare even insult me by even asking if I'm going to follow through, I am. I'm not like these pussies who fake their bets harder than their wives fake their orgasms. You bet your sweet ass I will follow through.

2/11/21 03:04,"DD: Cinemark ($CNK) ‚Äì Clear Standout in ‚ÄúMoon Stock‚Äù ScreenüöÄüöÄüöÄ First time poster, longtime tard. GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your ‚ÄúHF shill‚Äù comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (‚Ä¶can‚Äôt be sure with half you guys‚Ä¶)

The perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it‚Äôs so obvious it hurts. AMC‚Äôs ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.

This is a rare one-two punch where both the technical & fundamental pictures look great.

**Punchline Upfront:** CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $37.80¬†

# Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)

OK‚Ä¶ Why CNK? Simple: I ran a ‚ÄúMoon Screen‚Äù which looked for:¬†

1. **High Short Interest** (>20% of floatable shares outstanding)
2. **Cheap Stock** (Hasn‚Äôt Had A ‚ÄúGME moment‚Äù, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.)
3. **Small company** with lower trading volume (both mean more upside)
4. **Liquid** (i.e. a lot) **call options** (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (i.e. maximize tendies)¬†

and CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, it‚Äôs because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. That‚Äôs right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it‚Äôs similarity to GME pre-orbit.¬†

# Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)

COVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNK‚Äôs theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.

&#x200B;

# Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World

* TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)

Cinemark‚Äôs theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): ‚Äú\[CNK\] tends to be more suburban, while \[AMC‚Äôs\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro.‚Äù **This is what gets me excited.** While we still don‚Äôt fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:

1. Suburban locations have lower rent
2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs

Just think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be ‚Äúthe only game in town‚Äù in suburbia

In addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemark‚Äôs customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:

1. More price sensitive customers => less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home => more likely to continue going to the theater

# Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet => Longer Runway to Weather ‚ÄúCOVID Storm‚Äù

* TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID

Strong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at 8.5x).¬†

Industry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins; 8.6% ‚Äúfatter‚Äù (i.e. good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)

Low rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.

# Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness

25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think)¬†

&#x200B;

**Valuation/\*Nerd Shit\*:**

* Has traded historically at 6.5-8.5x fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 8.5x as recently as a few years ago¬†
* Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.
* EBITDA was \~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at¬†700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first ‚Äúnormal‚Äù year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple, 6.5x, gives me a price of $38.50 (after dividing by shares outstanding)

**Target Price: $38.50**

&#x200B;

**Afterthought ‚Äì Takeout Upside:**

* Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?
* Just as restaurants won‚Äôt go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second
* As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand
* A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services

&#x200B;

**Notes/Links:**

**Sean Gamble** \- *Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer*

>""And in terms of our overlap, it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance. In general, it's pretty small, I would say, estimate less than 20%. You just consider our market shares, that can kind of show that it's only a small portion in. **We generally tend to be more suburban, while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro**. So it's a limited overlap.""

# What is Yandex?

Yandex is a multinational corporation that operates primarily in Russia, Europe and ex-Soviet bloc offering a wide range of services. Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine, taxi services and other segments. Currently they offer more than 70 services (Streaming subscriptions like Netflix, Yandex.Music like Spotify, Classifieds ads, self-managed subscriptions for ad campaigns, self driving cars, deliveries, marketplace and a fuck ton more)

As you can see Yandex has been seeing consistent revenue growth since 2017. Recently, its delivery service has begun turning a profit and is widely used among the citizens of Russia.

Read that again. **A Taxi/food delivery service is turning a profit.** That is a big accomplishment. Have you seen Uber or DoorDash turn a profit?

This is their free cash flow from previous 3 years and TTM. You always want to see a positive cash flow to ensure that companies have enough liquidity to stay afloat and keep them from issuing new shares to raise capital. Spikes in cash flow from growth companies is not uncommon, it is mainly due to usual acquisitions, restructuring, re-investments made. Current outstanding shares: \~345m

# Now, on to some of their services.

This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend. (Don't yo, this is a long term play)

**Yandex.Lavka**

1. Grocery delivery within 5-12 min is the goal. Some sites are achieving this already
2. Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s. Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process.
3. Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery (think Amazon Prime Now)
4. In order to reduce costs, additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built.
5. Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked
6. Yandex Rover is making deliveries (actively) in three different locations. Currently a test but with the goal of going 100% driverless for deliveries and reduce costs.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Market**

1. Their current primary growth segment. They've recently acquired Sberbank's stake (Russia's most influential and one of largest banks) and now own 100% of market. Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as [Ozon.ru](https://Ozon.ru)
2. They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones. Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer (cliche, but think Amazon)

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Go**

1. Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers (stuff ranging from documents to pianos)
2. More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders
3. ""Delivery with a click"" which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas (think Amazon locker). Delivery goals are to be within 15 min.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Cloud**

Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies. Main competition Amazon AWS

**Yandex.Maps**

Same as above. Main competitor Google Maps

**Alice**

Yandex's dedicated AI. Currently has 45+m users, mainly in speakers, navigation, Yandex App

**Yandex.Search**

Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues.

1. What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that **while search engine revenues kept increasing, their TAC (traffic acquisition costs, the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them) is decreasing.** What does this mean? It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium. **Think**, why the fuck unless you're a boomer would you go to google, search for 'amazon' when you can go to amazon directly? This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads.
2. TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16% while total ad revenues grew by 1%. Read that again god damn it. **They're paying 16% less while maintaining their ad revenues, their biggest segment!**

**Yandex Self Driving Group**

Yo. This shit. Is. Legit.

Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow. Dirt, snow, murky (or none at all) traffic lanes, chaotic drivers, alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another -1.5% hit on his portfolio. And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input.

They currently have logged over 5.5 million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv, Michigan and Moscow. That is a big fucking deal. They also have a partnership with Hyundai.

**However**, coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving. This means it will take several years for perfection, whos to say sales cant happen before that?

# Other stuff

They sponsor educational camps and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia (Physics, mathematics, engineering) and they continue to choose talent from these areas. This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US/Europe to develop their products

They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience. I am telling you, Russians (especially those born in Soviet era) is TOUGH to accept technology. And yet they've done it by Yandex.taxi and Yandex.Lavka .

I'm kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now, I feel like we're running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks.

Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020. Don't ever take this as a tell-tale sign to buy, but rather as one part to consider

# Gay Bear cases (in this case I am also a gay bear)

Russia is not stable politically - things can be done under the table.

* True, fair risk. But more or less the same thing in US except it's official (lobbying, insider trading, congress hearings that are just a facade)

They're too over-extended in their segments. They're focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well.

* I would be concerned about this if their cash flow, revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY. However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing. Also, think about it more simply - if they have these specialists working on all these segments, they can easily sell them off for a profit. Yandex.Pay was a cashless payment system that was 100% sold off to Sberbank. It is something that Yandex created and then re-invested those proceedings to their different ventures like Yandex.Market

What else you got? I am legitimately interested as my overconfident ass has 50% of his portfolio in this.

Like my hero DFV, my bread and butter is to invest in extremely undervalued value companies in this frothy market environment with vix spikes happening every few days. If you follow DFV and watch his vids, you'll know that he bought GME for its value, and the gamma/short squeeze was icing.


This might be a long post, so skip to TLDR if you don't care about market logic. To begin, why is the #1 wholesale & purchase mortgage lender in USA so cheap you might ask? Well, I can't give you any one particular reason, but GHIV was one of the biggest spacs merger ever, and it might have suffered from the a spac speculative life cycle, and the shorts are in control, and oh boy, are they in control.

But no, their financials and balance sheet are immaculate, and they absolutely smashed earnings, originating 54.7B in loan volume, up 71% y/y, with a 4th qtr net income of  $1.37B vs. 108.72M (that's billion vs. million) in the same qtr last year,  and FY20 net income of  $3.38B, an **821%** and **715%** increase over 4Q19 and FY19, respectively.


Also, during the earnings call, they declared a dividend of $.40/yr, as of today's price, this is a **4.5% div. yield** with ex. div date on 3/9. Their EBITDA growth has outpaced their top line revenue growth, which signifies a margin expansion. They are getting more profitable every year, with good guidance on their call. Their forward P/E was 6.21 this morning, compared to that of RKT at $10.94. UWMC should be at a good value of around **$16.5** if we use RKT as a fair comp, although I would argue that RKT is slightly undervalued as well.


**Short Interest:**

As of yesterday, it had a short interest of **36.2%** with only 50k shares available to short at a 7.9% fee. When I tried to short 1 share on IBKR this morning, there were none available. I don't normally pick stocks based on short interest, but like DFV, this is an added icing for a major squeeze. It also has a short ratio of about 1.6, so it'll take at least 1.6 days for shorts to cover if there is a day of pure buys. The higher the ratio means more covering with higher volume spikes, which brings in more buyers.

**Gamma Strip:**

The option flow on this is absolutely bonkers with 45k calls and 2k puts, there are gargantuan gamma ramps at 10, 12.5, 15, and 17, with $15 being the largest at every expiry. Once volume picks up and people realize how undervalued this stock is, it will quickly ramp to 15 via MM's delta hedging.


**Ownership:**

This is 34% instutionally owned with Phoenix Holding buying 2.5M shares today, making them 5.88% owners of the company. After today's buy, I would expect that institutionally owned number to reach 40%.


**Max Pain:**

I posted a DD on PCG a while ago and I rode it up from $8.50 to $13, so I understand how these stocks are artificially suppressed. PCG had a larger institutional ownership at around 80%, and it was curious to me how every opex date ended right around max pain. So even if that were the case here, max pain is at $10 on Feb 19, with the next lower strike ($7.5) losing 184.72% of contract value vs the next higher strike ($12.5) losing only 59.839%. I am fairly confident this will be above $10 by then.

**TA:**

UWMC is at the bottom of a channel with a lot of support from hfs buying anything below today. It is trading very near their book/NAV, and I think today's Phoenix 2.5m, a new 5.88% position will get some eyes on this gem. I have no doubt it will run up for ex-div date as well. There is bullish divergence and I see volume coming in the next few days. My personal price target is at $25-$30 within a year, and this constitutes as a long term hold for me.


**Tech:**
One of the things I like the most is their mobile app that gives independent brokers the ability to underwrite a loan from open to close, their companion app can pull credit reports, get e-sigs, and act as a point of sale and loan origination system. If they make it user assessible to retail clients, like how they do it in Asia with BEKE, I can see a big bottom-line bonus here.

I'm not one for surprises so I put it right up there in the title as a big FU to all those betting against AMC right now.

I'd like to make something abundantly clear. AMC is is not going anywhere. Not only will they weather this storm and come out on top but there are companies like Sony and Columbia that are *banking on* the existence of a Box Office to recoup their investments in silver screen flix. I guarantee that right now there is Peter Venkman merchandise already sitting in warehouses waiting to hit the market (and likely gamestop stores, lol).

Now I'm not goig to sit here and do your research about Thanksgiving release date movies and Christmas etc... but you can bet that the entire movie industry is looking for COVID to be over just as much as the travel industry who's buying up island destination properties.

For everyone and anyone who's negative with AMC I'm wondering why on earth they'd take a loss versus waiting till the summer when this stock will easily exceed $20/share (IMHO of course). I see no reason to concede shares back to those who shorted them simply on principle.

If you'd like to do your own research about AMCs financials I suggest posts like [this one][https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lctc6u/i_cant_believe_how_many_people_are_more_retarted/]. While I can seem to find it, someone here had stats on what AMC makes off of MoviePass alone. Let's not let the media con us here.

2/11/21 15:01,"Wed AM Gamma Analysis & Trading Day Retrospective on GME, TLRY, APHA, SNDL, CRSR, AMC Below is a dump of a bunch of popular tickers. Some don't have spotgamma data, but all have tradingvolatility data. This data is a bit stale - it's Wednesday AM data, so whatever happened today changed it in terms of option open interest.

[https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz](https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz)

**How to interpret:**

Whenever there is call or put open interest, it COULD BE options dealers are net sellers. Whatever the net 'short gamma' (total net options sold) by dealers will in turn result in gamma hedging as the price of the stock moves past. This generally means that dealers buy if the price going up, and sell if price going down, regardless of if they have short puts or short calls on the books. This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve ""Stevie"" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened.

Delta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.

Because this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:

AMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)

CRSR: 88.1m shares

SNDL:435m shares

APHA:312m shares

TLRY: 137m shares

GME: 70m shares

In my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.

Today, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.

**Edit: Thursday 2:20pm EST analysis:**

All stocks at the end of the day require NET BUYERS to go up.  My interpretation with the broad collapse of 420 stocks is just that people took profits/not enough new buyers. The gamma ramps that can shoot stocks up ALSO can shoot them down if you run out of buyers and go to net selling. That appears to be what is happening. That also means if there are inflows they can shoot back up though.

**Brief analysis:**

**GME**: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.

**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being ""The"" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did, and we can in turn expect a spectacular pop when people get distracted and move on to the new shiney. Be cautious! I'll do more TLRY bubble analysis below.

**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying.

**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isn‚Äôt accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I don‚Äôt expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.

**CRSR**: This isn‚Äôt actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. It‚Äôs right in the middle of a decent sized gamma ramp, so buying will send it up somewhat faster ‚Äì and selling will send it down somewhat faster. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result.

**AMC**: I‚Äôm not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float ‚Äì this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR.

&#x200B;

**TLRY Bubble Analysis**

Tilray long ago on about 75m shares got to $180 in a bubble, and that popped a little without insider lockup... when lockup happened it killed a new surge in jan 2019, sending it down a bit to $70.  We are now at 130m shares outstanding.  That means the shares outstanding went up 73%, and float probably is up a bit more post-lockup, so let's call it 80%. 70 bucks divided by 1.8 is $40, which represents similar mini-bubble prices, which we are over. Therefore, while I think this can and probably will go higher, I don't think we are going to hit the $180 easily. We might see $100 or $120. But I think this is starting to get into heavy lift territory.  Another view would be to see that GME was about $10b-$15b of retail money in, and TLRY market cap is $8b already.  If I think GME was max retail money in, maybe TLRY can get half of that. That puts a barrier on it getting past the low to mid 100s in my opinion. My advice is - this looks like it's beginning to be a bubble - best practice in a bubble is to not get greedy, and take profits as you go. Bubbles pop when new money in slows. I personally don't trade them because they are my worst trading skill. Good luck!

**Vulture Strategy**

Whenever everyone is FOMOing hard over these stocks, they tend to dump prior favorites to buy - stuff like NFLX, TSLA, whatever the last memes were, random banned stocks here that we also watch. Some of those favorites are quality stocks, and others are the next meme next week that aren't yet in the limelight. If you have long-standing S&P500 or Nasdaq-100 stocks that are down for no real reason big tomorrow (and today), or a meme favorite, you may just want to snag some shares cheap if you aren't feeling these stocks. May see some more flash sales.

*My positions: I own none of these!  But I'm long the market, and you guys dumping your winners to buy TLRY and similar is I think why NDX took a dump this morning, and that kind of hurt. Fortunately I did hold, and did buy the dip, and did buy TSLA calls. Which I'll regret because you'll probably sell more TSLA to buy more TLRY tomorrow. I intend to enter into positions on none of these, because I'm a square.*

Because we got invaded by r/investing I'm supposed to say this isn't financial advice or investment advice, and it sure as hell isn't either of those!

If you want to go to mars you will likely first install some base facilities on the moon to prepare your starships for mars. This is a possible playbook to go to mars.   

At the moment it seems like there is some kind of a standoff situation between institutional shorts and longs.

Most of you probably noticed a tweet from an investment company saying: Stay the course? At the same time they heavily increased their positions in AMC.

GME on the other side left a lot of burned ground and is in special interest now because of the hearing and such. So you probably should not try to take this rocket to the moon for the moment. But some say it already made it to the moon, so perhaps it just needs some refueling to become a starship further explore our solar system?

However, if you are an institutional investor you have to think strategic, right? Here is the big what if:

WHAT IF, you are an institutional investor and decide you want to go to mars but need to refuel the rocket on the moon in between. The main problems in GME at the moment are: the burned ground, insecurities of shareholders and the lost momentum of retail buyers. But what if you target another rocket (AMC) first. To overcome the low momentum in GME you need a new story. Now you tweet some cryptic related shit to draw some attention. The same day you publish your new increased positions in AMC. There is much less attention on AMC in comparison to GME right now, so this would probably be the easier game. If you team up with some of your institutional buddies you are maybe able to trigger a squeeze in AMC. There you go! First part successfully completed. AMC rocket on the moon.

There is your new story! If a lot of retail can participate in the squeeze, YOU are the new story. Now there is a bunch of retards pumped with cash sitting on the moon. They will definitely watch you jumping into the rocket RobinHood parked there for you. Now you have a lot of new cash and a temporary fan base of apes. Next you start buying GME, probably OTC and file it to the SEC. Retail would definitely notice even without any extra tweets and jump in. There you have it. Momentum is back and the starship is ready to go to mars.

This is no financial advice. How could it? It‚Äôs a scenario of the conquering of our solar system.

Are you down thousands of dollars on GME, AMC, BB, or other meme stocks you got from WSB*? ALL you have to do is just cut your losses so that you can get tax-loss benefits and offset your gains. That‚Äôs it. Just sell at a loss.

$TRVG is now back above $1bn market cap. It was worth nearly 3x as much a year ago.

Expedia is the majority shareholder in the company, so it's definitely not going to disappear.

This quarter the company announced that they managed to cut expenses by 71% versus 2019, bringing their overall cash burn down to about 10 million dollars.

They're sitting on about 250-300 million in cash on hand, so that's enough for them to last **5 years** with out having to grow sales at all. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

They're a MUCH leaner business than they were coming into the pandemic, and they'll be primed to benefit once sales start to increase coming out of this. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

They aren't an Airline with billions of dollars in planes sitting on the ground, so they'll be able to pivot into profitability very quickly. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

The ""Worst case"" scenario here is that Expedia buys out the remaining shares. If this were to happen, they won't be buying them back for less than 6-8$.

Shares have been trending upwards since they announced earnings earlier this week.

Call premiums are pricing in IV of 200%+, so this is definitely a play where you buy shares.

At the current valuation, we're getting to buy a company that normally generates a billion dollars in revenues for a cash adjusted price of $800 mil

Even more beautiful, the majority of their revenues were previously generated by companies Expedia owns. Booking holdings (Expedia's competitor) has been increasing the amount of business they've been sending to Trivago and as a % of business, Booking holdings has been referring more in 2020 vs 2019.

Liability note: I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD. This is a stock I like a LOT

TLDR: Trivago's biggest client is Expedia group, Trivago's biggest shareholder is Expedia. Booking holdings, Expedia's competitor has been sending $TRVG more business. Costs are down 71% year over year, so a ""new"" leaner company coming out of the pandemic, with LOTS of pent-up travel demand. Shares are cheap, but won't be for long. In the time I typed this up, they rose from $2.80 to just under 3$.

Butterfly Network & Longview Acquisition have now merged through a SPAC deal and came onto the market on Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2021 (Which is today at the time of writing). On Friday (Feb. 12, 2021) there was a shareholders meeting to announce the results of a stockholders' vote which had been occurring for the past month. Since BFLY is now trading in the market, the shareholder obviously approved it, not to mention a near 100% shareholder approval for the vote. -  [PR Newswire- BFLY Article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/longview-acquisition-corp-stockholders-approve-business-combination-with-butterfly-network-inc-301227602.html)

As seen in the image above, BFLY is currently trading around 22-23 dollars which is a slight drop from its premerger price of 23.05. Butterfly Network's merger is valued at 1.5 Billion dollars and as you see the current market cap is around 1B, this means it is somewhat undervalued as it's supposed to be 1.5 Billion. Although it isn't significantly undervalued, every bit of value counts and is also a bonus.

If you've been investing during 2020, you might have noticed that SPACs and IPOs have been on fire, with Airbnb (ABNB) recently coming to the market with over DOUBLE its valuation due to the hype. I predict this same effect can happen to Butterfly Network. üìà üöÄ

2/17/21 03:22,"$BB Thoughts - Feb. 16, 2021  A few thoughts on the red this morning and collective hand wringing. While \~5% isn't a big dip (put on your big boy pants - It's really not), if you're like me and hold calls you're absolutely feeling the pain.

\#1 - We were optimistic that $BB had decoupled from the meme stocks, but it's unclear that that's fully the case. [Algorithmic / high-frequency trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc0oof/part_4_bb_no_meems_plus_gme_amc_nok_ties_that_bind/) can exacerbate sell-offs of particular baskets (and vice versa). Taken separately, one can see reasons for a dip for certain meme tickers but as of this writing every single WSB ticker of recent memory (NOK, AMC, GME, etc.) is down against a broader index that is green

\#2 - Oddly, the cynical here tend to be the naive. Do not succumb to the tin foil-itis. Short ladders generally don't exist. Hedge funds like to make money when stocks go up (or down) - They are not a monolith. The harsh truth is - The market is brutal and indifferent. Nobody's out to get you, because nobody cares. You make money or lose money by the dint of your ability and luck. And don't forget the luck.

\#3 - Newbie investors keep asking ""what to do"". If you are an investor rather than a trader (and there is a BIG difference) - There is only one question that matters, period. It's the question that should have driven your thinking about the stock when you bought it and when you decide to sell, and it's the question you should have in mind when you read the [news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-jarvis-named-best-breed-160000731.html).

**A look at their** [**10-Q**](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm)

Let‚Äôs start with a look at their financial standing as of the end of September 2020. Obviously, a lot of things have happened since then and we‚Äôll get to that later, but let‚Äôs first take a look at what their latest available financial position was to see how bad it was getting. Going through their 10-Q, here‚Äôs some of their Q3 highlights

* Income Statement
   * Revenue - 120M (-85% YoY)
   * Operating Expenses - 795M (-39% YoY)
   * Net Loss - 906M
* Balance Sheet
   * Cash & Equivalents - 418M
   * Current Assets - 609M
   * Total Assets - 10.9B
   * Current Liabilities - 1.59B
   * Total Liabilities - 13.2B
   * Total Equity (Deficit)  - (2.3B) deficit vs 1.2B equity in Q3 2019
* Cash Flows
   * Operations - (772M)
   * Investing - (155M)
   * Financing - 1.08B
      * Raised over 1B cash from senior bond issuances
   * Net Cash Increase - 153M
* Notes & Forward Guidance
   * Refinanced 87% of outstanding bonds for bonds due 2026 for higher-interest bonds w/ a principal reduction of 555M
   * Lenders have given relief from maintenance covenants in their bonds temporarily. Will need to increase cash flow or EBITDA back to a sufficient level by the end of March, when the relief ends, to be in compliance with the covenants or else the bondholders can make the bonds payable / due immediately, unless lenders agree to extend it
   * Cash burn = 388M during Q3
   * Expects rent to be drastically increased starting in 2021 due to expiration of rent deferrals
   * 600M in convertible debt to Silver Lake
   * (335M) EBITDA in Q3
   * **Expected to run out of cash by the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, will require a sudden source of liquidity or increase in theatre attendance to not go bankrupt.**

**Recent Events**

The last point can basically sum up the important part of the 10-Q; that they‚Äôve basically exhausted all possible sources of liquidity, and they would have most likely gone bankrupt some time early in 2021. They have a massive net deficit of 2.3B, which means that it would have been extremely likely that the shareholders would have been left with nothing in the case of bankruptcy. Even if their liquidity issues weren‚Äôt going to immediately force them to bankruptcy, their inability to meet their debt covenants when they expire at the end of March would have likely put them in default if lenders gave up hope and started cutting their losses.

All of this meant that literally every hedge fund analyst looking at this would have recommended their fund go short on AMC, since it seemed obvious that they were about to go bankrupt - the management even stated this in their most recent financial statements; this is why AMC ended up with a 39M / 57M of the float short (69% SI) at the end of 2020 - it seemed like the most obvious thing in the world, and AMC bottomed out at $1.91 when all seemed lost and the intrinsic value of the stock was $0 in every analyst‚Äôs mind.

Except, [as I‚Äôve learned last year the hard way](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h945ly/dddd_retail_investors_bankruptcies_dark_pools_and/), even if all the fundamentals and financials point to an obvious bankruptcy is coming in the near term, it‚Äôs been a weird year and anything can happen. Specifically

1. [Silver Lake converted all of their $600M of debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-to-issue-444-million-shares-as-investors-opt-to-convert-600-million-of-convertible-debt-2021-01-28) to 44M shares during the AMC spike
2. It raised $917M in cash from debt and equity (165M shares issued)

Assuming the cash burn remained the same levels as Q3, which is the worst case scenario as states are much more likely to relax restrictions this year with vaccinations rolling out, this cash should last them all the way into Q4 2021. This also makes it much more likely that debt holders would extend their debt covenant waiver now that imminent bankruptcy is off the table. r/wallstreetbets **had effectively saved AMC from bankruptcy**.

**AMC Today**

With this background, there‚Äôs two mispricings that lends itself to a high-probability play.

1. As of Feb 12, AMC was at $5.59, which is barely double the share price of it back when they seemed to be approaching near-certain imminent bankruptcy in a few weeks
2. The Implied Volatility of put options are still extremely high based on the recent price action

Here‚Äôs some examples of the prices and IV of put options for AMC

[Feb 19 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/wkm8nscusuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bc0f459ac9d0a5c14587fe72733c727934c5c1)

Furthermore, [as of 1/29 data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC), there‚Äôs still 38M shares short, meaning that not that many funds that were actually shorting AMC actually covered yet. Of course, because AMC was printing new shares like they‚Äôre JPowell to print themselves out of bankruptcy, the short interest went down to 15% of float, meaning it‚Äôll be very unlikely to see another short squeeze.

**Thesis**

1. The stock is fundamentally undervalued at a market cap of $1.9B and share value of $5.50 (based on historical pricing; anyone doing an actual DCF analysis would say the equity is worth negative dollars because debt > EV). They were last at this price in late September, when there was uncertainty of their ability to survive another wave of lockdowns, and was $4.50 at late November, literally a month before they stated in their 10Q that they‚Äôve already released that they would run out of cash and go bankrupt. Compared to this, it makes no sense for this stock to still be at $5.50 now that it‚Äôs extremely likely that AMC will not go bankrupt.
2. The Implied Volatility on the put side is insanely high, especially if you consider that AMC is likely undervalued, and hedge funds probably aren‚Äôt going to be adding additional shorts of AMC at this price, especially after seeing what happened to it a few weeks ago.

**The Play**

To take advantage of the mispricings, I‚Äôve been short (i.e. write / sold) cash-covered puts on AMC on $5 and $6 strike prices for Feb, Mar, and Apr expiries since last week. Theta decay and a decreasing IV has caused the prices of these puts to go down substantially, but imo they‚Äôre still ridiculously overpriced. For example, to lose money on selling $5.50 puts expiring in a few days, AMC will need to go down to $5.15 (almost 10%). For March and April ATM puts, AMC would need to go below $4.50 to lose money, which is below the share price of AMC when bankruptcy was imminent. And if AMC stays above $5.50 by that time, you‚Äôd be making a healthy 21% return in 1 month.",33390,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.83302474,True

2/16/21 20:47,"Dear Noobs: how you could have anticipated the crash of GME and not lost 80% I'm not saying that this is guaranteed to have predicted this outcome, however I am saying that the following information would have set alarms off in the minds of experienced traders.

The concept of ""Depth of Market"" is crucial in my view. Completely new traders probably will not know what this is.

Limit orders are placed for buying and selling, and they sit there, providing possible liquidity until a matching order is made, either a limit order or market order. This is basically the depth of market.

For example, if I place a limit buy order at $5, but there are no existing sell limit orders at $5, then my limit order will sit there until a matching order at $5 comes along to sell me that share at $5.

Let's say there are buy limit orders for a quantity of a billion shares at $5, which have not been filled due to a lack of sellers at that price. In order for the price to go below $5, those billion buy limit orders would need to be filled before the buy limit orders below that would be filled, effectively, because usually people that are looking to sell aren't looking to sell at a lower price than what they could get, realistically.

So, if that is true, then it would make sense that all of those buy limit orders are sort of a wall that makes it harder for the price to drop.

If you take away the ability for investors to place those buy limit orders that support the price when it falls - stopping it from falling much further and then possibly reversing back up, then you literally remove all reason for the price to sustain its level, because eventually the buy limit orders will become exhausted, no new orders being allowed, and the aggressive sellers will walk right through to lower and lower prices.

In the previous example, if instead of a billion shares worth of buy limit orders at $5, it were 3 shares worth of buy limit orders at $5, it would be far easier for the price to drop in the latter case than the former, because those 3 shares worth of buy limit orders at $5 are easier to deplete and then move to the buy limit orders at a lower price, such as $4.99

This explains roughly what happened when the brokers removed the ability to buy GME and AMC, they virtually ensured a lower quantity of buy limit orders, and therefore weakened the support that the market had to support its price level, dramatically.

An experienced trader who knows about depth of market, and now you too, would likely have pondered the likelihood of a far weaker support for the price level, and expected a reversal.",33407,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.93283987,True

*don't know why my screenshot doesn't show on reddit, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/2YvrkR0 

&#x200B;

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

*again, the chart I uploaded to reddit doesn't show up on my end, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/VwK58BR 

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)

* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

&#x200B;

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

*The image I uploaded may not show up. Another link:*  https://imgur.com/WARXMTh 

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&#x200B;

*The original image uploaded doesn't seem to show up, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/Gx9Ded6 

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

&#x200B;

\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments.

\###I'm also planning on buying some calls if IV goes down a bit

\###I won't be doing another AMC DD for a few days at least, maybe after 2/25 when ER happens.

2/16/21 03:26,"Thoughts on Stonks: A rendition of George Carlin **# of times mods have taken this down so far: 1**

A tribute to George Carlin's thoughts on germs (stonks) in America.

&#x200B;

They can fuck with you anytime they want. As long as you put up with it which means of course anytime they want because that's what Americans do now. They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling--the *illusion* of security. What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and stonks.

There's another thing: stonks.

&#x200B;

Where did this sudden fear of stonks comes from in this country? Have you noticed this? The media constantly running stories about all the latest stonks. Tesla, Hertz, AMC, Gamestop. And Americans they panic easily so now everybody is running around buying this and selling that and cutting their gains short and repeatedly listening to the news to avoid all contact with stonks.

It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths. In prisons before they give you a lethal injection they ask if you want to sell your GME. That's true.

Well they don't want you to lose any more money. And you can see their point. Wouldn't want some guy to go to hell and be poor. Would take a lot of the sportsmanship out of the whole execution.

Fear of stonks...why these fucking pussies. You can't even find a decent YOLO anymore. They FUD the shit out of everything now and everybody's afraid of losing.

Hey where's your sense of adventure? Take a fucking chance will you? You know how many people lose all their tendies every year? 9,000 that's all. It's a minor risk! Take a fucking chance bunch of goddamn pussies.

Besides what do you think you have diamond hands for? They're for holding stonks! But they need practice. They need stonks to practice on.

So listen, if you ignore all the stonks around you and live a completely sterile life then when the FUD comes after whatever you're holding you won't be prepared. And never mind ordinary FUD. What are you going to do when some super virus FUD comes along that turns your portfolio into liquid shit? I'll tell you what you're going to do--you're going to panic and you're going to sell at a loss. And you're going to deserve it because you're fucking weak and you‚Äôve got fucking weak paper hands.

Alright, let me tell you a true story about the stock market okay. When I was a little boy in New York City we gambled everything we had on pennystocks that were going bankrupt. Okay? We spun the roulette wheel and put it all on 21, you know just because? And at that time the big fear was a market crash. Thousands of kids lost their tendies to market crashes. But you know something? In my neighborhood no one ever lost anything to a market crash. NO ONE! EVER! You know why? because we YOLOED ON PENNYSTOCKS. It strengthened our diamond hands; the market never had a prayer! We were tempered in raw FUD!

So, personally I never take any special precautions against stonks.

I don't shy away from people who spread fear and uncertainty.

I don't listen to anything on TV.

I don't listen to friends or family.

I don't take advice from billionaries.

And if one of my stonks drops 50% I double down and buy more of it. Even if the company is just a sidewalk cafe in *Calcutta*. The *poor* section. On New Year's morning during a soccer riot.

And you know something? In spite of all that so-called risky behavior...I never have losses.

I don't get them.

I don't get paper-hands.

I don't get FOMO.

I don't get stressed.

I don't buy into FUD.

You know why? Because I got good strong diamond hands and they get a lot of practice.

My diamond hands are equipped with SEC company updates, google trend indicators, and HQ sentiment analysis. And we have recently acquired positive EMA, daily supertrend, VWAP, and MACD. So when my BUY buttons are on patrol reconnoitering the market seeking out bankrupt companies and other undesirables...if they see any, ANY suspicious-looking stonks of any kind they don't fuck around. They whip out the DD, they buy the motherfucker, and deposit the unlucky stonk directly into my portfolio. Into my portfolio. There's no nonsense. There's no Miranda warning. There's none of that three strikes and you're out bullshit. First offense BAM into the portfolio ya go.

Oh and speaking of my portfolio I want you to know I don't automatically downsize a stock once its taking up a large % of my portfolio. Okay? Can you deal with that? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. You know when sell my stonks? When I have to buy other stonks! That's the only time. And you know how often that happens? Tops TOPS...two maybe three times a week TOPS. Maybe a little more frequently before the holidays you know what I mean?

And I'll tell you something else my paper-handed friends. You don't always need to trade every day. Did you know that? It's overkill. Unless you work at a firm, or have 10 monitors at your disposal, or for some reason come in intimate contact with huge amounts of FUD and FOMO every day... you don't always need to trade.

I appreciate it thank you.

Disclaimer: None of the following is investment advice. Do your own research.

There's a lot of chatter about AMC and whether it'll pop or it'll dive. This is an attempt to establish the facts and figure out what's the roadmap to tendies from here on.

**tl;dr for those on a multicoloured crayon diet:**

**AMC is not dead, nor will it die anytime soon. There's plenty of positive catalysts coming up.**

**If you want to get in this play right away then better buy shares because IV is very high at the moment. $5 seems like a price floor. If you do want to buy calls I suggest Aug expiry between $7-$9, or better yet LEAPS Jan 22 at $10-$12.**

**My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40. I'm waiting for IV to drop a bit before I buy LEAPS.**

Let's start at the beginning:

AMC is the largest movies operator in the world. It has 1,004 theatres and 11,041 screens worldwide. The biggest, by far. They made $43bn revenue for movie studios in 2019.

What we know from the Q3 2020 results:

After 5 months suspension of Operations theatres started to reopen.

First domestic theatres reopened 8/20 and int'l ones as early as June. However, most of Europe has been in lockdown since Nov/Dec 2020 and all domestics operate on a 20%-40% limited capacity. As of Oct 30th it operated 539/600 domestic locations and 261/358 int'l locations.

Record high scores in cleanliness of theatres.

March 2020 raised $900m in debt and equity. $1bn concessions from creditors and landlords, $80m asset sales.

* Q1 of 2020: drew down $325m from existing credit lines
* April 2020: issued $500m of debt due 2025. Suspended cash repurchase and dividends. Received $7m in tax cash refunds
* July 2020: debt exchange reduced debt by $555m, reduced interest expenses by $120m for one year (up to July 2022), extended maturities on $1.7bn of debt until 2026 and issued $300m of new debt due 2026.
* August 2020: sold Baltic region theatres for $77m.
* Sept 2020: sold 15m shares for $56.1m.
* Oct 2020: sold another 15m shares for $41.6m.
* Dec 2020: Prepared 50m shares for issuance, should they need to. Total shares outstanding on Dec 28 2020 were 164m Class A and 51.8m Class B.
* Jan 2021: Total shares outstanding as of Jan 22 2021 were 287,276,58 Class A and 51.8m Class B (Class B can't be sold unless converted to Class A).
* Jan 27th: SLA converts debt into equity and sells $600m worth of shares in the market. Total shares added to float: 44.4m. Debt reduced by $600m
* Feb 5th 2020: Wanda converted it's class B shares to class A shares. This means they can sell them in the market at any time now. There is no specific # on how many shares it converted, but we know it owned 51.8m of Class B shares.

Operationally they proceeded with layoffs and a series of cost cutting measures, renegotiated theatre leases, eliminate contractor roles and all sorts of expenses. **This is important as these savings will persist throughout the reopening of the theatres, so they will improve their profit margins going forward.**

**Cash position on 9/30: $417.9m**

**Total debt on 9/30: $5.82bn**

**Q&A with myself**

**Are people really returning to theatres?**

Attendance was 6.5m tickets in Q3 2020 vs 87.1m in Q3 2019, representing about 7.5% of seating capacity, which was limited to about 20%-40% of total seats. While this may look like they are not utilizing their existing seating capacity, remember that theatre ops in USA were suspended for 2/3 of the 3rd quarter. I am guessing (no data) a similar restriction at the international theatres. Had ops not been suspended for 2/3 of Q3 then we'd be seeing roughly 3x the tickets, about 19.5m, or 22% of total seating capacity. That would suggest people were returning to cinemas before the end of Sept 2020. That's despite no blockbusters playing. **Only 2 films were released theatrically since mid-March to end of Sept and theatres were open mostly on weekends, so there wasn't much to watch anyway.**

**Are people spending at the theatres?**

Average ticket prices in Q3 2020 were $9.37 VS. $9.45 in Q3 2019, so pretty much the same.

In Int'l markets ticket prices were actually higher, at $9.80 vs $8.45.

Spending on food and beverage was the same in USA, at $5.35/patron in both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019, and higher in int'l markets ($4.10/patron vs. $3.59/patron in Q3 2019)

Again, that's positive in relation to how customers feel about AMC managing the cleaning of its theatres and safety practices. That level of spending suggests people are comfortable watching movies and eating/drinking in the theatres.

**From the Q3 ER call:**

The critical movie-leading markets of Los Angeles and New York City remain closed.

There has been massive focus on improving liquidity and deleveraging the balance sheet and cutting costs and spending. **A lot of those cost saving and spending cuts will continue even after revenue recovers,** which means higher profit margins, which means higher EPS, which means lower multiples to comps, which means share price will go up as it will be perceived as 'cheap'.

Stroke a deal with Universal for a PVOD window. Basically, that means that AMC will not exclusive rights to play movies for 74 days at theatres before the movie can go on video-on-demand. The time window is shortened, and after that you will have movies both on theatres and on demand online at the same time. AMC will take a cut for any movies that go on PVOD before the theatrical release period ends. As they said later in November, they have made more money with the PVOD deal than the standard exclusive theatrical release.

Theatre count in Middle East tripled in 2020, and it will further double in the first half of 2021.

Cash burn for Q3 2020 was $324m, inclusive of the costs for raising capital.

**44 major film titles have been rescheduled to play theatrically only in 2021. Once theatres reopen, say in summer, there will be a blockbuster every single week and some more.**

They have gotten out of 40 loss-making theatres in USA as well by not renewing leases.

**Breaking even?**

In 2019 AMC sold 17% of their available seats and had the biggest revenue/profit of any year ever. It all hinges to NYC and LA reopening basically as other individual theatres break even at 25% capacity. What this means is that you don't need COVID restrictions to lift fully before AMC starts making profits, you only need LA and NYC to reopen. This makes AMC a bit of a dark horse because most people will be waiting for full economy reopen before they jump at the stock, but its financials will be in the black long before then, and that means that it will most likely surprise upwards on ER going forward and exceed wallstreet's expectations.

**Innovation. Ok, they will reopen, but will they grow?**

They have launched a private theatre rental program, where you can book the whole auditorium. They have had 80,000 incquiries about it, and that's with a soft launch (no press releases yet or advertising).

There have been a lot of articles in the second half of 2020 about Amazon or Netflix partnering or buying them out. That would drive the price high instantly. Bear in mind that the streaming giants are facing pressure on growing their market share and AMC makes perfect sense. Also, given their balance sheets the financial risk of buying AMC out at roughly $2bn market cap is negligible.

**Won't streaming kill the movie theatres?**

No, absolutely not. AMC provided $43bn of revenue to film makers in 2019. No studio will forgo that kind of revenue. In fact, from the pilot testing of PVOD they've done, it's actually more lucrative for both theatres and studios to have a short exclusive theatrical release followed by concurrent streaming, than either/or. It's a new model of releasing movies and a much more profitable one. In summary, streaming will actually increase profits for AMC, not take away any.

**Ok, that may be true for the big blockbuster Avenger-type movies, but what about smaller releases? won't they be best stream-only?**

No, they have tested the PVOD deal with small releases (e.g. Kajilionaire which made under $10m revenue in cinemas) and the combined profit for studios/AMC was higher than the older model or what it'd have done streaming alone.

**Analyst ratings:**

According to marketbeat: 4 sell and 6 hold

AMC has the lowest, by far, P/E ratio against its competitors. This means it is perceived as cheap.

**Earnings date: 25 Feb**

&#x200B;

**Major shareholders:**

* Blackrock 2.9% (increased it's position by 70%)
* Vanguard 4.5% (reduced its position slightly by -5%)
* Mittleman 1%
* Norther Trust 0.5% (increased position by 40%)
* Stifel 0.2% (increase position by 285%)
* Bank of NY Mellon 0.2%
* Wells Fargo 0.15%
* Charles Schwab 1% (increased its position by 10%)
* Goldman Sachs 0.6% (increased position by 160%)

**Risks:**

Further dilution in case AMC decides to sell more shares. This can be avoided if theatres start reopening faster or attendance picks up. With vaccinations underway in USA we should soon hear about LA and NYC reopening (NYC already lifte some restrictions in hospitality). People are worried about dilution, but do remember that shareholders were happy to pay high prices for those shares, so they believe they bought in cheap, and they aren't all idiots.

Debt holders pushing hard on AMC. However, this is unlikely to their benefit as any restructuring will take forever and they stand to lose a lot through a prolonged asset sale. It's preferable for debt holders to convert debt to equity and sell - and for that they'd need a good/high stock price.

Further COVID lockdowns because of new variants or whatnot

&#x200B;

**Catalysts**:

Definite: Vaccination roll out means NYC and LA announce reopening of theatres soon.

Possible: Esports partnerships

Who knows: Buyout or partnership with Netflix, Amazon or Disney

**Other**

* Short interest remains high, I believe it was around 68% on 1/31, but someone may correct me if I got this wrong. In any positive newsflow the shorts will be pressed a bit.
* People are gagging to go to the cinema, AMC has had it's best revenue year after year up to 2019. They are not a dying business by any stretch of the imagination.

# The Business Model:

Alibaba serves as the Paypal, Square, eBay and Amazon of China. Alibaba serves as the one stop shop for all ecommerce and even non ecommerce related goods and services. Did I forget to mention Alibaba has its own movie production company? (AMC Anyone?) The synergy of the ecommerce arm: from allowing sales and purchases, accepting payments for sales and purchases, and even potentially financing those same respective sales and purchases makes for an ironclad business model. Alibaba also has numerous investments in many different industries and regions around the globe. 

**Ecommerce, Online Retail, Wholesale** ‚Äì Alibaba‚Äôs bread and butter. Alibaba has a multitude of sales channels that have different buying and selling methods with various different products and audience targets. Their ecommerce encompasses all relationships between consumers, businesses, and both. 

**Cloud** ‚Äì Cloud computing is a top market right now given that we‚Äôre not only working from home due to the pandemic, but we will also implement many of these habits in perpetuity as many businesses switch to a hybrid WFH format. Best synergizes with AutoNavi (Google maps of China) and data collected from consumer sales.

**Digital Entertainment and Media** ‚Äì From streaming to video hosting or even online ticket booking, Alibaba has it all.  You can purchase tickets to your favorite sports event, movie, or watch it all online. 

**Notable Alibaba Owned Companies/Services:**

**Taobao** ‚Äì Marketplace and online retail platform focusing on **consumer to consumer** online stores and purchases. Includes Taobao Grocery, Taobao Short Video, Taobao Live, and many more to come

**Aliexpress** ‚Äì International retail online platform for Chinese sellers to sell products. Example markets may include: Russia, Brazil, Singapore, U.S. and more)

**Tmall ‚Äì** Online retail platform to sell name brand goods to consumers in the greater China region. This is mainly a **business to consumer** platform

**1688.com** ‚Äì Wholesale platform with many digital sellers. This is the largest wholesale website in China which primarily functions as a **business to business** sales platform

**Youku** ‚Äì Digital streaming and online video hosting service for Alibaba; similar to YouTube

**AutoNavi** ‚Äì Maps services; comparable to Google or Apple Maps

**Daimai.cn** ‚Äì Online ticket booking service; Similar to Ticketmaster

**Alipay** ‚Äì Accepting payment methods for your ecommerce purchase, movie tickets, taxis, or even to send from peer to peer. Alipay is standard across many stores in China and many regions in Asia as a dominant payment platform with 

**Ant Financial Group** ‚Äì Fintech; Use for financing for small purchases

**Alihealth** ‚Äì Helps consumers find health insurance and receive medical treatment

# The Bull Case:

**Playing Catch up:** 

Alibaba has crushed earnings on the past 7/7 reports despite regulatory headwinds, international/domestic political pressures, and a pandemic. 

Given the previous financial data, if Alibaba were to trade at even half the P/E of Amazon (78.15/2= \~39) Alibaba would be priced at: **$363.79**

If Alibaba were to be priced at 75% of what Amazon‚Äôs current PE is (78.12\*75% = 58.6125) Alibaba would be priced at: **$545.68**

Analysts currently have a downside price target of $270 and an upside of [$387](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) [according to Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) finance. These price targets can easily be revised upwards with positive sentiment and an increase of both earnings and share price. With an upside of $387 for the year, that‚Äôs approximately 43% upside (even more so with options) that will make your leaps and shares mouthwatering to purchase.

**Who‚Äôs on your side?**

[Cathie Wood](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-sells-tesla-shares-184315217.html)‚Äì As of Nov 2020 sold Tesla shares to purchase Alibaba within its Ark Innovation ETF $ARKF

[Ray Dalio](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Bridgewater+Associates) ‚Äì Recently purchased and currently owns approximately 400 million dollars of Alibaba in the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund which is the largest hedge fund in the world

[Jim Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FASe4D_pEi4&t=140s) \-As of Jan 2021 Lightning round mentioned to buy Alibaba

Most of Wall Street ‚Äì According to [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BABA/price-target/), numerous large institutional banks and equity research firms (including JPM, Citi, HSBC) have buy or strong buy ratings with price targets easily in the 300+ range.

**Potential Catalysts:**

Ant Group IPO ‚Äì For stakeholders, this has been a long awaited IPO. Alibaba owns a 33% stake in Antgroup which was set to be one of the largest fintech IPOs in history before it was blocked by the CCP. A reintroduction of the IPO may send shares flying

More Hedge Fund Buying ‚Äì This stock is one of the largest holdings of many investment funds, hedge funds, and large portfolios. This is also considered a safer stock which appeals more to larger funds who are looking for potential returns

Buybacks ‚Äì Alibaba boosted their current stock buybacks plan from 6B to 10B reiterating confidence within the company and ideally, will boost the stock price 

The monopoly probe ending ‚Äì China slaps Alibaba on the wrist with a few slight changes within the marketplace and a small fine that they can easily write off

China Friendly Political Environment ‚Äì With Trump out and Joe Biden in office, we may see more relaxed regulatory pressure on Chinese stocks (delistings, business bans, etc.)

One of many of their investments kicking off: One example of this is Alibaba's recent partnership with SAIC in the EV space with improved battery technology. If Alibaba is partnered with a company that develops FSD technology, this could be one of their biggest catalysts

The JACK IS BACK: Jack Ma was recently found to be safe through various video clips and word of mouth. If he were to show his face publicly and make a public statement or apology, this could help lift off the stock further

WSB!: Although this is a large cap stock with many shares outstanding, the traction and buying power of WSB collectively could easily put this stock on the radar of larger investment funds and add to share price

# The Bear Case:

**Equity Research Findings:**

>\-A Morningstar equity research report specifically stated: ‚ÄúExpansion of other China digital commerce players like Pinduoduo and JD.com could slow Alibaba's growth aspirations in certain product categories.‚Äù

Translation: Alibaba will STILL grow despite other players gaining in additional market share for the business. Let me repeat this: Alibaba‚Äôs key bear case is that they will not decline or stagnate; THEY WILL STILL GROW albeit slightly slower 

**China will try to take Alibaba out of the picture:**

\-The CCP will end Alibaba and give the reigns to someone else

China and the United States have been in constant fight to come up on top. What makes the United States a dominant force is not only their policy and military, but also our **top companies and infrastructure**. China is aggressively catching up to the United States as a super power as a close second place (See NIO, Xpeng in the EV race compared to Tesla or Huawei vs Apple in the race for 5G infrastructure). Do you think that China would even consider dissolving their top company in terms of internet and consumer infrastructure? Do you think that effectively scaring off fund managers (who currently own Alibaba), foreign investors, and foreign business interests will be a net benefit to China?

\-If you make this claim, read this [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/) by user u/wilfredian before putting your red nose and clown makeup on. TLDR: You can convert your American shares into Hong Kong shares for actual equity ownership at ANY TIME. Meaning it‚Äôs not just some pretend company; it is functionally equivalent to the shares traded on the HK exchange.

The Chinese are looking for more foreign investment in their economy (what developed country isn‚Äôt?). Think about this intuitively, China would not sabotage its golden goose (Alibaba) and breach the contract with many of its foreign partners to flex its political muscle on one company.

When you're shopping for games, go there first. It's silly, again, but if you really believe in the company and want it to grow, you do things like this.

2/20/21 09:34,"DD from Hollywood Film Producer Part II: AMC, Stimulus, and Post-Covid Landscape Alright guys, just got off a group meeting that included John Fithian, President of the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO, lol). They're lobbying to get more stim $$$ to distressed movie theaters. Lemme summarize what I learned, and also **explain why all this is bullish for AMC.**

**1) What did NATO do?**

\-They successfully lobbied for a $15-billion relief package for indie movie theaters that have suffered a greater than 25% revenue loss. This bill, unfortunately doesn't cover AMC, Regal, and Cinemark.

\-However, NATO lobbied to give tax credits for the aforementioned bigger theaters. This might not sound like a lot, but the tax credit was the only thing that allowed TSLA to have profitable quarters prior to last year. 

\-Also, all theater workers (including at AMC), will have unemployment benefits extended nationwide.

\-As if that's not enough, NATO is continuing to lobby for bigger companies like AMC to receive stimulus money.   


**2) Will Streaming Kill theaters after the re-open?**  
\-This seams to be the #1 concern amongst WSBers and reddit people across different subs. Well, I have a great answer for you: NO.

\-NATO, AMC, Regal, Cinemark  worked out deals with most of the major studios to NOT simultaneously release films online with their theatrical releases post-covid. Theatrical box office windows (and their revenues) will therefore be protected once we officially re-open America.  


**3) Consolidation:**

\-Several thousand least-performing theaters have already shut down. This, for better and worse, will help AMC. NATO actually finds this to be a good by-product of covid, as underperforming theaters have been wasteful for movies that screened in them. It's very likely that AMC and or Regal will buy them out and renovate those theaters.   


4**) Pent-up Demand:**

\-Japan and China have reopened their theaters. Both have had RECORD box office numbers with domestic movies that typically don't beat tentpoles like The Avengers or Batman, etc.   


**5) Unprecedented Pipeline:**

It's ultimately all about the movies. Will the be good, and will you see them?  
I'm pleased to say, 2021 and 2022 will be INSANE. 

Normally, you might have one or two big event movies a year. After March, we have like 1 or 2 tentpole releases every month this year, including but not limited to:  
Godzilla Vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Cruella, F9, Uncharted (the movie), Venom sequel, Spider-man sequel, Conjuring sequel, Top Gun sequel, Space Jam (with LBJ), James Bond, Resident Evil and many auteur driven lower budget films by PT Anderson, David Fincher, and Wes Anderson.   


**6) Theaters found more ways to make money:**

\-Also, the closure of the theaters was an opportunity for the bigger theater chains to improve and re-model their outdated systems. 

\-Many rear-projection screens (that require projectionists and expensive projectors) are being replaced by LED screens. 

\-Sound systems are being dramatically improved. 

\-The seats will have tables, suitable for the service of Wine, Beer, and Meals.  


**7) The Craziest (and likely) Scenario:**

\-The Paramount Consent Decrees are being repealed. This decree basically prevented one company from producing and exhibiting films. 

\-NATO is now in talks with Apple, Amazon, and Netflix to screen content in movie theaters.   
Netflix has already bought a number of independent theaters. 

\-There are rumors about AAPL or AMZN acquiring AMC!  John didn't deny those rumors.  


**TL;DR** \- Stimulus has lagged in helping the movie theaters because they were deemed ""non-essential,"" but not anymore. Money's on the way. Also, after we re-open, we'll have one of the most ridiculously popular films released all at once for the next two years, in protected viewing windows in which theaters will not compete with streamers like Netflix and Amazon. On the contrary, Amazon or Apple might acquire theater companies, like AMC and Regal due to the repeal of the Paramount Consent Decrees.

A good amount of the congressmen/women yesterday spouted out bullshit and an overwhelming amount talked about nonsense regulations instead of questioning the issues that occurred on Jan 24th - Jan 30th. I do agree that 90% of the interviews were hogwash and used for political posturing, but a few of them were utter all-stars and should be called out!

I have re-watched the hearing yesterday and sorted out the bullshit and provided a few below names of congress people that we should rally behind and their main talking points/questions during the hearing:

**Anthony ""5:11 AM Liquidity"" Gonzalez (OH) -**

RepAGonzalez

Interview starts at 3h43m

Anthony is the only person so far in the ENTIRE WORLD to have Vlad fess up that he did not have the liquidity to make the $3 Billion Clearing House fee at 5:11 AM. Vlad has utterly dodged this question from CNBC, Elon, etc. and Anthony is the first one to question this. Additionally, he brought out the point that RH was about to be liquefied by the DTCC and pulled the plug to cover their own asses rather than look out for their customers. Multiple times Anthony stated there is clearly a systemic problem here that needs to be corrected. I cannot praise this guy enough! He did his homework and asked AMAZING questions!

**Michael ‚ÄúWho Called In The Artillery‚Äù San Nicolas (Guam) -**

GuamCongressman

Interview starts at 3h 48m

Michael was like a damn artillery strike. Anthony was right before him as the infantry, then Michael came in pounding Vlad and team like 40mm cannons on Omaha Beach. Holy shit did this dude go off. Michael brought the fact that not only did RH fuck every one of their customers over, THEY PROTECTED THEMSELVES from larger losses! Paraphrasing: That $3 Billion capital that you had to raise would have been more if you didn‚Äôt halt trading on the stock! You protected yourselves from larger losses that the $3 billion that you had to raise.

**Juan ‚ÄúRobbinDaHood‚Äù Vargas (CA) -**

RepJuanVargas

Interview starts at 3h 8m

Called out Robin hood and the rest of the Hedge Funds that Robin Hood can no longer use that name because they are actually the inverse of Robin Hood and stealing from the poor. ‚ÄúGriffin, how many people are in the room with you right now?‚Äù He didn‚Äôt ask too many technical questions, but he did a great job at pinpointing that in reality Robin Hood‚Äôs true customers are the hedge funds and the users are merely products.

**Blaine Leutkemeyer (MO) -**

RepBlaine

Interview starts at 1h 39m

Now, this guy looks like a good ole boy and I was about to write him off...but he started to truly question manipulation of a stock price. Additionally, he further pushed in saying that if a stock is 140% over-leveraged clearly manipulation is occurring on the stock. He ran out of time, but this is clearly the guy we need to go with for getting deeper into manipulation of stocks questions and why the stock was over-leveraged so much in the first place!

**Al ‚ÄúCost of Doing Business‚Äù Green**

RepAlGreen

Interview starts at 1h 55m

Brought facts and figures showing that Melvin/Citadel has inquired millions of fines, but in reality those fines are far less than the money they are making on the shady deals they are performing. This is the representative that we support to increase the fines and regulation on these shady hedge funds.

**Honorable mentions:**

**Steve Stivers (OH) -**

RepSteveStivers

‚ÄúVlad, does the stock go up or down when you take out demand?‚Äù

**Warren Davidson (OH) -**

WarrenDavidson

Advocated for B l oc k c ha i n and that their schemes would not work in the B l oc k c ha i n environment. Griffin‚Äôs eyes were utterly terrified when Warren was speaking.

**Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY)**

AOC

She did great in the form of asking about naked shorting (before she got cut off), but was asking Vlad to essentially make his company free by giving money to his users via payments for order flow. This is not the answer, AOC is essentially trying to make a company free...which is not realistic. We know that RH is predatory, but this terrifies me if this is where she‚Äôs going. Correct me if I misunderstood please! Also, she appears to be checking her twitter for DD!

**Sean Casten (IL)**

SeanCasten

Called RH to call out Vlad‚Äôs shitty customer service. This was great, but we all know RH has shitty customer service and we‚Äôre not here for that. Also, I almost felt like he was alluding to that if you are below 21 you should not be able to buy stocks‚Ä¶.

**Andy Barr (KY)**

RepAndyBarr

Talked about non-sense regulations for a good portion of the interview, but finished at discussing naked shorting and this is likely what was happening here.

So I‚Äôve made a list of questions we‚Äôd like to see asked and answered.
No more bullshit!


1. Vlad, Confirm date, time and timezone you referred to when you said that 5am was when you were given notice to new margin requirements on the 28th of January.

2. DTCC confirmed they waived their margin requirements 30minutes before market open on the 28th of January. You stated those margin requirements were the reason for limiting purchasing of AMC and GME. If those requirements were waived, why did you limit the sale, and why did you lie during our last meeting?
 why were those trading restrictions continued after Robinhood was aware of the margin requirements being lifted?

3. Citadel, you‚Äôve had adequate time sense out last questioning to verify if someone at Citadel was in direct contact with Robinhood regarding GME and AMC directly. Was any current or prior employee, contractor or fulltime, in contact with Robinhood directly regarding these tickers?

4. Citadel, you injected several Billion dollars into Melvin Capital and also have financial ties to Robinhood. Do you believe that is a conflict of interest

5. Vlad, who made the offer to restrict buying on AMC and GME? Why were those stocks specifically picked when you chose to restrict

6. Vlad, Why did you restrict buying of shares and options when you could have made restrictions on options alone to satisfy what you claim were increased margin requirements. When someone has cash to purchase shares that are not on margin why restrict them?

7. Vlad, free and efficient markets would dictate that if there were ever a moment in which stock needed to be paused, it would have been paused for both buying and selling and that options contracts would be adjusted for time. Why was this not your approach?

8. Why didnt the SEC step in and halt trading

9. Why does IBKR say they were worried about locating shares? Why were shorts not forced to close their positions?

10. Vlad, did Robinhood reachout to the SEC for recommendations regarding how to handle the AMC and GME stock before cutting off retail investors and not Hedgefunds?

11. Melvin, do you know what a short ladder is?

12. Melvin, were you aware there was a handful of traders after the stock was restricted that were using a shortladder technique to further drive down share value of AMC and GME? Their trading charts were almost identical which is a statistical impossibility unless automated systems were artificially brining down those shares.

13. Melvin, did you increase your short interest in GME during the January 28th retail stock restrictions?

14. Melvin, do you or anyone at your company have any have knowledge of contact with media, including social media, to spread false information regarding GME or AMC?

15. Citadel, do you or anyone at your company have any knowledge of contact with media outlets, including social media, to spread false information regarding GME or AMC?

16. Vlad, were you or anyone at Robinhood in contact with Interactive Brokers about GME or AMC, anytime in the leading up to the January 28th stock restrictions?

17. Vlad, the ceo of Interactive Brokers admitted on live TV(Feb 17th) that if buying restrictions were not set on retail investors then share price of GME would have forced shares to go into the 1000‚Äôs. Causing shortsellers like Melvin to default on their brokers leaving brokers covering themselves. Was this the real reason you cut off retail investors?

18. Citadel, the number of shares that failed to deliver on GME is massive. Were the ‚Äúfailures to deliver‚Äù an artificial tool used to drive down share price? Do you have knowledge of someone who did?

19. Melvin, did you take advantage of stock ‚Äúfailure to deliver‚Äù to bring down share price of GME and AMC? Do you have knowledge of someone who did?

20. Melvin, last time you admitted to a gamma squeeze of shares on GME. Is it still possible if another buying frenzy happened that an actual short squeeze would take place?

21. DFV, do you think that if another buying frenzy happens on GME and AMC that another potentially huge short squeeze will happen?

22. Melvin, what is your current short interest in AMC and GME?

23. Citadel, if another buying frenzy happens on stock like AMC and GME, what kind of a loss could citadel directly see?

24. DFV, are you confident enough in GME to allow your options to execute and buy more shares at a deep discount?

25. DFV, what could executives at GME do to protect their shareholders at this point?",34564,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999804676,True

2/21/21 12:15,"Estimating Robinhood‚Äôs Assets Under Management Vlad bragged about customers $35B in unrealized profits over deposited funds in the financial hearing

There are 13 million RH accounts

Google searches claim average RH acct value is <$5k but I‚Äôm very skeptical that‚Äôs accurate

Assuming a range of $5k to $10k for average acct value would mean that Robinhood manages between 

$50B to $130B

Subtracting the quoted unrealized gains of $35B, would mean initial deposited customer funds were

$15B to $95B

Well $15B is too low that would mean avg retail account is up nearly 200% 

While $95B would still be approx 30% return 

Why does this matter?

Robinhood likely has more than $100B in Assets Under Management and they couldn‚Äôt even post $3B or even $1.4B of company funds to meet capital requirements. It‚Äôs their job to do this every single day, this isn‚Äôt an unforeseen business anomaly. And that‚Äôs less than 3% of money managed. So they are negligently under capitalized, even with the recent $3.4B raise. 

If Robinhood had met the capital requirements on the 28th, they would have failed to on the 29th as the Value at Risk continued to climb. In fact they will fail again if meme stocks take off before they raise again or IPO successfully.

Furthermore NSCC / DTC claim they provide tools & calculators to their members which allow them to estimate the required daily deposit and any hypothetical scenario. And Vlad has publicly admitted to following the GME action on Reddit for weeks prior to the spike (on the All-In podcast IIRC). They also limited AMC on margin days before GME became non-margin, which is questionable oversight in risk management practice.


P.S. I do agree with one point from Vlad, we need to switch to T0 or real-time settlement. T+1 is a cheap cop out that allows all of these things to occur again. As well as all of the shadowy things with share failure to deliver and short sales to continue to occur. Lastly the NSCC states that would lower required deposits 30-40% which means the trading halt still would have happened a day or two later.

To start - I have several hundred shares of AMC from before the whole blow up of GME + AMC. So call me a shill and I'll John Travolta meme at your comment.

Do I think AMC price will go up eventually? Yes, absolutely.

If you think that 99.2% of AMC stock is held, you're wrong. Look at Disney. It's at 99.9%. Does that mean that only 0.1% of people are selling Disney? Is Disney gonna moon to $1000 all of a sudden? NO. You need to LEARN about what these values mean. Let's explain why none of what you're believing is true.

&#x200B;

Look, I get it. Some of you are well versed in stocks and just freshly made a Reddit account. Some of you are new to the world of stocks in general. And some of you just can't fucking spell correctly in your titles. You heard the hype and joined in for the fun or possibility of profit. Well, educating yourself is the best thing you can do. The last thing you wish to become is sheep, following what others say without being able to understand if what they say is true or false.

&#x200B;

Let's begin:

The main example today - the bullshit 99.2% of **all** AMC shares being held.

Wow, do you fucking hear yourselves? Does that sound even remotely like it makes any sense? You truly believe that out of the entire world, 99.2% of all people that own AMC stock are simply holding it? For one moment, try to remember that Reddit is not the world. There are, as impossible as you might think, people that own AMC stock that are not part of this subreddit or any others. Think of all the automated algorithms that day trade vast quantities. All of them only amount to 0.8%?

""But I saw 99.2% on some screenshot of some website!""

You sure did. But did you know what that 99.2% was actually indicating? No, of course not. It's a far more blissful experience to see the number, hear some fuckwit tell you it's gonna moon **based on that**, and then you post üíéüôå and scratch your head why it didn't happen a week later.

&#x200B;

Here's what it actually indicates: there's a 99.2% ratio of the **float shares** to the **outstanding shares**.

What does that mean? Well, like half the posts in [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/), it's really fucking simple to Google. Here's an extremely dumbed down version:

&#x200B;

Outstanding Shares: all the shares of the company including **institutional** shares + **restricted** shares

Institutional Shares: shares that other companies hold in that stock.

Restricted Shares: shares potentially for employees. You as a retail investor don't have access to these.

Float Shares: all the shares minus the **restricted** shares. This is also called the **PUBLIC** float because it's the amount of shares that are available on any given day for the public to trade with.

&#x200B;

Sooo, using words instead of numbers for some quick algebra, what have we concluded?

Float / Outstanding shares simply means all of the AMC shares that are available to the public. 99.2% of all the shares (outstanding share) of AMC are available for the public to purchase (float share). This percentage is BASED ON some website's analysis and the actual numbers will of course be different depending of what website you look at because no one actually has the precise number.

&#x200B;

2/20/21 12:03,"$AMC Diamond Hands Trade Idea (earnings next week) Hello WSB,

I come before you to present an $AMC trade that will ensure shares are held through earnings AND will help in the event that the stock tanks even further. The only cost is a small bit of margin needed to hold the position for each put sold ($50).

On the option chain expiring the first week in March, the trade is to sell one put at the 5.50 strike, buy one put at the 5.00 strike and two at the 4.50 strike (ratio backspread basically). I was able to put on this position for a $0.03 credit. Surprising, since I thought OOTM puts would be higher priced going into earnings. You CAN do this with puts expiring next week, but there's almost no time for the trade to develop post-earnings. 

So how does this trade work?

$AMC blows out earnings: Moonshot, short squeeze and the hedged put position expires worthless (you get to keep the small credit). Nothing lost and tendies for all.

$AMC stays stagnant: Position will likely expire worthless, but 5.50 puts could either be closed for cheap or if the stock dips into the 5.50 range, you'll own shares at that price. Not too bad. This is probably the worst scenario.

$AMC tanks: Sell the whole position for a profit, offsetting (paper) losses from the stock. OR sell the long puts and take possession of the shares via assignment of the short put at a cost of 5.50 per share (read: don't waste money covering the short put!). I mean, you WANT more shares anyway for the eventual squeeze. This kills two birds with one stone.

For me, I'm holding 700 AMC shares and I'm holding 15 of the above ratio spreads (short 15 5.50 puts, long 15 5.00 puts, long 30 4.50 puts). I may add to both, depending on how the market behaves.

Good luck with earnings next week. And thank you for this great subreddit!",34768,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.957591653,True

If you are new to investing and jumped in with Robinhood, WeBull, Fidelity or other brokers in GME, AMC, BB, NOK or any other stocks, don't forget to file your 1099-B next year. Or the IRS WILL come for dat ass and if you think investing in risky plays is tarded, wait until you're served with a crisp penalty you can't afford to pay. Your broker will send the 1099-B to the IRS so they already have it and are waiting on you to file it to make sure it matches their records. Don't think that because you lost money, or ""diDn'T mAkE enOuGh"" you don't have to file it.

You can file yourself or if you're feeling lazy, use TurboTax and most brokers have an auto-import option there. I know Robinhood and Fidelity do, not sure about others.

I won't link to them on here but you can find many stories on Reddit by people who didn't file taxes, did wash sales and all sorts of things that raise red flags with the tax man and you'll see it's all fun and games until it happens to you. Never go full retard.

So I started hording some stocks and found once you get 100 you can now sell covered calls.  This is basically finding someone else who wants the option to buy your stocks at a set price and will pay you a little bit for that privelege. 

This is where I don't understand how it's not a great deal.

Let's say AMC you have 200 shares.  Doable with a $1500 investment.   You can sell a call for $9 and $12 ending this Friday and make $32 & $11.  So in one week you made $43.  That's almost a 3% gain in a week.  You can do this every week.  $43 * 52 = 2,236.  With a $15k investment you can make $1600/month before taxes in passive income... 

The downside is üöÄ and AMC jumps to $20 or more in any given week. You lose out on a potential $4000 worth of stock and the sweet karma, but both options would exercise and you would get 100*9 +100*12 = $2100 + $43 premium.

As I'm sure most of you know, talks of inflation and increased rates are circulating the news and subreddits. Also, Jerome Powell (our boy JPOW big boy money printer) talked to the Senate today.   


Here are the most common indicators for Stock Market Crashes. 

**Rampant Speculation of Stocks**

This is seen everywhere, in our current market: SPAC‚Äôs being the main culprit. But also things like AMC and GME, digital currencies. 

**Rampant Speculation effect on the economy:** Prices go up! And this causes a Bubble. 

(yea its dumbed down)

**Slowing Growth Rates of Economy:** 

Inflation: Do I really need to explain how there is stupid amounts of inflation happening

GDP: The GDP still hasn‚Äôt reached its previous level of COVID-19

Unemployment: Total Unemployment is 6.3%, Women 6%, black or African American 9%, bottom 25% of wealth is 25% unemployed.

**Peak Valuations:** P/E ratios are through the roof on every single stock compared to historic terms.

**Lower Interest Rates:**

Interest rates are pretty much 0% right now. 

**Potential Catalysts of an Entire Crash of the Market:**  
Its staring us in the face: **Rise of Interest rates**

Why would this cause the crash. Well go do your DD if you don‚Äôt understand why. Or go look look at the SPY max, and when the interest rates go up and Compare them.   


**Effect JPOW had today:** 

JPOW, stood by his guns and said that the interest rates will not increase for the near future. Even with the future rises of inflation, due to the base standard and the increase in demand from the opening up post covid.  
He also said something interesting and insightful of when we will see Interest rates rise. When Unemployment goes down. Some background information is that before COVID the Fed was constantly talking about how minorities and lower wealth people were adding to the recovery of the Economic state of the US.   
I personally don‚Äôt think JPOW is going to hike interest rates until the unemployment.

&#x200B;

**My Strategy:** 

I think there is going to be a major pull back 10% or so in the economy when people see heightened inflation rates this April or May. I have SPY puts expiring JUNE.

Going to monitor Unemployment rates and Interest rates closely. When the lower quartile of wealths unemployment decreases to near average or TOtal unemployment rates, I will probably enter bear mode, and buy PUTs on the majority of the market. Probably heavy puts on the DIA and XLK.   
DIA because they have the cheapest ones, and XLK because I think tech will plummet for sell offs since their valuations are the highest.

**Positions:** 

XLK Puts expiring June 18th

SPY Puts expiring June 18th

Moderate amount DIA Puts expiring Jan 2022 

\^

Will times 4 what I have in there if the unemployment lowers.   


When unemployment is decreased in the lowest 25tile, I will probably buy Puts expiring 1-2 years out.",35228,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.627872407,True

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First off this message is not financial advice. I just wanted to inform people of future catalyst that we are about to hit.

AMC is hyped and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. I suggest you to buy as much as you can within a value that you are comfortable sitting on for the next month. I think there is a potential for huge returns. We have multiple events that could work as catalysts for some significant future gains.

Here they are:

* FINRA reports (2/25 release): this will help us confirm if there is still an opportunity for a short squeeze
* Q4 Earnings (3/5 release): this could cause a huge spike in buys since I expect to see an uptrend in revenue due to states opening back up. Also keep in mind the last bump allowed AMC to pay off a bunch of their built up debt caused by COVID-19 closing
* COVID-19 vaccines: large number of people are getting the vaccine which will cause a surge in hope for the light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday we saw what happened when NYC announced re-opening of all of their theaters to 25%

I repeat this is not financial advice and I don't want you to buy due to FOMO but I think this bet has a good short term and long term play. Short term is we get a nice short squeeze. Long term is the stock settles to over $20 like its competitors. The worlds largest theater chain should not be trading for 1/4 of its competition.

If you want to play it relatively safe then please only invest money that will not needed for at least a year. This way you can play the short and long game.

Love you all! I hope this is prosperous for you all and any money troubles you have can be washed away! Go get them apes!

-  This is a real recovery play.  Look at IMAX as the perfect example.  They have a big market share in China, and China being first out of lockdown (still some partial lockdown in different cities), is recovering and everyone want to go out and watch movies.  That is why IMAX killed their earnings.  This will happen in the US as well, 100%.  New York partially opened their theatres, and this will continue across the board.  It is just a matter of time.

- **Very Important**  They will not go into bankruptcy.  This is the key factor here.  They just raised another 917 million, so bankruptcy is completely out of the question.  This in itself is already very bullish, as you don't have to wake up one morning and find your company filing for chapter 11.  Yes, they won't be able to restructure their debt, BUT, it is much easier for them to raise cash and your shares won't turn into fairy dust.  

https://torontosun.com/business/money-news/u-s-theatre-chain-amc-says-bankruptcy-talk-is-completely-off-the-table

-  There is a lot of interest from the retail public/publicity on this stock from the whole saga a month ago.  

- look at the options chain, there are a lot of interest further out so there are a lot of bullish investors.   Since there is an dilution of 3x the outstanding shares to avoid bankruptcy, everyone should note at $10/share today it is already at it's ATH.  So play your options carefully.  But then again, valuation multiples are much higher today than it was before.  Don't play with money you can't afford to lose please.

- Potential buy out from big boys (doubt it, not at this price but who knows lol)

NOTE: They have earnings in two days.  Feb 25.  It will probably beat estimate but honestly no one knows.  If you want to be safe, maybe wait for the dip on earnings report and buy in after the report and before the earnings call?  Because earnings call will for sure be super bullish from management.  You can buy the gap.

2/23/21 09:53,"$NVDA Long Thesis It‚Äôs been a crazy past week+ into today with rising yields and stocks that were on breakout tracks for new highs pulling back.

So what do you do when all hope seems lost?

Idk, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, but what I did was double down.

After experiencing a net loss this year of over $30k with GME, AMC, TSLA, AI, and more, I‚Äôm more determined than ever to ignore the pullback while my options bleed in delta and time decay and instead just buy more and hold.

This brings me to NVDA. NVDA is the undisputed king of semiconductors (although some AMD fans try to dispute) with a market cap of $355B and a P/E ratio of 93.83. That P/E ratio is arguably high even for a bull market but let‚Äôs be clear, not even 1 week ago NVDA reached a new ATH $614.90 blowing past its previous one of $582ish in this most recent breakout run.

So what has changed from last week to today? Absolutely very little except a massive increase in fear due to a slight 10yr treasury yield increase from 1.25%ish to 1.36%ish. 

A treasury yield increase is actually good as it indicates sentiment from bond holders that the economy will grow faster than expected. Inflation of 1% - 3% is even healthy for large tech companies such as NVDA as they can increase the price higher than the increasing cost resulting in greater earnings, especially in high profit margin areas with its Mellanox acquisition. 

For the fundamentalists in the room that don‚Äôt buy stocks because they like the company nor believe in their long-term values, high P/E ratio is justified in believing the E (earnings) will grow higher in the coming year. Chip shortage (indicating growing demand) is expected to continue for another year, https://www.marketwatch.com/story/worldwide-chip-shortage-expected-to-last-into-next-year-and-thats-good-news-for-semiconductor-stocks-11614020156, which will massively increase that earnings potential and the data center will continue to grow with growth from last quarter 162% YoY - https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/nvidias-rapid-data-center-growth-is-here-to-stay/. 

Inflation increases the cost of debt but NVDA doesn‚Äôt need debt and has been cash positive for a while. It‚Äôs debt-to-assets ratio has been decreasing YoY (short of 2020 because of COVID and growth expenses) and it‚Äôs on track for record breaking results this earnings report on Wed.

 üöÄüöÄüöÄ A growing economy is good for profitable companies like NVDA and even if this price is a premium, it‚Äôs worth it because NVDA delivers the goods. Even Wall Street agrees with analysts raising PTs to $700. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Note: I‚Äôm long NVDA because you would be crazy not to be.

Warren Buffet said, ‚Äú... be greedy when others are fearful‚Äù and now there is a lot of fear with TSLA and large tech stocks and high valuations. Now is the time to double down in this bullish market because here is the best news, on Wed 2/24, our buddy, Powell, is gonna buy a ton more 10yr bonds driving the price up and yields back down. https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details#current-schedule. And in a few weeks from then, he‚Äôs gonna do it again, and then again and again and again. Yield rises will be capped at an upper limit because of $80b/mo coming into them. The Fed has made it very clear that it has no intention of reducing that for years+ as it will allow inflation  to rise beyond 2% to average 2% across a multi-year period. The government wants inflation to rise because it wants to wane away its debt and so there will be Yellen support to keep the money press printing longer than people think.

2/23/21 08:59,"Think like a boomer and buy $PEP calls Disclaimer: I'm an idiot, who despite starting an Etrade account in 2007 has underperformed the market. Generally took a passive approach, but like 7 million of your new closest friends, got interested in options because of GME and I'm rolling some AMC profits into Pepsi calls. Do not take my advice.

Why $PEP, a boring ass boomer stock? Well, a few reasons. Firstly, earlier this month Pepsi announced that they would have a quarterly dividend of $1.0225 a share, a 7% increase versus the comparable year-ago period. If you own the stock by March 3rd, and hold it through the end of the month, you get paid.

Cool dude, I can get four dollars and nine cents a share per year when I just lost five figures diamond holding GME. Yeah, it's a boomer thing to care about, but I'm not gonna lie, I'm excited to get my $57.26 in late March for my common shares. And I'm betting a lot of risk averse bears like myself are thinking the same way. Google best dividend stocks - Pepsi comes up frequently. All these boomer money managers are going to want to show some cash in their clients accounts - they're moving over to Pepsi.

You're probably thinking I'm an idiot for believing I'm the first person to consider that stocks might rise before a dividend payout. Clearly the market will account for this and price it in beforehand. I'm not outsmarting Wall St. However, I do believe there might be extra pressures this year that just might not be accounted for. We're all a little nervous in this market. Money flew to travel stocks today and out of tech. But once travel stocks take their profits, I think dividend stocks will seem extra comfortable.

In addition, $PEP has been a little unloved lately, despite surviving COVID just fine and slightly beating earnings estimates. Their forecast was boring and nothing special, just like it should be for the company, but in this insane tech valuation market Wall St has sent the stock in a slow sell off. I don't understand technicals, but it looks like the stock is potentially oversold, and that most of the sellers are now out of the game, and dividend buyers are ready to jump back in:

Basically it‚Äôs John Wick, but Robinhood killed his dog (i.e. GameStop) and he fights off all the hedges to get sweet revenge on Robinhood for destroying his baby and taking away his tendies.

2/25/21 22:36,"AMC GME difference ‚Äì Not the short or Gamma Squeeze candidate you think it is ‚Äì real short interest a lot lower due to massive share count increase and dilution. mportant discussion point on AMC - which I think is very different to GME.

There has been a lot of confusion about the amount of shares outstanding AMC has. The company issued a lot (c.350m shares recently) from its roughly 100m pre COVID count. When measuring total shares out on loan or short (which is roughly 48m) it is important to understand how big the free float actually is.

According to this SEC filing filed by AMC: (you can find all filings if you search AMC SEC):

[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/512648ea-ce75-4aef-8855-55b8d3fd9709.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/512648ea-ce75-4aef-8855-55b8d3fd9709.html)

The share count after the ATM program completed was: 365m (all float)

This was before Sikverlake converted their convertible into an additional 44m of shares.

See filing here:

After that Wanda converted roughly 50m B shares into A shares to sell them off

**To summarize:**

**there is about 450m shares (365+44+50)=450 shares outstanding ‚Äì and that is all float.**

**So its short interest about 10% of float.... market watch has the wrong shares outstanding and the 80% is purely wrong as they have a float of around 57m (which used to be the old A shares before they started issuing more stock)**

This are the official SEC filings ‚Äì also AMC has a share authorisation for a further 500m shares‚Ä¶ when the stock goes up they just turn up the dilution tap.

**Given the trading volume it takes a whopping 0.2-0.3 days to cover the short.. hardly critical and hardly heavy shorted. and 100m of options do not make the difference... that is another 0.2d**

**Fundamentally it‚Äôs a terrible company (not that fundamentals matter too much)**

\- AMC has never produced any FCF. It had 5bn of debt before COVID at relatively low interest payments.

\- Due to COVID they had to raise an additional 1200m of debt at high cost. The last 100m loan from Mudrich Capital charged 17!!! %

\- To stay alive they had to print stock at a rapid speed. Share count is not 4.5x pre COVID. It was trading below USD 10 pre covid.

\- Why would it trade above an implied USD 50 (at current share prices) Despite 1bn + extra debt?

**So this short term momentum squeeze might be very very short lived. Enjoy it while it lasts..**

Big F to all the palantards, took quite a while to reply to everyone

About GME I still don't know what to do today. A part of me says ""fucking sell and cash out"", the other part is thinking: what if this gets to "" the thousands"", like the CEO of Interactive Brokers said it could have happened on the first squeeze if they didn't restrict buying the stock?

I'm in a Robin Hood group on Facebook and the sentiment is all for AMC, almost noone supports GME, most of them hate it. And I think this is good cause it makes me think that most of GME hodlers already left Robin Hood. So this time their tricks might not work again!

Thinking rationally: I'm up few months of my salary so far and it wouldn't change much to me, so I guess I'll just hold and buy the dip (I hope there will be one at the opening)! You think about your financial situation and behave accordingly, don't listen to anyone

Finally, about PLTR, I closed the position. I liked a DD I red here yesterday and I'll be buying it back in 1-2 weeks at 25

Similarly, there are [117,911 GME calls expiring this friday](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options).

Since each contract represents 100 shares, if every one of these calls expires in the money **53 million shares of AMC will need to be bought and 11.7 million shares of GME will need to be bought in order to fulfill these contracts**.

According to [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/), AMC has a float of 136 million shares, while GME has a float 45 million shares.

_________

This means the % of the total shares that will need to be bought for each of these stocks are the following:

53M / 136M = **39% of float for AMC**


11.7M / 45M = **26% of float for GME**

In reality these percentages are higher since not all the shares are actually available to be purchased.

2/25/21 16:24,"Large Purchases of GME, EXPR, AMC, NAKD, SNDL last hour of today's market closing Explanation of the stock movement today for those that don't understand.

In the last hour of trading today, we saw large purchases of GME, EXPR, AMC, NAKD, SNDL stocks.

These purchases most likely came from the MM who bought due to the volume of Call/Put Options on the stock.

With the release of the Short Interest report to the public in the after-hours trading session, the MM took proactive steps to leverage risk. The MM has to hold a number of shares as they see fit to support volatility trading due to people's awareness of the short interest, the volume of stock trading, and other factors.

This chart shows a good example of the other factors.

What you have seen is short term momentum trading ‚Äì and this has very very short legs as seen before and as its not a real short squeeze your upside is capped. 

\-	As per latest data 48m share are out on loan. This is slightly up from end of Jan. 

\-	BUT: the free float is now 430m shares after the company printed 250m of shares, Wanda converted B to A shares and sold them off and Silverlake converted their convertible to shares.

\-	Hence short is about 10% of float and given the trading volume it takes a whopping 0.2-0.3 days to cover the short

\-	They will print more shares and have a further 500m authorized

\-	Mgmt. will sell their shares after they are no longer restricted post earning

**2.	Fundamentally it‚Äôs a terrible company.** 

\-	AMC has never produced any FCF. It had 5bn of debt before COVID at relatively low interest payments.

\-	Due to COVID they had to raise an additional 1200m of debt at high cost. The last 100m loan from Mudrich Capital charged 17!!! %

\-	To stay alive they had to print stock at a rapid speed. Share count is not 4.5x pre COVID. It was trading below USD 10 pre covid. 

\-	Why would it trade above an implied USD 50 (at current share prices) Despite 1bn + extra debt?

However, higher IV options means a higher current price whereas a lower IV options appreciates based on both increase in stock price and increase in IV.  Take a look at the current IV of the above three stocks, see the links below.

Essentially GME IV at 700, AMC at around 300 and BB Options at 100.  For you tards that have no idea what this means‚Ä¶essentially you are too fucking poor to buy GME options.
Now let‚Äôs simulate a 50% increase and what that means on the option that is closest OTM.
GME - Stock 168 to 252 Option Feb26 170c  goes from 23.58 to 81.41 (3x assuming IV stays the same)
AMC - Stock 11.1 to 16.65 Option Feb26 12c  goes from .36 to 4.72 (13X assuming IV+100)

2/26/21 06:43,"PLEASE READ!!!! (GME) WHY THE DIP IS GOOD!!!! **Ok look, idiots, I am no genius, but this drop from 170 to 100ish is not all bad.  TL/DR at the bottom for the most autist...**

Here is why- 

1) **We are still up huge from the close of yesterday** and have seen a solid ground at the 106 range. This establishes a floor, i.e. the minimum amount of money the stock can go if paper hands sell.

2) I have read multiple articles claiming **that Short Sellers just on Wednesday lost a total of 818 million.** Why is this important you may ask?? Well simply put for you fellow atuists, with these HF down nearly a billion in one day, they can't continue the squeeze because they have no capital to buy the calls back. **So this might leave us with no large increases until Monday until capital can be raised to cover.** 

3) We know from the past, that without capital **A) there can't be any short latter attacks B) the HF will be forced to pay high interest on these positions if they don't cover them. C) there will be a continuation of a squeeze if we hold.** 

IT won't LET ME POST THE LINK- just look it up it's the first article.

4) **Other shorted stocks have a good chance at rising too.** Rember GME is the big whale while other shorts like AMC, NOK, and BB are more like fishes (still valuable but not like the whale). So while HF gathers capital to cover shorts on GME, **they will have to pay BIG BIG BIG bucks on interest with the other smaller stocks.** 

**TL/DR: don't panic because you see a drop right now, there is a good chance that it is because of limited capital from HF because of Wednesday's crash, leading to no money to cover shorts.** This means HF will be forced to pay interest on the positions they still have and will lead to a bigger squeeze in the next few days.

2/26/21 05:06,"Just wanted to thank you Apes Admittedly, I'm new here. New enough to easily be accused of being a bot, or a shill, but I look forward to earning my place here, and your trust, in due time.

(Sorry if I used the wrong flair.)

I started trading last year as a bit of a pandemic hobby, and because my girlfriend had gotten me into it. It was something fun that we could do together and I was excited to learn, since she had about a year's more experience, and a Master's degree in finance. The only hiccup is that she's a lot more risk-averse than I am, so our trading strategies didn't often align.

I've never had much money, and literally lived in a car (or Jeep) for most of my adult life, and will probably go back to doing that once the pandemic is over and being a drifter is more feasible again. (I travel for work, so I was always employed.) I usually described my life like a monk without a religion, just going from place to place wherever I thought I could do the most good. (Though, to be fair, I usually claim my religion as Jedi, because I'm a nerd.) Any money I made, I typically gave it away. I've spent years doing work with causes ranging from children's hospitals to veterans issues to LGBTQ+ and equality concerns. My main interest in life has always been helping people, and my primary financial daydream has always been about funding charities, giving money away to people who need it, and figuring out ways to funnel my wealth into causes worth supporting. 

I've managed to turn $2,000 into roughly $12,000 over the past year, and then fell in with you Apes at the end of January, like so many others did. I YOLO'd into AMC and GME because, like so many of you, I dove in with the mindset of, ""I've been poor forever. I can go back to being even poor-er.""

It's been so genuinely exciting to be around people with whom I share a risk-loving mentality, where I see so many willing to dive right in, knowing full well that we could lose it all, or gain so incredibly much. It was especially heartwarming to see how many of you took those first GME tendies and turned right around to give to children's hospitals, or other important causes. That's when I knew I'd found my people. Right now, I've got everything in GME and AMC, and I might lose it all, but that's no worries. If it goes well, though, then this money could go to do a world of good, and I owe that possibility to each and every one of you.  


**TL;DR: I'm grateful to be here, excited to get to know you, and very hopeful that I can continue to learn lessons (either good or bad) from probably the most hilarious investors I've ever seen in any casino in order to put some good in the world. Cheers to you all, and thank you.**

AMC as we all know closed about the $8 mark on Friday the 26th (closed at $8.01). Because of this, over 18,000 call options were able to be executed due to the fact they were in the money. This means that 1,800,000 shares of AMC will be purchased as a result. On Friday, we also saw a call option volume of over 300,000 contracts meaning that hedge funds/sellers of these contracts will need to buy 100 shares per contract in order to hedge the position. This is how a gamma squeeze is formed. Through the massive amount of buys for this particular share. 

On top of this AMC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market with a short interest similar to GameStop‚Äôs. It is also one of the most active stocks in terms of daily volume. With that said, AMC had potential to form a short squeeze on top of the gamma squeeze that is going to occur this upcoming week. This has the potential to his not $10, $20, $30 per share but above $100 per share if we all hold our shares. There will be information put out to scare us into selling. There will be ladder attacks to bring the price down. But all we have to do is hold.

**BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**

Option holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.

This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).

It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.

There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.

AMC has A LOT MORE: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.

BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.

NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.

Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).

Everyone have a great weekend.

2/26/21 20:28,"Meredith Corporation (MDP) Hi WSB, this is my first post here. Not going to lie, I only found this site after the hype on GME, AMC and others.    

Personally I'm not much for hype in general but I do like investing and here is one of my picks from this summer: Meredith Corporation (MDP)  

MDP is a media company and holds several well known magazine brands such as People and Allrecipes along with over 40 brands, Im not going to list them all here but you can check them here [https://www.meredith.com/](https://www.meredith.com/?fbclid=IwAR3mhyw-2QJUV0LOMKdEgVKj5pTZCNv_3rc0I1QYw3uJ1HdFgz31fTf2pK4)  

So whats the thing with MDP? It is a beaten down COVID-19 casualty stock that has made some serious progress over the last 6 months and confirmation came just last earnings. Lets go over some key figures to understand the valuation:    

Shares outstanding: 45,634,510 and these shares are in common and B class stocks as following:  Common shares: 40,565,853  B-Class shares: 5,068,657  

Share price as of pre-market Feb 26th 2021: 25,34$ (Market cap of 1,2B)    

Book Value per share: 13,375$ or P/B of 1,79 (609m$ shareholder equity)  

Cash per share: 8,3$  

Long term Debt: 2,985B$    

MDP just released its Q2-21 results (Normal company would be Q4-20) so I will be using the last 6 months as key information and try to break down the results into a normalized form as the results have been elevated quite a bit due to election cycle the data source that I use is the company 10Q available here [https://ir.meredith.com/financial-information/?section=QuarterlyResults](https://ir.meredith.com/financial-information/?section=QuarterlyResults&fbclid=IwAR2z0R_x_xQxLf8pDsNFGXraOTvkkmRAhJ3JFYOzZIiPd3yMpSfVdAfb-yc) :    

Revenue: 1,595B up \~4%  

Operating Expenses: 1,268B down \~6,6%  

EPS: 3,93 (6months)  

CFFO: 261,8m$ up \~363% 

 FCF: 249,8m$ and up quite a bit since it was bleeding cash in 2019 

So whats the catch here? Surely this is very cheap valuation however it gets interesting when we look at the earnings presentation slide 7 to be more precise: Political Advertisement H1-21 was 184m$ this with a 49% adjusted EBITDA margin translates into 90,4m$ So in order for us to have a better understanding of the 6 month figures here we must subtract this 90,4m$ from EBITDA of 344,5m$ and we get 254,1m$ of which DA expenses are 98,8m$ so we get 155,3m$ of which 20% would go to taxes and we get to 124,2m$ net earnings.  So if we do not assume any value for the political advertisement we arrive at P/E of around 10 (For 6 months earnings, and I do wish to emphasize this that we are NOT talking about 12month earnings). 

But surely people here understand that every 2 years there is a new election cycle so at least 50% of the election cycle EBITDA can be taken into account as we try to predict the future earnings power of MDP. If we do that we arrive at net earnings of 160,4m$ (Thats net earnings and EPS of 3,52$) and the P/E drops to 6,84 (Again we are talking about 6 months here...)  

Now based on my calculation I can absolutely say that this is very inexpensive (In my opinion) company especially when we take into consideration that legacy print media while shrinking, has already been surpassed by the digital media side as can be seen in the company earnings presentation slide 6.  

Now going forward into Q3-21 or Q1 for us normal people. I do not know anything except what the company stated in their latest CC and the CFO made a comment that did catch my ear and it was around 15-20minute mark of the CC. The comment went something like this ""As of the end of January we had over 450m$ in the bank"" and I do wish that you listen the call yourself if and when you are making your investment decision however to my ear that sounded like the CFO just mentioned that they generated over 71m$ in just 1 month (per share that cash generation would translate into 1,55$) now for a company thats share price is around 25$ that is a lot.   

So here is my take on the company what do you guys think?",36166,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998933613,True

2/26/21 15:26,"Update on AMC Hi everyone, one of the many apes from amc stock here and I just wanted to spend a moment to tell you guys my unsolicited opinion about whats going on with amc stocks.  Now the amc stock generally follows the same trend as gme but there are a number of factors that suggest that tomorrow (02/26/2021) could be a fantastic time for others to join in on the stock if they have any interest.

Now why would tomorrow be a good time to go in on amc?

1.) Short interest->  so the hedge funds attacked this stock super heavily today (02/25/2021) with shorts dropping it by just over 20%.  This has created a problem for the people gambling on amc stock to drop for two reasons. The first is that they are left with only 75,000 shares left total to play with tomorrow and secondly because they put AMC under ssr protection for all of 2/26/2021 which makes it increasingly difficult to continue to short the stock through tomorrow.  Now this is just one apes oppinion but if the hedges arent able to drop this stock down tommorow and all retail investors are buying and holding than I cant see why the stock wont shoot back up tommorow (I imagine most of the paper hands retail investors were scared off already by the huge dip we had today).

2.)Gamma Squeeze Potential-> So by the end of market hours tommorow there are a number of significant options expiring with the heaviest numbers starting at 8 dollars.  for example if amc ends at over 8 dollars than  61,263 options will activate equating to over 6 million shares being traded and gamma squeezing the price up by monday  (And that isnt even including all the options that activate <8).  At the moment the stock is sitting at about 7.50 and if my first point about the hedge funds is correct than 8 is a number that should be relatively easy to hit.

3.) long term value-> So should the worst situation happen and the stock plummets again tomorrow negating the chance for a gamma squeeze, than there is still value in keeping amc as a mid to long term stock.  We know that when amc diluted their shares they were able to refinance their debt with the money they gathered so bankruptcy for them is off the table through the rest of 2021.  That means they have until roughly mid 2022 to start generating profits and we all know that covid vaccinations are already starting to roll out, alongside the theatres which are starting to open up.

&#x200B;

And I just wanna end this by saying im not a financial advisor, just a random ape that has done a little DD and wants to share what I personally believe could be a good opportunity for us all to get those tendies.  Let me know what you guys think,thanks!

&#x200B;

Edit: Hey guys I really dont wanna spread misinformation so I just wanted to point out that the amc stock being worth 20$ pre covid was wrong, looks like it was actually tanking through 2019 ending at around 8 when covid hits.  Treys trades did me dirty on that fact (he's always talking about amc price pre covid D:).  Still though Im Sorry apes.

OK, so I‚Äôve been in this since the middle of January, roundabouts and I‚Äôve gotten a pretty good increase on my shares of AMC and GME especially. Still holding, and not selling.

But one thing I don‚Äôt really ever see on here is an explanation of how to sell our shares once we achieve the squeezes and reach the moon.

2/26/21 12:02,"They are trying to Margin Call Us. I think that big hedge firms are cognizant of the fact that many of us use margin to invest - which is why they‚Äôre liquidating their stocks en mass - to push the value of our accounts down as low as possible to make us liquidate so we don‚Äôt get margin called. 

... Naive, on the their part, because this only makes us thirst for more blood. 

We should try to target the stocks that they want. Maybe dividing them by sector, and mass purchasing. I do believe that American Airlines if you‚Äôre a big holder of that as it was promoted in this thread will be liquidated tomorrow in a brutal way. 

Not only did they need to liquidate to cover their shorts for NOK AMC and GME - ** but I think GME is a diversion. 

But I think they figured out that there‚Äôs a lot of new investors Who don‚Äôt have the liquidity to cover their margin in effect Destroying any and all competition that they had. Because they had an advance warning by being the cause of the crash they liquidated their stocks before everyone else had the chance to because they perform this after hours.

This is also why I think they crashed prices so steeply on Monday and only continued the downward decline harsher through the end of the week. 

Their intent after - (and I do think that stocks are going to go down more) - Is to leave a bad taste in the mouth of as many new investors as possible, and to shake out anyone who is holding GME or NOK or AMC by virtue of needing the money.

I think early to mid next week they will be buying back their shares at the rock-bottom price that they push the market to so in the end they are planning to be better off. If you have liquidity, I suggest you look at the stocks that you could never afford before, because I think they think they were stupid. In fact I know that they think that we‚Äôre stupid. Which is a fair point, however we‚Äôre so stupid that we don‚Äôt care about money. So long as we have enough to eat.

Unfortunate thing for hedgies is - their* cost-of-living is a hell of a lot higher than ours. I suggest anybody who does not hold AMC NOK GME. 

Pay close attention, and let‚Äôs figure out which stocks will be targeting next. There has to be a pattern to keep track of what they‚Äôre doing, because they seem to be doing it in collaboration - which should be securities fraud but you know how this goes. Who holds the SEC responsible for securities fraud? No one. 

>American Airlines is going to take a steep dip tomorrow, I believe, along with every other airline as well. Again, the end goal being here to margin call as many people as possible who don‚Äôt have liquidity. 

>>The SEC can suck my dick. I‚Äôve already lost 2k To Nokia in the last run but frankly I don‚Äôt give a shit so long as they are* hurting. If hedge funds are reading what I‚Äôm writing now well, speak to texting, 

This isn‚Äôt going to go well for you. We win this time no matter how much you try to put us in the red, scare us, bully us, or manipulate the market with the power that you have, we might be stupid apes, but apes together strong.

As for me, I doubled down on Nokia and AMC today I sold off some of my kriptoe (this is important pls don‚Äôt flag) at a loss, so I‚Äôm heated, but I wanted to preserve my real liquidity for when shit gets real next week. It‚Äôs not over till the fat lady sayings, and I don‚Äôt see Lizzo anywhere.

Any and all input is welcome. I‚Äôm gonna go do some pull ups. Don‚Äôt spend all your buying power just yet, if you haven‚Äôt; shit‚Äôs about to get realer - imho.

We‚Äôre reaching out to you because you have AMC options expiring this Friday and our standard sellout procedures have been adjusted to account for increased volatility in the underlying equities.

Because of this, on Friday, your AMC options expiring 2/26 may be at a higher chance than usual of being closed out if you are unable or choose not to close them out yourself.

I used deep ITM 4/16 calls on AMC to sell 2/26 calls. Since I don‚Äôt have the actual shares in my account, will they just force me to buy back my 2/26 calls?! I‚Äôm right on the line of them expiring OTM and was hoping to pocket the premium if it closes below strike. I thought that if my 2/26 calls close ITM, my 4/16 calls would just get exercised and the shares then sold to the 2/26 calls I was assigned. I have plenty of cash in the account to cover the strikes on the 4/16 calls. To play this out, do I need to exercise my 4/16 calls so the shares are in my account to prevent them from making me buy back my 2/26 calls? 

 I usually close out of options before expiry, but in this case, it may be more beneficial for me to let the 2/26 calls finish ITM and sell the shares instead of buying back the calls. The last thing i want is to lose out on profit by them making me buy back my 2/26 calls. The best outcome would be for the 2/26 calls to finish OTM, but will they rob me of that opportunity if I don‚Äôt have the actual shares in my account?

This information was made available to me by a personal friend who has a deep background in finance as well as a student at Stony Brook in NY for 3 years.

Disclaimer: I'm personally bullish on the stock just like everyone else is on this stock but I simply don't let things like ""I have a feeling it's going up"" or ""stonks only go up"" be a part of my mantra or analysis although most of you retards do.

The information I have available is from a 65 page financial and analytical report in regard to AMC that my friend made available to me that's only made available to students at Stony Brook and NYU who have access to the financial report database that accredited investors and business finance analysts regularly write in that rely heavily on the fundamental business analysis(dudes look to see if the company is good and give their opinion)

***Bullish Signals***

Figure 1: Institutional Ownership up 65% Institutions held 40.9 million shares at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional holdings in AMC Entertainment increased by 16,151,852 shares (65.3%) at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional ownership is now 71.0% of the issued capital. (**More institutional investors who are smarter than the average fuck face on WSB see fundamental/intrinsic value in a company that otherwise would go unnoticed since AMC is widely regarded as a dying company**)

Figure 2: AMC Entertainment is ranked number 9 out of 12 listed commercial services companies in the United States with a market capitalization of $523.1 million. In the commercial services companies it has the 3rd highest total assets and 2nd highest revenues.**(This information directly conflicts the bearish sentiment on most bearish analysis that AMC as far as assets and revenues doesn't do enough to stay alive from year to year)**

Figure 3: Quarterly Report (Q3/2020): November 04, 2020 Quarterly Report Analysis Q3 2020: AMC Entertainment reports 532% sequential rise in Quarterly Revenue AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), announced total revenue of $120m for the quarter-ended 30 September 2020 \[Q3/2020\], up 532.3% from the previous quarter \[Q2/2020\] and down 90.9% from the year-earlier period \[Q3/2019\]. Quarterly Report (Q3 2020) Compared with the Previous Corresponding Period \[PCP; Q3/2019\], year-over-year \[y.o.y.\] Revenue was down 90.9%. Read more in SECTION on Financials Q3 2020, FY 2019, Past 7 Years **(This information directly suggests that although AMC struggled in the past that it was making encouraging signs of growth)**

Figure 4: Rising Relative Strength: The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 81 in the NYSE market of 1,808 stocks, 273 units and 111 preference stocks which means it is beating 81% of the market. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ A price rise combined with a high relative strength is a bullish signal. ‚Ä¢ Also, the relative strength percentile is rising at 81 for 6 months, 98 for 3 months and 100 for 1 month. **(This for me IMO is the most apparent bullish signal in regard to AMC because it directly reflects the public sentiment towards the company itself & what I mean about public sentiment is institutional investors and retail traders giving the stock price substantial growth since the pandemic)**

Figure 5: The debt to equity ratio of 7.4% is under a safe benchmark figure of 50%. Moreover, it has improved from 40.1% a year ago.

Years Debt to Equity (%)

Dec 2019 7.38

Dec 2018 40.08

Dec 2017 31.54

Dec 2016 220.76

Dec 2015 130.93

**(companies should aim for a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0, meaning that the firm holds an equal balance of debt to equity. In a perfect world, though, a low debt-to-equity ratio - say, 0.30 - is better, as it indicates the firm has not accumulated a lot of debt and doesn't have to face onerous loan/credit interest payments, which is always good for the corporate bottom line. Lenders and investors tend to favor companies that demonstrate they're using less leverage and that they hold a more solid equity position.**

**Obviously, a business wants its income to exceed its liabilities. But if that doesn't happen, and debt exceeds assets, that's a big red flag for a company (especially a smaller, newer one) and could mean a company can't pay its debts.**

**That's why, when evaluating a company's overall financial health, and its debt burden, a debt to equity is a due diligence necessity for a company, and needs to be constantly measured.)**

Figure 6: Revenue growth has shown signs of recovery in recent quarters.

Jun 20 \[Q2 vs Q1\] (Revenue Growth) -98% (Net Profit Margin)-2,969.3%

**(This reiterates my observations from earlier claiming that AMC has had positive growth it still has struggled to do so.. The reason as to why is debatable for instance most people say it's because their business model is outdated and hasn't strived to innovate as far as experience & service provided)**

3/1/21 19:31,"Here's why I think $AMC is solid (long) bet Edit: TLDR $AMC 500@$8; $GME 300@$145

First things first... I don't think this really counts as DD because I'm making assumptions based on a very specific subset of data. Second, this obviously isn't financial advice, etc. Third, I'm not a bot trying to distract from $GME, I'm in $GME 300@145, I just think $AMC is worth some cash. Fourth, nothing I'm about to say has anything to do with any kind of squeeze, it's just about the market and a long position.

Now for the opinions, gross generalizations and shoddy extrapolations:

In every downturn there is (at least) one thing that has always done well, and that's film. Why? Well, in my opinion, it's because going to the movies is a relatively cheap luxury. In 2000 and 2009, people didn't stop going to the movies. AMC, for example, saw a 4% annual drop in 2008 (April-March), but bounced back up in 2009 (April-March), and there weren't very many industries which only saw a 4% drop. People who could afford $350 Blue Man Group tickets in January 2008, may not have been able to afford those tickets a year later, but they could sure afford $10 in June 2009 to go see Transformers. Cinemark (Regal) didn't even see a 08-09 dip.

Box office revenue in 2019 was $11.4bn, and it dropped 80% to $2.28bn in 2020, because this downturn is different, it's not about people not having money, it's about us not being able to be closer to each other. 

Enter vaccines. I don't know when going to the movies will feel normal again, but eventually it will, and my guess is it will be sometime before the end of 2021. Now, there's a lot of big talk about what people are gonna do as soon as they're vaccinated: trips to Bali, trips to Majorca, licking doorknobs... But who really has the funds to blow on these trips or enough doorknobs to make it worth their time? Maybe some of you gain-porn assholes on wsb (just jealous), but for everyone else who got laid off, fired or is just still struggling to survive at $40k/year, where are they gonna go? To the fucking movies, and after the last year, we're all gonna be like idiots packing into Valhalla to breathe in other people's sneezes and eat popcorn that's had 10 different hands in it.

There's a good chance that I'll be totally wrong, but I think 2022 is going to be the biggest box office year on record and AMC is the biggest player. All they have to do is hang on a little longer, and they'll slay. With that being said, the stock market is a ponzi scheme where stock price can be manipulated and is rarely linked to actual performance (see: $AMC pre-2020), but I think people are going to be thinking about and excited about going back to the movies, which will push up the value.

To those who might be thinking: but with so many streaming options, who's going to go to the movies anymore?!? I don't care how big your tv is, or how great your sound bar sounds, it's not the same as going to the movies. I don't remember very many films I watched at home as a child, but I sure as shit remember going to opening night of Batman (Keaton) with my parents, because it was an experience... The excitement, the anticipation, the murmur as the lights dim, the fun of a communal response to jump scares... You all remember being around people right? Watching movies at home is fun, but it's just not the same as a night out at the movies and a family of four can do it for ~$60. Right now, I'd pay $60 to go to the movies by myself just to feel alive again.

Anyways, you all do what you want. I'm long on $GME and I'm long on $AMC. They might pop in the next month, but I think they're gonna go up and stay up in the long run (and I'm more bullish on AMC's long term prospects than GME, until I see a new strategy). I'm not buying for the pop, I'm buying for them gainz. How many people wish they would have held their Amazon, Apple or Tesla stock beyond the pops? I'm saying this next part as much for myself as for any other ape: quit obsessing over the ticker and get back to work so you can earn more money to buy more shares... If I like the stock today (I like the stock), I'm still gonna like it next month. And remember the old saying: what one ape can do, so too can another.

Good luck everyone. Try to relax this week.

3/1/21 11:04,"Why I love the AMC Stock Sorry if my English is not the best. I'm from Germany ü§êü§£

A simple Reason why I think we should all go in AMC without nearly any cares about losses and hold it. 

The Value is very low now and we all know what's going on this time so we have a very huge chance to make a huge amount of money and even if this gamma squeeze won't happen in near future we will win or at least go out without losses.

AMC has many Cinemas around the globe and everyone loves going to the cinema. After the Covid-bullshit when they can open again with full capacity, the company can earn money again and has a good chance to grow again in long term and we all can take our money back. Maybe one month, maybe one year, who knows. 

And please remember the rumors about the corporations with Amazon and Netflix. 

That's why I use every penny I can get to buy and hold AMC until we reach the Andromeda Galaxy. 

But that's NOW. If Monday everybody starts to think like this and buy before the price reaches unrealistic dimensions to get it back, it can be a little more struggle psychologically. 

I will use the low price at this time to build out my position and enjoy this ride into the core of singularity like I've seen in the Interstellar movie. 

I'm not a financial advisor, just saying, but I'm very proud of my ape family and full of confidence and love for everyone of you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüêµü¶çüíéüëêüíéüëêüíéüëêüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",36490,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.975046754,True

3/1/21 09:25,"AMC Gamma Squeeze As a disclaimer, I did not partake in the initial AMC or GME or any meme stock rally from January, and I am not bagholding any positions from that rally. I bought into AMC 3/12 15Cs on Thursday and Friday because of what I noticed.

First we'll start with a brief description of what a gamma squeeze is. Long story short, all it is is there are a lot of calls that were bought, and those call options are ITM and are either expiring and/or being exercised, which forces the stock price to go higher as options writers now need to cover their position. [https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze](https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze) is an article that explains it in depth.

On Thursday 2/25, from about 2:23PM EST to 2:40PM EST, I saw a HUGE influx of AMC call options being bought, nearly $5.6M worth of call options, the total number of contracts bought was 22,740 contracts, were bought in a 17 minute time frame. I had never seen such activity in my life. This is where things get interesting. 15,539 out of the 22,740 total options were AMC 2/26 6.5Cs. The remaining 7,201 contracts were AMC 2/26 7Cs. 

Here is a breakdown of the orders:

**AMC 2/26 6.5C**

Total Premium Paid: $3,971,000

Total Size: 15,539 contracts

Right to purchase: 1,553,900 shares @ 6.5 per share for a total cost of $10,100,350

**AMC 2/26 7C**

Total Premium Paid: $1,582,000

Total Size: 7,201 contracts

Right to purchase: 720,100 shares @ 7 per share for a total cost of $5,040,700 

Immediately I thought that AMC was going to have an EOD rally and that these weeklies would print insane and that's why they came in with such volume in such a small time frame, but I was wrong, there wasn't any EOD rally. This kinda shocked me, because who would buy millions of dollars worth of weeklies in such a manner if it wasn't for a day trade? But then it hit me, these were all very ITM calls, and ALL these orders came in as **split orders**. For those who don't know what a split order is, it is a type of order for large securities transactions that is divided into smaller orders and it is done to prevent large fluctuations in the market price. [https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:\~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security](https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security). is article if you are interested in learning more about split orders. This is when it hit me, holy shit, these calls HAD to be bought to be exercised!! Why in the world would there be such large buyers, within such a small time frame, buy so many ITM weekly calls, \*and the cherry on top\* as split orders just to stop the market price from fluctuating then and there? GAMMA SQUEEZE THAT'S WHY.

And this is where I wrap this up folks. AMC is still one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, and AMC still has been extremely active in terms of share volume on a daily basis. On top of that, NYC movie theaters open up again next month too, which is fundamentally great for AMC. AMC had very heavy call buying for the 6.5Cs and 7Cs all week, with more volume being concentrated in the 6.5Cs, and AMC closed well above this on Friday (AMC closed at 8.20 to be exact). Those calls were most likely bought to be exercised, so many shorts have to cover or did already cover. This should propel AMC stock price this week, hopefully forcing an insane gamma squeeze.

**TLDR:** On 2/25 big boys bought a crap ton, millions of dollars worth, of AMC 6.5 and 7 weekly calls in literally 17 minutes via split orders, and these calls were likely to be exercised. AMC closed well above 6.5, where most of the call volume was, and because they expired ITM those contracts will be exercised and a crap ton of shares was bought squeezing those option writers and forcing them to cover, in such a manner that we should see an epic gamma squeeze this week.",36502,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999655724,True

3/1/21 00:56,"AMC ""BULL TRAP"" Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".

Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC & GME to be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.

Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT & DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?

Example:

On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".

I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.

""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""

The approval of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.

A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.

Seems like an appropriate play to talk about in the bets forum because of the risk involved. If its played short because a bunch of people bought the wrong ticker then great, puts and shorts will print.

In order for the cup to complete, the price needs to rise above the neckline, which is about $10-11 area.  If this happens, chartists and algo buyers will see the buy signal and volume should come in.

What time period are we looking at?  I'd say we have till Friday to get it to the neckline.  If enough contracts are executed Monday, we could see enough volume to get there.

There's also the issue of the gap to fill from the sell off from Feb 2.  The area ranges from $10-$15, giving us further reason for an increase in price.  If we do, the breakout in price should occur from there.

2/28/21 09:13,"When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next. I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.

By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.

Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/

First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! 

Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. 

Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. 

By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.

Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.

When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.

UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!

Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.

TLDR: 

* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU

- stop trying to force people to buy certain stocks. This sub has has been about sharing what you know, and helping others benefit. It is not a cult mentality. Every time stock is going down, people are crying with, hold. Every investor(cough: gambler) will decide what makes most sense for them. You are just polarizing.
- I have nothing against AMC but AMC and GME are not in same bucket. One of them has shitty management, diluted shares significantly and trying to f over their investors. Other one is trying to transform itself. One has huge short interest, other is?
- The battle here is between Hedge funds against other hedge funds, as it always has been. Look at the volume. Retail is support at best. Have an entry and exit point, ignore what people say here.

As for me, I like the stock and community evolving around it. As long as GME stays above 20$, I know this is not over. Hell if it drops yo that level, why would I sell anyways. So either to the moon or earth‚Äôs core.

I was one of the retards that bought it thinking to sell it immediately for a profit. I got greedy and held like a cuck. I finally sold my last remaining shares yesterday at open at 4.33. It closed today at 3.92.

I'm pretty pessimistic on this stock not because i lost money but because i actually looked into it AFTER buying the stock.

Many bagholders are hoping for dividend to be reinstated, but i don't think that's going to happen. They have 5.67 billion outstanding shares in NYSE. Not counting European shares, it'll cost them 56.7 million dollars for every penny they reinstate in dividend. This is at a time when they lost 2.6 billion and is looking to lose some more this year. They are also looking to regain market share, so they'll likely undercut competitors on pricing as well. Keep in mind, it's the Finnish that is running this company...Fins have been very conservative in spending.

Not only that...they also have inferior technology. Look at the contracts they're winning in. It's all poor countries/companies that can't afford or don't want to afford what Samsung/Ericsson/Huawei...etc. has to offer. Yes, they did have a NASA contract, but that's only worth $14 million over a few years. Peanuts.

It's going to be a tough few years ahead. I don't know of any potential catalysts. They'll be hard at work on improving their technology while gaining whatever market share they can get a hold of.

2/27/21 07:56,"Why I bought OSK stock - DD Oshkosh Truck Corp (**OSK**) might be a stock that many of you know about currently as they just won a huge contract to build the USPS next generation delivery vehicle fleet. Day of announcement I watched the stock rocket up almost 25% in a matter of an hour or so. Over the past week it has given most of this back. I missed the rocket ride because I didn't have funds available that weren't tied up in other things. (To be clear, if I had funds avail, I would have day traded that action. I caught the news when the price was still under $109. I would have paperhanded likely around $120. I'm now talking about a solid 1 to 3 month play here after taking the time to do some research. This isn't about riding another rocket).

With AMC taking a mini moon shot this week I jumped out for tendie nuggets near the high, and moved that all into **OSK**. I bought into AMC planning to hold it for months if need be because to me it seemed a very safe play with a good return potential. I was right sooner than expected. I will buy back in if it dips enough, but for now, I see **OSK** as the same safe play with good earnings potential.

Lets break down why I believe **OSK** will be good to anyone who invests now. Open up its chart and take a look at what you see. You can look at 1mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, 1y or 5y, and you get the same picture. A consistent upward climb. The 5y chart has some up and downs more than the last year; There are a few corrections when the stock gained faster than it's overall average (and then there is the pandemic ""crash"" that every stock dealt with). It's always rebounded and continued the climb. Last year the price doubled. With so many positive factors right now for **OSK** business, I don't see reason to believe it can't do the same again this year.

I fully expect the price to be up 20-25% within 3 months. This USPS contract is huge and I believe it will lead to an overall faster rise than the average trend line. Somewhere down the road I'd expect a correction as the price overinflates. I intend to ride the wave for now and exit long before that happens. Aside from the USPS contract, **OSK** is still a reliable company with solid and knowledgeable leadership.

If you look back thru their news history you don't see negative news. You see again and again awards for most admired company, accolades for being a highly sustainable company, Most ethical, etc. etc. In between those awards news, there is large contract and large contract to military and government. They are well known and well trusted. That's why they win contracts and why they keep winning contracts. They are leading the way with EV trucks and work vehicles, and with Biden pushing to move the USA away from fossil fuels and meet (the newly rejoined) Paris climate accord goals, I only see more demand for **OSK** to produce, supply, and retrofit EV vehicles in the future.

So let me just recap and add other strong bullet points not included thus far:\* Consistent and reliable upward momentum.\* Strong financial health and low debt ratio.\* Highly respected and awarded company.\* Excellent company leadership.\* Highly competitive, if not preferred, supplier for gov't contracts.\* P/E ratio (\~23x) is well below their industry average.\* Earnings growth forecast is >20% ( I believe this is overly conservative actually).

Looking at options, just an example that caught my eye is a 2021/07/16c $105 for 12.60. That would make the break even price just $117.60 - I would be a little amazed if within 140 days **OSK** isn't above $120 minimum. $117.60 is on the low, low end of the price projection. Another gov't contract award or positive news and it's easy to see the stock jump over $140. Even without any news I'm expecting it to cross $125 within 60 days. Increased gov't spending, increased stimulus, the country getting back to work post COVID, increased demand for their products, the list goes on. It seems a smoothly paved and open road ahead for **OSK**, and they seem well positioned to take advantage of it.

I went into get tested for Covid this afternoon after being exposed, nothing special. But I'm also buying dips on AMC at the same time and as a result, almost missed my name being called multiple times by the receptionist when my turn was ready. Tunnel vision is real.

I get the swab and chat with the doc for a minute or two about all the Covid craziness and just overall life shit.

I'm chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I'm still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results. I didn't realize he could see the basic idea of what I was doing on my phone (price-watching etc) and as he passes me, I hear him say, ""Niiiiiice.""

Being in the exam room and awaiting my results, I chime in with, ""Oh sweet, I'm negative?"" He responds with, ""Nah, I saw the stonks on your phone. Good luck, retard."" There's a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he's here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.

2/27/21 05:43,"Reddit volatility - Regulation Change 
Everywhere you look there are people calling for changes in regulations of some form or another due to this reddit frenzy. I just read this morning that the EU is looking to regulate, and here, ideas such as a stock tax have been floated.

Every idea I‚Äôve seen has one thing in common: to hurt the little guy. Most of these organizations and politicians pushing their agenda say they side with the little guy and acknowledge the negative impact HVs have gotten away with - but there is no talk of regulating them.

The GameStop frenzy (and AMC, BB etc), is blowback. Not blowback from what the hedges are doing, or what politicians are doing, but blowback from a concerted attack on the little guy. It‚Äôs like, really hard to make consistent profits in the stock market, and the harder it is, the more we run to daddy hedge funds to do it for us. They control the prices through manipulation - short ladder attacks, naked shorting, after hours and premarket games, to box us out and disenfranchise us. 

If we are looking for a solution for this volatile environment, I have one. PDT rule changes. All of the talk about what hedge funds are doing, and yet it‚Äôs legal. The only reason it‚Äôs legal is because we CAN‚ÄôT do it. There is a long list of things hfs can do that we can‚Äôt. 

The pdt rule puts one more enormous barrier in our way. We are forced to strategize around it. Instead of taking a reasonable risk/reward ratio, PDT encourages to do highly risky things like buying to hold overnight or not selling a losing position because the losses to take are smaller than your gains your eyeing but can‚Äôt risk violating PDT.

If this movement results in reduction of clearing times for transactions and re-evaluating how PDT is factored, it‚Äôll be a small success. To be successful as a trader, we are fighting so many things, and increasingly I‚Äôve realized that the majority of my decisions are being made to not violate PDT. This far this week, I‚Äôve noticed PDT strategy has resulted in ALL of my big losses. Who does it really serve?

Instead of PDT being 3 open/close positions a week, why not consider requirements on percentage of account size, or increasing the limit to keep up with the incredible increase in retail traders. The only way to ensure the success of the little guy is to remove the obstacles that are already in place. We can‚Äôt remove the obstacles the hfs put in place, but a change in PDT would return retail traders to making more ‚Äòlogical‚Äô decisions that aren‚Äôt being made in order to stay in compliance with a biased anti-retail rule.",36873,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.931598544,True

2/27/21 04:30,"PSA: AMCX is not up because of AMC Tl;dr AMCX is a very undervalued company based on EV/EBITDA and SOTP valuations and just had a very bullish earnings call. It's not up because of confusion on the name.

I've been seeing a lot of confusion about why AMCX is up so much today, many people on StockTwits incorrectly believe it's because there's confusion about AMCX vs. AMC. In it of itself that doesn't matter, but people are talking about shorting AMCX because they think it's being purchased by intended AMC buyers and I don't want to see you guys lose your money.

AMCX had a really bullish earnings report and exceeded expected earnings by a significant portion. However, the true important news was that AMCX's streaming platforms hit a combined 6m users. Looking at comps, niche streaming platforms tend to be valued at $200 per user, which would mean those streaming platforms are worth $1.2B on top of the legacy company, which is where the majority of earnings are coming from. They're also projecting 20m-25m users by 2025, which would result in a $4B-$5B valuations on its streaming platforms alone.

Basically, you have a company trading at 3xEV/EBITDA where the streaming platforms make up a small portion of that EBITDA. Basically, if you treat the streaming platforms' earnings and value as being worth 0 dollars, you're buying into a business generating 3.25xEV/EBITDA (which is very low). Factoring back in the value of the streaming platforms, you're looking at a significantly undervalued business.

I'm not saying people should buy into AMCX, but it would be foolhardy to short it. You saw how things ended up being for people who shorted GME when it was also a value stock. If y'all end up shorting it I'd be more than happy to double down :) I wish my initial investment had been bigger.

3/3/21 02:30,"How to long Breaking Bad. AMCX fundamentals turnaround story. Potential short/gamma squeeze. AMCX has high potential for a short squeeze, \~50% of float is short and moving up, currently at resistance but not selling off. No one is selling which is bad news for bears.

Conditions are right:

**1) Covering is imminent:**  majority of short positions are red since chart is at a 5 year high and is moving higher

**2) Fundamentals** are in an uptrend. Pivot  to streaming turnaround story is real and the numbers are showing it. They just had a big earnings EPS beat are getting price target upgrades.

**3) Value:** AMC networks is responsible for the best show ever create IMO (Breaking Bad) so that is certainly saying something. Breaking Bad is basically about a man fed up with trying to make it in this fucked up crony capitalism experiment we have going. What better a way to put your money where your mouth is than to long the stock that got so many people thinking about this. Do not underplay the cultural changes that Breaking Bad and other AMC content (Mad Men) have brought to our society. WTF were people even talking about before breaking bad, CSI Miami?

**4) Technicals:** Chart tells me it is currently in the process of squeezing on low volume, if/when volume picks up and attention is brought to this ticker and option volume picks up a gamma squeeze will just add rocketfuel.

**5) Short Data:** My rough estimate of current total short shares is 8.7M (if the data available to retail traders can be trusted, Yahoo Finance, SCANZ), that is \~$600M (at $70 share price) of short positions which will need to be bought back if this keeps going up. 17M float is what my data is telling me (SCANZ). Daily $volumes are way below $100M atm and shorts just keep adding more. Please tell me what I am wrong about cause I am not well versed in this type of data.

AMCX as a company has aired some of the best media content ever created by humans, they are a legitimate undervalued play, they are pivoting their business model and streaming numbers are growing fast. Anyone who thinks a vaccine is somehow going lessen the amount of TV people are watching needs to give their head a shake. A company with this potential should not have a \~50% short float which means it is realistically setup for a short squeeze if shorts refuse to cover their red positions and continue to average down. Likely this was at one point in time a good short play but the fundamentals have changed and so has the chart, all the while with shorts refusing to stop out cover. I will be continuing to pay attention to short numbers as this plays out.

I would love to hear anyone's thoughts on this. Also remember to go easy on me cause I am retarded and this is definitely not a suggestion to buy, I just want to be shown how I am wrong so that I don't yolo on this play. I have a small position and will add a bunch more if some of you autists can confirm that I am not wrong here.

**TL;DR** if you ever wanted to long breaking bad, now is the time.

Roblox is a free to play game that has been around since 2006 while the company started in 2004. It has 199 million monthly users, more than Minecraft.  https://backlinko.com/roblox-users#roblox-monthly-active-users 
https://www.businessofapps.com/data/roblox-statistics/ 

Games and worlds are created by Roblox developers, which can be anyone due to the fact developers are individuals and you get paid based on how much your game or world is played. Roblox has created a game developer community. We all know Roblox because we or a niece or nephew have played it. March 10th is the day Roblox will be out on the NYSE as the ticker RBLX. 

Why March 10th could be a big opening day

Roblox is supposed to open on the market at 
$41.52 per share. I believe the stock will go anywhere from $50-$80 in the day due to the fact that it is a) already known b) good fundamentals c) stocks for entering the NYSE tend to rocket (ex.MORF) d) it has more active users than any game e) meme stock. If we‚Äôve learned anything in the past month it‚Äôs that meme stocks like GME, AMC, and NOK may be memes but they can make us money. I think of RBLX as a smaller meme stock. Although the CEO is big on long term, always speaking in 5,10,15 year increments, nobody invests into a kids mobile game long term. That‚Äôs why I think after the peak, people will take profit and leave. Don‚Äôt stay in too long. 

Why Roblox wasn‚Äôt enlisted in the NYSE earlier like planned 

They have in game currency which now can be a monthly subscription bringing in even more revenue. Roblox was initially suppose to enlist in the NYSE earlier but ‚Äúbecause of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's scrutiny of how the video game platform recognizes revenue in its finances, according to a memo the company sent to employees on Thursday.‚Äù https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/29/sec-scrutiny-delays-roblox-stock-market-listing.html 
The reason for this delay was due to the immense increase in revenue from their monthly round subscription. What RBLX deemed as revenue and the SEC differed, halting them to redo their financials. 

Why Roblox is a good company 

Roblox Global Player Spending has almost doubled from 65.2M in January 2020 to 102.9M in May 2020. So imagine how much it has increased since then now in February 2021. 
Roblox Valuation has doubled from 2.5B in 2018 to 4B in 2020. In May 2020 Roblox was the 3rd highest grossing game in mobile games. They have 3 billion total engagement hours each month. Since 2017 annual revenue has gone from 45.7M to in 2019 435M.

# Introduction

Over  the past month, I've been researching stock prospects that I can buy  into for 2021. The pandemic hit everything really hard, and now we are  looking at a potential recovery going into 2021. We saw a huge dip in  the market last week despite **GME** and **AMC**  surging big-time. We've been watching the market do a ton of swings,  with Marijana stocks surging briefly, then dying off, and now there's  been a huge sell-off in the Tech sector--I believe because the market is  transitioning to the Travel sector and not necessarily because of anything fundamentally wrong with the Tech sector.

Coincidentally,  I've also been doing a lot of research into the housing market because I  am looking to move this year into a new home, thanks to the blessing of a well-paying job that allowed me to work from home throughout the pandemic. I noticed some significant trends and parallels with major,  historic economic events that are going to change the landscape of our  economy for decades. In summary, I believe we are on the cusp of a new house market collapse that will mirror and possibly overshadow what we experienced in the 2008 Sub Prime Mortgage crisis.

If you are a well-versed ape who knows their shit when it comes to the  American housing market and how it affects the economy, feel free to skip all this history and go find the stock picks that you can start drawing your green crayon charts with.

# Great Depression & and the Covid 2019 pandemic

**This part is going to be a long analysis on past events on the history of  American Economy in support of this analysis. If you don't care about it  or already know, skip it.**

The most significant economic event in US history was The Great Depression (GD) which began in 1929. Most people don't really understand the real cause.  The main trigger of the GD was that growing industries at  that time which focused on the manufacturing of cheap goods and had historically (at that time) performed really well, were suddenly starting to suffer from consumer lag, meaning nobody was buying their products. Despite this, stocks in many consumer goods and luxuries continued to rise, and the ""Roaring Twenties"" had an overwhelming feeling of optimism. The average debt of American citizens was rising as we began to widely adopt a culture of buying on credit, something we still do heavily today. When people fall into debt, they tighten their belts and stop buying frivolously in order to save money for the essentials.

The Crash finally happened on ""Black Tuesday"" because Wall Street realized that the optimism of the market was no longer feasible, and began selling off shares in huge numbers. Margin buyers (those who buy stocks on credit)  snapped up the ""opportunity"" and basically borrowed the shares with money they could not afford.

Suddenly,  on October 29th, the floor fell out beneath the entire market, and anyone buying on margin was completely wiped out. Consumer debt went through the roof, and everyone scrambled to pull their money out of the banks in order to hold onto what cash they had ... all on the same day.

The banks' vaults were completely wiped out, and when people could not withdraw their money because there was none to withdraw, and the banks could not call in on the debts of people because the banks themselves had no funds to transfer. The entire economy collapsed instantly.  Companies could not afford to buy materials on credit, meaning they could not do business. Businesses closed, and hundreds of thousands of  Americans became jobless overnight, and this was only in the first few months. Homelessness became rampant as hundreds of thousands of  Americans defaulted on their mortgages in the following years. This will be important later.

# How the Covid Pandemic Compares to the Great Depression

**The Covid Pandemic is an exact replica of the events preceding the GD**, but simply masked by different causes. Because of the Covid Pandemic, over 500,000 Americans are dead, mostly seniors, and [unemployment has completely skyrocketed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R46554.pdf) beyond 14.8% (as of April 2020), though it finally calmed down to roughly 6.7%, though the accuracy of that information is shakey at best because it does not include people who have stopped looking for jobs or have fallen out of the sight of the statistics because they have been rendered homeless.

**The  Covid 19 pandemic essentially triggered a massive and instantaneous halt on consumer spending because so many Americans have lost their jobs--the same trigger that caused the GD. The reason this has not led to a complete collapse of the economy is because of two reasons:**

1. **The  Stimulus Package released last year was almost entirely directed towards businesses in order to prop up the economy. Despite the fact that 20% of Americans are delinquent on rent, and 32% of Americans are late on mortgage payments a vast majority of the stimulus went into businesses and investors that would inject the money into the stock market.**
2. **The moratorium on rent, federal student loans, and mortgage payments, has given Americans a brief respite to recover in the wake of an unprecedented unemployment crisis as a direct result of the pandemic. The money from the stimulus SHOULD have gone to these individuals so they could pay their rent and utilities to avoid an inevitable housing crisis, this action is basically a crutch holding up Americans while they accumulate a massive amount of debt on rent and utilities that they will never be able to pay back. When the moratorium ends, it will be a complete catastrophe.**

# Crawling out of depression via mortgages and bonds

**Skip this if you don't care about how important mortgages and bonds are to the US economy**

The US in the 1930s under Franklin D. Roosevelt took massive steps to rebuild the American economy using Mortgages as the foundation of it. [The Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowners_Refinancing_Act)  enabled the American public to secure their homes by using the federal government as the backer for thousands of mortgages, which guaranteed financial security for the banks. This allowed the banks to give the average American the credit to afford a home and secure employment with affordable refinancing. By the mid 1930s, 20% of urban America successfully refinanced their homes, and the depression began making its turn-around. Basically, all of America now relies on mortgages as a sign of economic health, which became the start of the real ""American Dream"" of owning a home in the 1950s and persists today.

Another way we crawled out was because of US Treasury Bonds, and *ironically* thanks to World War II. Selling bonds is how the US Treasury builds capital to fund huge policies. The prime example of this was the mass sale of **War Bonds** during World War II, which **helped contribute to our pulling out of the GD**. As soon as we went to war in 1941, [more than 80 million Americans purchased war bonds to bring in $180 Billion in revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warbonds.asp) instantaneously.

# What is a bond? How does it work?

Bonds are essentially an investment in the US government and are generally considered safe. When you buy a 5 year bond say at $100 at a 2% yield,  the bond pays you back 2 dollars for each year you hold the bond. Bonds are ""generally"" safe because they don't lose their value; however, in cases where inflation goes through the roof, bonds ""lose"" money because inflation outpaces the rate of return on the bond. If in 2 years, inflation rises by 6% when the rate of return of my bond is 2%, then I  basically lost 2 dollars in the exchange of my bond. This usually doesn't happen, and supposedly American inflation is secure, but that remains to be seen.

In any case, when bonds are the better pick, the stock market usually halts, which is what happened back during World War II; however, this was because America pulled together to fight what they believed to be the greatest evil of their time. Even Wall Street got a piece of it, and because of that historical trend, when bonds go up, stocks go down. The reason this happens is that when bond yields go up significantly, investors tend to choose bonds because they are safer. That being said, the market reaction to the bond yield rising is pure speculation and unlikely to indicate the market is failing *so far*, but it DOES signal what the US Government is trying to do.

Recently, the stock market has been flying high because of the monetary injections from the stimulus. Everyone is feeling REALLY excited, or they have been up until recently. The market took a HUGE dip on Thursday  (25th) as a result of news that US Treasury Bonds had increased their yield percentage.

# The problem with bonds today and the economic debt situation

Confidence in the US Government is generally not good right now. Our situation today is very different from 1941. Presently, civil unrest for different reasons which we are all aware, have divided the nation, and the response from the government has not inspired much confidence.

That being said, bond sales are *extremely unlikely* to be as steady, or voluminous as they were in 1941, and that is going to force the Treasury to act more drastically in raising the yields. The stock market is going to suffer for it, probably, but more than anything the American Government is going to be setting itself up for disaster.

The US Government is increasing yields on bonds because they are preparing for an inevitable disaster where they are going to need massive amounts of capital to cover the American public when this housing crisis occurs. They would prefer to cover this expense with domestic capital rather than getting loans from its economic partners. That is because they have seen this before, but now we have the knowledge of history and the signals of an impending crisis. I mean... hell, it's obvious at this point.

The reason is that America is going to have to print HUGE amounts of money to pay back the bonds that are bought with what I think are historically higher yields than we've ever seen before. This will drive up inflation, but it would not increase the US Debt. I believe that as a result, the US government may put in a situation where it must pay huge sums of money in order to prop up the economy as we go through the upcoming crisis, they are going to do what they have always done...

*Borrow borrow borrow*

We borrow money, mainly from European allies and China. This is having a detrimental effect on the world's confidence in America's economy, and it is likely going to fall out eventually. In a worst-case scenario, China may call upon America to pay back its debt, though it is unlikely because it would hurt their economy significantly as well.

Nevertheless, China is now the forerunner of the world economy, having completely overshadowed the global market in consumer goods and manufacturing industries. They are also surging ahead in tech and healthcare/pharmaceuticals--historically US-based industries. I don't necessarily believe China would demand a payback when we couldn't possibly do it, they *may* refuse to loan more to the USA, and that will be the trigger of the crisis which I'm about to explain.

# Parallels to the Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession

**For those of you who have seen ""The Big Short"" or studied the 2008 Financial Crisis and know about this, feel free to skip.**

From 2000 to 2006, because of some highly unscrupulous actions taken by mortgage-lending banks, huge banks like Morgan Stanley and Lehman (which collapsed) accumulated a massive amount of uncovered risk in the form of ""Collateralized Debt Obligations"" or CDOs. A [CDO](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032315/were-collateralized-debt-obligations-cdo-responsible-2008-financial-crisis.asp)  is basically a package of loans that pays back premiums to investors. In the case of the 2008 mortgage crisis, lending banks were selling massive amounts of extremely poor quality or ""Sub Prime Loans"" to people who they knew were highly likely to default (fail to pay the mortgage and lose their house). The housing market was in a huge bubble because small and mid-sized banks were willing to lend INSANE sums of money for people to buy houses. These banks would then bundle up the sub-prime loans along with really good or safe loans, known as AAA (Triple-A) or Prime mortgages. The small banks would then sell these packages of loans for huge, lump sums to the big banks, who would assume control of the interest and premium payments in the form of a CDO, but the CDO would be marked as AAA-rated despite being made up of more than 14% of B-rated mortgages or worse.

Banks continued to do this en-masse, bundling huge amounts of bad loans, until they made up more than 14% of the CDO packages. We're talking BILLIONS of dollars in horrendous, subprime mortgages that were almost guaranteed to fail.

By mid-2007, defaults on loans were through the roof, and more than 14% of the loans in these CDOs were in default. People were losing their homes en-masse, and yet banks continued this terrible lending practice. Some investors took notice and began buying up short positions known as ""[Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp)"" (CDS) on these bad loans. A CDS is basically like buying insurance against a default, meaning that if the majority of these mortgages defaulted, the person who shorted them would earn a massive payout the same way you are paid insurance if your home burns to the ground.

The combination of overwhelming mortgage defaults along with the massive sums of short positions taken up against the American Housing market and the banks that facilitated it completely bankrupted some banks. In the aftermath, the stock market plummeted, bank and hedge fund managers were among over 5,000 new suicides in 2009 in the wake of the disaster that ruined them and their clients financially. The US government was forced to step in and bail out big banks like Morgan Stanley, AIG, and many others in order to prevent a total economic collapse.

As you might have guessed, average Americans never saw a penny of it. Millions of people lost their homes, jobs, and their lives. It was an instantaneous and disastrous crisis that only could be compared to the GD, despite how brief it was.

We are now facing an identical, inevitable, and exponentially worse scenario by September 2021...

# How the market is going to collapse by September (without intervention)

As I mentioned in my references above, over 32% of home-owners and 20% of renters in America are delinquent on payments. Banks are already feeling the pinch because nobody is making payments, but the government has forced them to eat it and say ""tough shit"" until the pandemic is over. [The losses are astronomical](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/833920538/americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-chase-prepares-for-massive-round-of-defaults).

How  I feel personally about these banks is irrelevant, and I do think they are evil incarnate, the fact that nobody can pay their mortgages is a REALLY BAD THING. The problem is that the government only told banks they can't force anyone to pay, nobody can be evicted, and yet the debt continues to grow.

**Without intervention, this is what is going to happen...**

When the moratorium on ~~mortgages and~~ rent finally goes, the American economy is going to collapse under the weight of displaced residents, and the stock market will see a massive pullback from the economic burden. Due to evictions, they won't be able to qualify for mortgages or homes, and rent qualifications will be just as shaky. The end-result is pretty much identical to what we saw in 2008 in terms of debt to income ratio, and the lack of secured housing for millions of Americans. Wall Street and the banks  are doing everything they can to hedge against their inevitable losses from this, but when the defaults finally happen, we can expect more than  [9% of Americans to default](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-speculative-grade-default-rate-seen-rising-to-9-by-september-2021-8211-s-p-61424480)

>**Edit note:** I did not correctly interpret forbearance and debt accumuluation. I have come to realize that mortgage forbearance allowed home-owners to cease all payments and defer them entirely. This protection only applies to home-owners though. Renters do not have this protection, and are expected to pay back their debts in full. I still believe that many home owners on B, BB, and BBB-rated loans may have their backs broken by the pandemic regardless and still default on their mortgages. Defaults are still very high, and without intervention, this will break the back of the US economy. Thanks to the degenerates who pointed this out to me.

Unless billions of dollars are injected into the banks in order to cover their losses, on the condition that all delinquent American home owners and renters are COMPLETELY FORGIVEN, this is inevitable, and it is already affecting us.

# What the housing market is doing now and what is about to happen

The housing market has been a ""seller's market"" bubble since May. I know, because I sold my last home at a 45% profit, despite the pandemic in September. I have been looking for a new home to move out of state since December while renting an affordable apartment to accumulate money for a down payment.

While doing my research on homes to move to, I watched houses in the area I was hoping to move drop by an average of 20% in asking price since January. Most American home owners aren't stupid, they know what is coming, and they know they won't be able to pay.

As of December, housing inventory was 1.06 Million homes, down from 1.5 Million in June. Everyone is currently saying ""We're running out of homes"" which has been driving the prices of homes and number of mortgages higher than ever at historically low-interest rates. In the last month, home construction costs being at relatively low prices depending on the area) have allowed property developers, especially on the west coast and rural America to build massive amounts of single and multi-family homes averaging over $400,000 with a 15% profit margin on building costs. Land development and realty companies are looking to take advantage of the seller's market, thinking that they can build enough homes in time to sell at record-high prices. All this sounds like great things for the housing market, but it's about to all come to an end.

>***Edit Note***\*: I made statements here which implied that construction costs on new houses were down for everyone. This is not true for the average home buyer, but\* ***might*** *be true for* ***development companies*** *in areas with easy access to lumber (such as OR, WA, CA, ID, etc). I was misled based on new-home costs in these states, which have easy access to cheap lumber, despite the downturn, and new homes are being built in massive numbers. I appreciate those who pointed this error out to me.* [Some data I was linked](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST)

According to [Black Knight](https://www.blackknightinc.com/blog-posts/slowdown-in-rate-of-forbearance-improvement/), 5.2% of mortgages are in forbearance pending the end of the pandemic protections with a total of 2.7M homes facing default when the forbearance ends. ~~Every one of those people is going to be expected to pay back absolutely everything as soon as the moratorium ends~~ *~~in full~~*~~.~~

**Edit**

>This statement was inaccurate. Mortgage payback is being deferred to the end of loans. This does not apply to renters. Defaults are stil high, and my opinion on a crash remains the same.

The current numbers of new homes on the market is not out as of today, but based on the rate of increase from Zillow, showing an average 13.4% increase in house prices since January to December 2020, and now watching as the collective price of homes suddenly plummeted by 20% on the searches I have done, I see a flood before the comet strikes and they are forced to default. The simultaneous increased home construction and the flood of homes from Americans trying to get out is going to lead to a sudden rise of (I believe) more than 3 million homes. This is going to cause housing prices to plummet, and they already are, ahead of any data or news.

For those Americans too slow or unwilling to sell and cannot pay, eviction is the only alternative. Foreclosures will flood the market, and banks will be forced to auction at dramatically lower prices in order to avoid losing their investments to weather damage as the houses sit empty for months or years.

This will force banks to compensate their losses with higher interest rates. Variable-rate mortgages will feel the squeeze the hardest, and homeowners who were once paying 3% will, in another 2 years, likely see their mortgage interest increase significantly over time. People who are still facing struggles in a post-pandemic America will likely be forced to surrender their homes, but they will get no relief from renters, as they have been put in the same boat as the banks but without any hope of government support, as they are privately owned entities that have much less impact on the economy.

Due to the rent crisis that we are already witnessing unfold, I predict landlords will be forced to raise rent prices to recover their losses from the forbearance. Worse, many will be forced to sell their property because they have their own bills to pay and no income to do so. When rent becomes impossibly high, mortgages are unobtainable, home-owners are forced to refinance at insane rates of interest, and the market inevitably floods with more homes at prices running away to near-worthlessness.

# How in the F-ing hell does ANY of this awfulness have to do with stock market DD!?

**This is the section you've been waiting for**

The pandemic has financially crippled the American economy, and the stimulus package that was released is currently propping everything up. In the end, I'm expecting the housing market to crash VERY Hard. However, unlike Michael Burry, I'm taking up long positions in what I believe are going to be very important businesses that will provide the necessities for Americans as the crisis unfolds.

1. **Moving and Storage companies - CUBE UHAL EXR**

When people are forced to move, the first thing they have to do is collect their belongings and put them somewhere. This crisis is going to force Americans to move out of their homes and apartments en-masse, and it's going to be an absolute brutal disaster. I believe that people are already getting ahead of this by selling off their homes, and they will start putting their stuff into places they can afford, mobile or climate-controlled storage units.

I want to be clear, the idea of this is utterly depressing to me... but the first stock that is going to skyrocket ahead of the market downturn is moving companies, and storage units. U-Haul, owned my Amerco, does both, and they have packaged deals. The company has done nothing but made stupid money since it was founded post WW2. But in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis and in the 6 years after it ended, Uhaul made INSANELY STUPID money.

&#x200B;

[Amerco\/UHAL stock analysis & historical performance \(1995-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/qlvlfmamfik61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e1d14b30c267551414bc1a6be8b57944ce5e5d)

Besides Amerco/UHAL, EXR (Extra Space Storage) and CUBE (CubeSmart) are both making huge moves in the market and despite being in direct competition,  typically keep to their own respective areas of the nation where they do the most business. Because of this, they don't steal each other's clients. Being national companies, they offer much better rates, on average, than private/family owned storage facilities.

Since  UHAL is the only company on this list old enough to have been a  national brand at the time of the 2008 crisis, it is the only real litmus test I have pulled up for how the market will react and how they will make their money. Because CUBE is much cheaper, I have thrown my bets on them, and I anticipate good news on Monday.  


>**Edit:**  
Monday was a sell-off after CUBE beat earnings, and my calls dipped due to dividend-whores. Outlook is still very bullish.

[My positions disclosure as of 3\/2 \(couldn't get off RH yet\)](https://preview.redd.it/g7sce0l0hnk61.jpg?width=655&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=048f2078c6f0ab2937ec5dd93f478943930482b9)

CUBE announced earnings this weekend, and I'm anticipating the price to rise sharply on good announcements that they strongly outpaced their earnings once the transcripts go public. At any point they dip, I have every intention to start buying up stocks, even if my calls expire worthless. This is a very LONG play, and I do not advise anyone to copy my trades unless you have the capital to spare. Just like UHaul in the wake of the pandemic, they dipped HARD, but after their latest earnings announcement, absolutely blew through the roof.

Options on CUBE are cheap right now, and I am willing to throw $800 down on that bet. Even if CUBE only goes up by $1 per share after earnings are public, that's break-even for me. I'm also expecting that other investors are going to get behind this trend and start buying up shares in these sectors as well, ahead of a mortgage crisis.

If I had more capital, I would throw money down on UHaul at the first sign of a dip, but at the present, this is what I have available. I can say the same about EXR. If I had the money, I'd diversify these calls, but I still consider this a worthwhile risk for an initial investment. I believe EXR has higher loss-tolerance because they have a higher market cap and more facilities, but fundamentally, they are identical to CUBE, with the caveat that CUBE has more facilities in high-density urban areas on average--at least according to the research I've been able to turn up.

Cubesmart still has solid fundamentals, they've beat earnings expectations every quarter last year, and had a 3% increase on dividends in December. With over a $7 Billion market cap, they have money to burn, and I think they'll come out huge at the end of this. Even with the pandemic hurting everyone, I am expecting a big push on Monday and the weeks to follow.

2. Cheap Goods and Wholesale $OSTK $COST $WMT $AMZN

My pick here is Overstock ($OSTK), but Cost-Co Walmart and Amazon are other obvious picks for people who can afford them. Sadly, a LOT of Americans are going to be very desperate as they face homelessness and have to bargain for essentials and cheap furniture. I don't like Walmart or Amazon because I disagree with their business practices as a whole, but you can't argue with their long-term performance and their success. That being said, they're safe bets even in a post-pandemic market disaster.

Fundamentally, I find  Overstock is WAY undervalued at $67 per share, especially at their recent high of $102 that got rejected in August 2020. They have been absolutely crushing expectations, and the only reason I believe they are so undervalued is because of the stiff competition and attention  whoring of Amazon and walmart. At < $70, $OSTK is at a huge discount.  I plan on buying shares with them, since options are unpredictable. Currently waiting on funds to settle, but I have limit positions set at 100 shares $80 limit price.

Call options on this one are higher due to recent volatility, but OTM calls a  few months out are still cheap. Assuming the price doesn't skyrocket (like I think it will in a couple months), and OSTK settles in at \~$80  per share, I plan on buying more share and calls as soon as the market  collapses, assuming I'm right about the housing market.

3. Travel industry $CAR $LUV $UAL

In the wake of the pandemic, travel industry froze overnight, which caused an immediate downturn. Nevertheless, the big names have been able to survive all this time, and some are doing better than ever now that restrictions have lifted and the market has shown its confidence by buying back into $CAR (Avis budget group) and $LUV (Southwest Airlines) hugely. I believe that $UAL (United Airlines) is lagging behind the trend at the moment because the market is awaiting reactions to a recent engine explosion that happened on a Boeing 777 flight. I am anticipating that the news is going to show that Boeing is the cause for blame, but if you are unsure, you could always do a straddle/strangle strategy on UAL. The price is likely to move sharply in one direction or the other, so it's a 50-50 shot. Fundamentally, UAL isn't going anywhere, since they service tons of international and domestic flights in the US.

The travel industry is exploding more because of people just itching to get free and travel again and not necessarily because of a housing market fiasco; however, it's worth pointing out that $CAR also owns Budget Truck, which is in the same vein as UHAL, which I've already discussed that I'm long on.

Fundamentally ABG is a strong company that is highly diversified across rental cars, trucks, vans, and even have rental-purchase agreements with used car dealerships which are likely to be a huge revenue stream once their older vehicles cycle out of their service lifetime. $CAR had to cut almost half its workforce because of the pandemic in order to preserve capital. They survived, and the market responded by exploding their price to $55.55, just barely under 20% of their previous ATH of $68.89. I expect them to continue to beat their previous performance, mainly because most of $CAR's competition got decimated by the pandemic and many of them still have not recovered. It's difficult to say if they will continue to move up as sharply as they have recently, but $60 OTM calls for 3/19 are absolutely within reason, in my opinion. These calls are currently very cheap at $2.15/contract, but if you're risk-averse, setting up a position to expire farther out, or simply buying a bunch of their stock while it's still reasonably priced are both good long-term strategies for me.

Again, I'm a  poor bitch, so I'm limited on capital and don't currently have a position in $CAR or $LUV, bu",,,,,,,,,,,,,True
For the record and full disclosure, I am also holding 500 shares of AMC (TO  THE MOON!!!), which I believe will reflect the sentiment of the public ahead of travel restrictions lifting completely. If people are willing to throw money at movie theaters, people are going to start traveling soon after that, and the outlook is promising for that.,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999882102,True
3/2/21 10:22,"RKT - compelling options chain, $1b buyback, great earnings, lots of short interest, and more. Disclaimer: I actually know nothing about this company, what they do, or who they are. Not financial advice.  Position: 50 x $26 3/19

This stock caught my eye a few days ago. It's got a lot going for it, and I think it's going to go critical soon. Or, maybe not. But I'm riding this fucking rocket and here's why you might want to as well:

* **They apparently crushed earnings.** I don't give a shit about earnings or fundamentals. If you care about this, search around and find out.
* **The options chain screams ""gamma ramp""**, and time is actually on its side. The amount of shares MMs need to buy to maintain their delta hedge is very sizeable (more than AMC and GME, per 1% price movements).  And, critically, *charm* is positive -- meaning that delta is increasing through time. That's right. At this price, wait a day, and MMs will buy more shares to delta hedge.
* **They are buying back $1b of stock**.  That means less float. That means a lot of buying demand. supply and demand -- more demand means price go up.
* **Float is 100m, short interest is 40m, price is ramping up.** A lot of this SI isn't shitty high-entry-point short interest .. it's that's ""this stock is going sideways, let's short it"" good good. Meaning *a lot* of this SI was established at lower-than-current price points. Many shorts are underwater now.
* **This stock was, up until a couple of days ago, relatively low volatility.** I think on Friday ATM options were something like 60-80%. Now they're around 120%. That's right, it's only just now getting all meme'd up.  Increasing volatility increases the deltas on OTM calls.. meaning, yep, more delta hedging pushing the price up. If this hits meme level and IV's go to 200%+, that'll require a shit ton of shares to be purchased as a hedge.
* They announced a $1.11 dividend or some shit, which is given to whomever owns stock at close this Friday. People are claiming that will ""force shorts to cover"" or whatever. It won't. I'm ignoring the dividend because where I'm from $1.11 can't even buy a 4-piece.

**Add up all the above, and that's a ton of buying pressure for this stock**

I'll now break down each point.

# Earnings

Like I said, I have no idea what these fuckers do, who they are, or what they earn. I'm assuming they earn dollars but it could be Taco Bell gift cards for all I care.

# The Options Chain

Here is a big table of numbers. Before your brain explodes, I'll explain each column:

* **Price**:  Imagine the stock price were this value.  Ok. Now read the next bullet points.
* **# Shares DeltaHedged**: When you write an option, you want to own shares just in case it expires ITM. How many shares should you own?  Delta. It's also the probability the option expires ITM.  So you write a $30 call, and delta is .15, then you should have 15 shares.  This cell will show you how many shares are required to delta hedge *all* the open contracts.
* **# Shares DeltaHedged % float**: The above value, divided by total shares floated. The higher this is, the more shares are ""locked up"" in MMs hands.
* **1% Price Movement Delta Shares**:  Still think gamma squeezes are cool?  This is the column you care about. At this price point if the price moved up 1%, this is how much delta would increase... and thus how many shares MMs will need to buy to keep their hedge.
* **% Float**: The above, relative to float. The higher this is, the more delta-hedging should, in theory, effect the price of the stock. Think of this as ""how hard is the gamma squeeze at this price point"".  For reference, GME has these values at about 0.40%, AMC at 0.60%, and PLTR at 0.25%.
* **$ stuff**: The previous two columns, in $ form. Just for kicks.
* **24hr Charm**: Ok this is important. There are gamma squeezes. And there are also charm squeezes. As options go closer to expiry, their delta will rapidly approach either 0 (if they are OTM), or 1 (if they are ITM).  None of this fractional bullshit -- just 0 or 1. At a price point if the majority of options are ITM, it means delta will zoom towards 1 and MMs need to buy shares. If the majority of options are OTM FDs that you retards love, then MMs sit there and wait for delta to zoom to 0, and they safely dump shares they had hedged just in case your retarded FD hit the jackpot.  RKT has positive charm.  I don't even want to show you GME or AMC... but it ain't pretty.

Each time the price goes up a dollar, look how many shares need to be bought, and look at it relative to float. This is good.  Also look at how many shares need to be purchased 24hrs from now. Positive numbers are good.

Now, I fuckin' love GME. That shit made me rich and I hold a lot of stock in it. I'm not saying it's going to drop, I'm just providing this chart as comparison.

GME also has a very good gamma ramp (~0.40% all the way up) and pretty huge inflows when price moves just 1%. But not as good as RKT.  Gamma ramps aren't necessary ""good"" or ""bad"" -- they just make it easier for the price to move because every buy/sell is in theory also copied in spades by MMs delta hedging. GME has gamma ramp in spades, because it also has a reeeaallly low *actual float* because all of us apes are holding onto shares.

Also, notice that fat negative charm. This is all of the OTM shit that is expiring soon. If the writers of these contracts delta hedged against them, all things equal they will start selling off the shares since the likelihood of them printing will approach zero.  RKT doesn't have that.  (Note: I'm long GME shares, but won't touch options bc vol is too high).

[Here are tables for GME, AMC, RKT, and CLVS](https://old.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/lv6nqc/meme_stock_update_monday_march_1_premarket/gpbcyip/) as well as a much more in depth discussion.


# Stock Buyback

I don't know much about this, but apparently they are going to buy back $1b in shares. When? I don't know. Soon hopefully? Either way, buying makes price go up and makes float go down.  When float goes down, each buy (either by you, MMs, or whoever else) should have more impact on the price.

# Short Interest

I feel like an asshole talking about short interest, because pretty much every time I read about it in a DD the person misses the point.  Short interest is only half the story -- the other half is *the price point that short interest was opened at* as well as *the underlying assumptions of the stock*.

**Price point of short interest**

Imagine you short sell a shit ton of stock at $100.  Now it goes to $20.  Then it goes to $30. And you hear people screaming: ""there is so much short interest! shorts are in trouble!!!"".  Would you, with your massive cock, be afraid when you're already up $70/share?  Do you feel compelled to cover anytime soon, or will you just watch idiots pile on and eventually paper hand? Probably worth shorting more at the little peak there, too.

Most of the time, it's pretty hard to tell when short interest was added. However, **not this time**.  We can see that short interest was added while the stock was trading sideways since Sept 2020.

What was short interest then, in Sep 2020?  **16.83m**.

What is short interest now? **45m**

**That means 30m shares were shorted at a price point between $20 - $24.  They are underwater, for sure.**

What are they going to do? As discussed, the gamma ramps are so fucking juicy that as they cover (buying shares) their buys will be mirrored by MMs causing the price to go up even further. At this point they are walking on fucking eggshells and I love it.

Now, this isn't a MOASS or even a ""big"" short squeeze... but it's 30m shares on a stock that sees a daily average of 
11m/day, and 30m/day on a huge day like today.  So I think the squeeze is good for at least $5-10 in price action.  Total ballpark guess pulled out of my ass, do not quote me on it... but that's how I'm playing it.

# Mispriced Volatility

This one is going to require more wrinkles. Up until a few days ago, this stock had a low IV, justifiably so. It was trading sideways for months, and nobody gave a shit about it. 

What's that mean? It means whoever was shorting it probably did not plan on it ever spiking like it is currently. That means they probably had less hedges in place, and may now start to realize they are overleveraged.  Did the shorts entering since Sept have any idea that the market would change to the fucked up retail casino that it is now, where a pack of wild apes can just pile on to a stock just because some dude writes a shitty DD on some subreddit full of retards, causing it to 2x in a matter of days for no real reason other than gambling on OTM options is fun and the ticker is RKT?  Probably not.

**The shorts may have perceived this as a low-volatility stock and positioned themselves as such.**

Low volatility also means that options were ""cheap"" -- so there are a fuck ton of them open right now.

Now the crucial point. As volatility increases, the deltas on OTM options increase. That's right, an *increase in volatility can cause a gamma squeeze*.

When I bought options on Friday the IV was like 60-80% or something. I really wish I had loaded up more... I would have if I had made my options chain chart by then.  Anyway, now, IVs for the same options are 125%.  I'm sure they'll pop even more tomorrow.

What's that mean? It means if you wrote options that had a delta of .1 on Friday, and they now have a delta of, say .2 tomorrow, it's time to buy 10 more shares per contract. Except, wait, you wrote something like 100,000 of those options...

# Dividend

I've seen some posts hyping up the dividend. ""Shorts will have to cover!!"" and ""free money!!"".  Ok, listen up. Dividends don't do jack shit here. They aren't good, and they aren't bad.

First of all, 40m shares x $1.11 is like $44m.  Imagine you have a position worth about a billion dollars, and somebody says to you: ""You can either cover at a huge loss, or you have to pay $44m"" -- which are you going to pick?  $44m is fucking nothing compared to the value of the position.

Second of all, it's not free fucking money. Stock prices go down when they issue dividends. Look at any stock with a dividend on the date it's issued. It goes down because the company's cash balance goes down by the distribution amount.

Am I worried about the price dropping for RKT?  Fuck no. $1.11 is nothing compared to the recent price action, and the sheer amount of shares that need to be delta hedged on a continuous basis, especially more so if the price goes up.

# Other shit

I recommend searching the ticker on wsb for more info about the actual company and why others are bullish. Like I said, I don't give a fuck what these guys do.  Just ignore anybody talking about how the dividend forces shorts to cover. They are retarded like me, but more.

[Click here you lazy retard.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=rkt&restrict_sr=on&t=week)

# What to do

Not financial advice. But look for the lowest IV options anywhere from $20 - $30, expiring next week or a month or two. Play it safe.  Keep a pulse on it and sell as it spikes and as IV becomes ludicrous.  Save some for YOLO.

I have no price target. I just know this thing has to pop sooner or later and probably go back down to it's comfort zone plus a little no-longer-supressed-by-short-interest premium. So, maybe it'll get to $28 comfortably?

Guessing prices is not my forte. I enter into positions and exit them slowly when shit goes my way... occasionally letting house money ride into the valhalla or the graveyard.

Also, keep a close eye on the Ortex Short Interest numbers. As shorts start to cover, it might be time to exit. Or you can let it ride and hope that the gamma ramps keep propping up the price. Just know at some point it will have to revert to some new average price.

# Conclusion

So that's my DD. What I like:

* an options chain formed when volatility was low, with a shit ton of delta hedging going to be required if IV goes up, and if/when it moves up dollar by dollar
* short interest that was established at a known price that is underwater
* a ticker named RKT, for fucks sake

Lastly, I'm sorry I did not write this sooner. I dipped my toes in on Friday off of other DD that was good (except for the dividend ""shorts must cover"" bullshit).  Then I did my whole options chain table producing thingy and noticed how superior the gamma ramp and charm was for this ticker vs [some other beloved meme stocks](https://old.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/lv6nqc/meme_stock_update_monday_march_1_premarket/gpbcyip/).

Hope you‚Äôre all feeling good, it was a bullish as hell day for the entire market, and to my fucking relief it wasn‚Äôt ridiculously volatile. I can‚Äôt handle that volatility, my little heart is beating hard enough trying to get my fat ass out of my parent‚Äôs basement at least once a day so I can get some fucking food.

So, I wanna say, I‚Äôm long on GameStop and AMC- in fact, my net worth is almost entirely from those two stocks. I started with $3k in December and am now sitting on a cool $130k, and I‚Äôm feeling fucking good about it. However, I want to take a moment to do a little bit of teaching.

You know how when you‚Äôre YOLOing your entire net worth on GME and AMC calls expiring this week, you have to put money down, and it‚Äôs a fucking shit ton of money if you were to buy a call outside of this week? Who does that money go to? That‚Äôs right, üåà üêª. Now, what if I were to tell you that you could be just as bullish, set up the ability to AUTOMATICALLY AVERAGE DOWN if the stock crashes, and get paid for the right to do it?

It exists, and it‚Äôs fucking simple: The cash-covered put. Now, you‚Äôre already bullish on AMC, right? Okay. You have your 1000 shares, you‚Äôre feeling good, but you still have 10k sitting outside of the market. You don‚Äôt care about any other stocks, what, you are supposed to look at more numbers next to more than two sets of three letters? Fuck off.

Here‚Äôs how this would work. Look at AMC right now. It‚Äôs above $9 per share, and it‚Äôs not going to fucking go back down. That would be stupid. Stocks. Only. Go. Up.

Here‚Äôs what you can do: Tomorrow morning around 9:30AM EST, you look at the fucking stock and you open up the option chain and you pick the $9 Strike Put Expiring this Friday and you hit the sell button and you sell ten puts expiring this Friday, that‚Äôs 1000 shares worth. And what happens, do you ask?

Well, you get paid a premium of $1000 to sell that put. That‚Äôs right, the bears are paying you now for the right to lose money by being bearish on fucking AMC. You put $8000 on the line, and you can‚Äôt touch that until you either buy to close the put you sold or it expires OTM.

But, Ragnaroktagon, what is my risk? What happens if it goes down? That‚Äôs the beauty of it: If the stock closes below $9 on Friday, then you get the stock. 1000 more shares. And because of the premium you were paid by those idiot bears, you are in the green on that stock so long as the stock stays above $7.97.

And if it stays above $9 per share on Friday? You get your initial investment back plus a clean $1000. You can‚Äôt fucking lose. Either you get more of the stock, or free money. And, since you already own those 2k shares, you benefit from the stock going up with those as well, and on Monday morning you have liquidity again with the ability to either do it again or buy some more fucking calls, you filthy animals.

AMC could really take off

This may sound crazy but have been discussing this after someone in a group chat stumbled upon it. The OI for 3/19 40C for AMC is insane. 

Now we know that after AMC finished above $8 on Friday that a gamma squeeze should‚Äôve happened. It has not yet. The volume has been too low. Under SEC regulations, those shares need to be delivered by 9:30 AM EST four days after the expiration date of the contract was exercised, that is tomorrow. 

There‚Äôs also been an insane number of ITM calls. Tons over the next few weeks. Stock markets with Bruce discussed a possible theory about GME that might fit here. I‚Äôll post the link at the bottom. Basically, hedge funds might be buying an insane number of ITM calls to cover for there short losses during the last run. That could certainly explain the high volume we‚Äôve seen. 

So what about those 40Cs? I think these hedge funds think the stock is gonna moon in the next few weeks. Those calls are dirt cheap and if they think it‚Äôs going well above 40, there is a lot of money to be made. There‚Äôs something like 24k 40C that expire this week and another 25k that expire 3/19. Maybe the hedge funds spent the week driving the price down and buying a bunch of cheap calls, knowing that the gamma squeeze would happen Thursday, ensuring profits. 

Again, this is just a theory. I‚Äôm not a financial adviser and am not giving financial advice. I‚Äôm just providing an explanation for why AMC hasn‚Äôt taken off yet.

Billions of dollars gets dumped into SEARS a year by the children - young adult demographic. SEARS gift cards are always sold out at Target, Wal-Mart, and Best Buy where I live. Current reports are saying it will be a slow climber because of COVID restrictions loosening in a few months(or now if you're in TX) because the target demographic will stop sheltering in place, which means they won't be playing video games as much and I think it is hilarious.

Do the people who do these analyses know that gamers don't see sunlight? Do they know that I, a 40 year old man, spent my teen summers in the basement playing my N64? Why do they think suddenly kids will stop playing the gaming platform they've been addicted to for a year? Fat chance. Yes, SEARS won't be adding as many users as they did in 2020, but that doesn't mean the cash machine they've created won't keep printing money. Personally, I love the platform and have been designing my own SEARS game for months now.  I will be buying as many shares as I can afford(might even dump my AMC shares for a small loss to move those funds into SEARS).  My questions is, who else is planning to jump on the SEARS rocket? What are your thoughts about it?

Lastly, this is not financial advice. I am not some amazing financial wizard, but a dumb ape that eats crayons and tendies slathered in golden honey mustard. Invest at your own risk and never invest what you can't afford to lose. I'm only speculating on stonks that I like and I really like the SEARS stonk.

3/3/21 22:58,"I love this community... but we need to talk. I've been a longtime lurker in this sub, even before I grew a pair and started dipping my toes into the market.  The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  

I only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn't too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  

I don't listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don't blindly trust DD.  

Why I feel I need to post today:  
The mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don't know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.

I've seen some DD that suggests it's a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that's the case, I don't think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don't just lose your diamond hands on a whim.

I've seen other DD that suggests it's a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I'm  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). 

What conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.  And unfortunately, I think it's starting to work.  Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.  

I love this community.  I hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference.  When it comes to money, it's easy to manipulate peoples feelings.  I just hope that in the end, Apes Together Strong is the sentiment.

Coast is clear for now, you better eat as much chickens and eggs as possible. Cuz the dogs and bears are coming for our gains and chickens. $AMC is safe to go to the moon for a few days but will taper off next week. Saddle the fuck up, stay the fuck away from $GME unless you have balls of steel and trying to catch an aneurysm. But if you time it well, you might drive a new car. But I can't assure you. I will say, today's pop of $GME was a change of CFO in the company, showing they are serious about their management. So, it might be a legit company but the sugar rush can get you killed.
I'm not too greedy, so Imma stick with the smaller chicken, $AMC does have a solid balance sheet and very low debt. Soon to be acquired. I think there may be three pops.


1. Riding the $GME meme stock wave, but tapers cuz Wallstreet gonna bitch a little and Robinhood might do their fuckery. 

2. The second pop gonna piggyback on the news for opening 13 theaters in the east coast in March. I think it might taper off due to mix reactions of the theaters opening.

3. The third one I think it's gonna be related to being acquired cuz I think the players will see the potential in $AMC to integrate it into their existing streaming service.

 If I were in the mind of any company let's say Amazon or Netflix who are currently in talks on acquiring the mega cinema movie chain.
 
This would be the perfect opportunity to recoup lost revenue from 2020 COVID pandemic shutdown,bit will bolster their revenue by expanding the existing A-Lister program from $AMC to either companies existing streaming service subscriptions. And I would provide discount deals to like 20% off to combine the streaming service and enjoying the new ticket movie reservation experience at the theaters.

Somewhat similar to what HBO max is doing, but there's a possibility that the streaming service titans will now have a new jar that they can stick they hands in, the movies theater and distribution industry. Because if they own the movies, they now can receive their cut from movie distribution like Disney who hold their properties close to the chest to play their movies on the newly owned theaters. Some movies that either streaming service owns rights to, they'll have the more affordable plans without the theater plan if that customer isn't comfortable to go to the theaters or even prefer the comfort of their home. How ever it goes, it's going to be a solid win for either Amazon or Netflix.

That's just an opinion and an idea of mine. I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own research. I'm just a Fox who loves fucking shit up in the Swamp and help other to eat some too if they're silly as I am.

3/3/21 10:49,"AMC Prediction: March 5-March 11 Huge Gains # Let's start a little about AMC [Last Year Especially]

AMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives.

Now over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \[steadily\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.

Early last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low.

So to sum up why it was low last year.

&#x200B;

* Streaming services being used more
* Cinemas closed due to Covid.
* No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]
* Bankruptcy possibility
* Free reign hedge fund short selling
* No one buying the stock

# Now this year is different

We all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.

# Overvalued or Undervalued?

For the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.

&#x200B;

* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for personal use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.
* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.
* ~~No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson & Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.
* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.
* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \[if not most\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.
* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back now by hedge funds.

Now I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.

# Now Lets Talk About March

&#x200B;

* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.

[Notice March is at a peak or leads to peak in every year except Covid year 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)

&#x200B;

* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares

[Wanda Group converts stock in order to sell, preparing for a rise in price to sell off?](https://preview.redd.it/0fuvle80gpk61.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1e6f32c67b9ef97febcb47764085f8744c6d33)

&#x200B;

# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.

A lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different.

&#x200B;

* March 5th \[this Friday\] theaters will reopen in NY \[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.

[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)

&#x200B;

* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \[my belief it is\] this will drive the price up farther.

https://preview.redd.it/ecj12fvpjpk61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e7d0fd12cedcab1659dbd3dc1ca69210adad2d

* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)

Not only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)

*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating that Amazon or Netflix may buy AMC and this day could be the announcement date. It is entirely possible AMC would come up with some good news even if this were not the case for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*

&#x200B;

* Texas will lift all Covid restrictions March 10th, farther reason for price to possibly go up.

&#x200B;

* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \[March 5th\] to Short interest report \[March 9th\] and Earning report \[March 10th after hours into 11th\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.

3/3/21 09:02,"The Truth about RKT... This is not financial advice and neither do you have to listen to my opinion. I‚Äôm just expressing myself...

With that being said, I honestly don‚Äôt think that RKT is a shill tactic. RKT is probably a short squeeze separate to the GME and AMC squeezes. Is it distracting? it sure as hell is. Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it‚Äôs worth investing in, maybe not.

I personally do not have a position in RKT and I won‚Äôt go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I‚Äôm still -45% (it was -82% but I continued to average down) but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. 

Now back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn‚Äôt sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would‚Äôve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. 

At the end, it‚Äôs your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can‚Äôt fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you‚Äôll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There‚Äôs no telling when it will end. But when it does it‚Äôll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.

Of course you do not have to listen to me. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes. HODL (and GL to all you RKT squeezers I guess, I hope you put some of that profit  into GME or put your losses back into GME and be ready for what I call the ‚ÄúRocket Gamma Short Squeeze‚Äù üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: I do feel very conflicted with this post I made, and I might take it down. Is it a way to directly distract us (I.e, their manipulating RKT stock upwards)?  No. but are they indirectly manipulating the stock (I.e, through all of the media coverage and bots sharing gains on WSB and stuff)? I very much think this can be the case. If you ever see an increase in posts where people are praising RKT and shaming GME then that‚Äôs blatant manipulation... 
But I just cannot stand seeing my fellow apes acting like GME cultists, we mustn‚Äôt get too emotional and think everything has got to do with GME. I own some TILRAY stocks long term, and I also hold CCIV stocks long term and continue to dollar cost average down into profits. But when it comes to short term, I‚Äôm solely focused on GME and AMC and I own far more GME than any other stock currently because I really believe in this movement, plus my brain would malfunction if I has to look at more than two shares at onceüòÖ",37634,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.978229463,True

3/4/21 13:59,"$OCGN - Why this Ticker Deserves $20 By Friday Hello Fellas, 

I‚Äôm sure most of you have had your focus on taxes, GME, RKT, AMC or whatever else which is highly respectable works. I‚Äôve been a lurker here since around Fall of 2020 If i‚Äôm correct and have finally decided to spread a good cause.

Today, I come to write up a storm about how Ocugen is still undervalued, not in wants of a meme moment but in want of true investors who are willing to learn more about this very promising company and reap staggering rewards.

Earlier this morning Ocugen‚Äôs partner for a COVID-19 Vaccine, Bharat Biotech released their ‚ÄúInterim Phase III Data‚Äù in other words the effectiveness to their vaccine. Coming in at %81 it surpassed Johnson & Johnson measly %66. Although markets have been awfully red me and the other $OCGN believers saw a massive premarket volume topping off at 10AM (45% Gain) But me and many others alike are not simply looking to day trade this stock or swing it...

Ocugen's Covaxin focuses on preventing COVID-19, not reducing hospitalizations. This is far superior to 
$NVAX, $JNJ and others. It also works just as effectively against the mutant variants. Pretty Powerful.

The news of Phase III Data was not suppose to drop for a week or so, but it came as a surprise today. Unluckily the shorts did bleed the ever living fuck out of Ocugen today while market sentiment was lower.

Personally I missed out on the gains from February but I am sticking to this stock because it is the only one that I truly believe in. Very enticing PR is right around the corner. OCGN/Bharat Biotech intend on getting EUA + FDA Approval this same month.

The fact that OCGN still finished green today when almost everything else in their sector was red as well as every index, says something. 

You could argue that the top of Ocugen has already been met at $18 a few weeks back... Though let us not forget that the ticker only saw a $2 Gain on its news of a vaccine partnership, and two days later rocketed to $18. I surely believe something very similar can most definitely happen this week.

India, France, and Brazil are onboard as well. Ocugen is based in Pennsylvania for any wondering and has had people on the case to push this out ASAP.

3/4/21 10:24,"One apes thoughts on everything going down I am curious to know if I am in the minority or majority on some thoughts I have on the ongoing saga of GME vs. everything else. I will TL;DR at the bottom in the order that I present my following points. In case I miss saying it anywhere, the following post is **my opinion.**

First full disclosure I have a position in GME and BB (and other non-WSB stocks). With that out of the way lets get started:

1. I am holding GME for the tendies...BUT it has an added bonus **in my opinion** the potential of exposing very questionable trading practices by some parties on the other side. The longer this goes on, the more desperate other parties will get, bigger chance for a slip up (such as the RH buying halt). I also hold for the sweet loss porn of hedge funds affected.
2. Other stocks that have DD but I do not hold. Yes, I have been down voting them (with the exception of AMC though). No, not because I immediately assume they are shills but rather I personally don't understand the logic of presenting a new stock to YOLO when the DD for GME is so insanely well documented and vetted.

* More on point 2, I understand apes will not necessarily want to YOLO everything on 1 stock and may want to diversify. Again this is only **my opinion,** if that is the case though I would think it more sensible to pick a YOLO/Meme stock of your own choosing and then throw down in some more ""normal"" stocks. But hey for those that went into multiple YOLO/Meme stocks, all the power to ya. This is WallStreet**BETS**, not WallStreet**SENSIBLE**.

3. Here are facts, WSB currently has 9.4 million degenerates. The spike in accounts was occurring over the period of time WSB was making media headlines. Media outlets were showing selected WSB posts on mainstream media therefore there are members of the media on WSB (perhaps not with accounts but proven to be digging thru the sub.

* Now for **my opinion**. I believe it is very likely that many of the new WSBers are here to stir shit up. Some of them are detracting from GME and I believe that there are some that are supporting GME. Yes, I think there are big players here who are competitors to the hedge funds that are currently trapped shorting GME. To me this seems like a logical move, especially for a hedge fund that sees an opportunity to gobble up another businesses' clients.

TL;DR **my opinion**

1. Why I hold. GME = Tendies + potential extra bonuses (RH oopsie)
2. I down vote non-GME DD. Not because bad DD, but because GME DD > ""insert ticker"" DD
3. WSB = Big community = media attention = bad actors = bad actors **FOR** and **AGAINST** GME
4. There is no #4, this was a test

3/4/21 08:41,"$SKT to $200? Might be rarted, might be genius- I'm doing it either way. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ Like a lot of my fellow smooth-brained ü¶ç, I view $SKT as not just the next short squeeze, but primed for a gamma squeeze that *will look insane* and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricks-and-mortar retail industry. There are a lot of heavily shorted names out there, and while I expect most of them to reap massive tendies, $SKT is the one that stands out.

Let's start with the elephant in the room: **short-interest** and **% float**. $SKT is currently the most shorted stock out there, with 31.76% of total shares short as of this morning. This beats any of the names we know, GME, AMC, BB, RKT, etc. Interestingly enough, $SKT's \*% short float is at 47.25%!!\*Compared to every other ""meme stock,"" (other than GME with 60% +), $SKT is easily one of the most, ***if not THE most*** shorted names in the market right now. ([https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)).

Not to mention, *the shares float* provides incredible insights into $SKT's future tendies. Similarly to GME, SKT only has about 90M shares outstanding, while GME has roughly 69M (lol). BBBY has about 121M shares outstanding, which explains why it got somewhat closer to GME than others. But these other names- RKT (1.98B shares), AMC (339M shares), NOK (5.7B shares), BB (563M shares), all have simply *too many shares outstanding*. That's not to say it's impossible to squeeze 'em, but it would require far less capital to squeeze GME, BBBY, or say, **$SKT**.

The trend in short-interest also seems to be going down, with $SKT and the broader market in general. The WSJ wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts (or at least being more cautious), and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in Q4, SKT short interest is off another 19% since February.

Over the past 6 months, we have also seen ever-increasing volume on $SKT. A previous DD mentioned average trading volume on $SKT from the Dec-Feb period was roughly 3M shares, this has increased to roughly $5M shares in the last few months. Today, $SKT appeared to breach the seal with over 17.5M, topping the 10M high we saw in Jan (coincided w/ GME). *This is incredibly important b/c heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts*. *Essentially, if I am right, Chapter 1 began today.* (we should keep an eye on the volume this week, more volume is a *great* sign).

All of the technical trends bode well for $SKT. But what's got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy. First, $SKT reinstated their dividend for 2021 Q1, indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm, but to continue raising payouts to shareholders, which is quite attractive since üåàüêª are getting concerned about rising rates. No problem- SKT has stable, fixed payments, and will award investors for holding- *these will also increase as the economy improves, attracting more investors*. **‚úÖ**

Next, we heard from Biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by May, not July. This is a *huge WIN* for battered-down bricks-and-mortar retailers who have caved b/c of public health restrictions. As investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots, the ""value"" or really just oversold names will start to fly. **‚úÖ**

Not to mention, Tanger Mall Outlets' whole premise is their malls are ***OUTDOORS***, perfect for a post-Covid world that is more mindful of social distancing/sanitation. **‚úÖ**

Where do I think this could go? This is where market cap/valuation comes into play. For all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask ""wHy It DoNt Go Up,"" *market cap is the true determinant*. $SKT currently has a $1.7B market cap, far less than competitors MAC ($2.1B), SPG ($40B) or other highly shorted names like RKT ($56B) or AMC ($2.9B).

So is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic? Sure. But tldr, when you factor in **how shorted $SKT has been** (heavily shorted by Melvin Capital among others; most shorted stock right now- overall/float), the **attractive fundamentals** (outdoors/social distancing friendly), the **improving economic landscape** (vaccine ramp-up by May/$2T stimulus that will really help small companies), **rising rates** (the shift towards value/dividend-paying stocks)- I have to say, I like the stock, quite a lot.

So help me God, $SKT is going to fucking *skrt-skrt* to the moon!

\*UPDATE: A lot of people have been saying Melvin Capital owns SKT. This is **FALSE**. Melvin owns SKT convertible debt- likely b/c they are grubbing for yield (who can blame them on something as fruitful as SKT)? This actually is a good sign to me, as boomers who find SKT dividends attractive will push up the stock- another catalyst for a gamma squeeze. *Never ever fall victim to false information, please do your own homework*.

To the moon we go üöÄüöÄüöÄ

PREVIOUS DD:

$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read üòå

9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let‚Äôs look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME‚Äôs short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! üëÄ Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger‚Äôs new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let‚Äôs hope he get‚Äôs it right with $SKT. üôèüèæ

After a long hiatus (banned for mentioning a SPAC that went from 10 to 60 back to 24, and AMC before it was 1 billion in value). I have returned for the next big opportunity. Honestly there are a few with the recent route in the market, but here is opportunity #1 in my opinion based on technical and internal financial information.

Alibaba ticker BABA: But OP, china risk, and regulation, and it‚Äôs down 26.25% from its high of $317.14! STFU and keep reading:

[Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (BABA : NYSE) Stock Price & News - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BABA:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijpci4gZfvAhUaGVkFHT4EDsoQ3ecFMAB6BAgGEBo)

Yup that‚Äôs why I love the company. Alibaba posted better than expected earnings beating on top and bottom with growth YOY 36% yeah that‚Äôs amazing. Because fundamentally nothing has changed. It‚Äôs current P/e is an amazingly low 25.93x yes, a company growing 30% YOY is trading below its growth rate and further the sector average P/e is 49.18x Now I know we are fucking retarded here so based on basic math BABA is valued at half of its competitors. That‚Äôs a buy signal alone as if it can reach the same valuation; get ready: it doubles from this price.

But OP China is going to regulate big Chinese tech! No, China wants to be the leader in tech and can‚Äôt afford to cut the legs from its largest most profitable companies. The recent ‚ÄúNEWS‚Äù on the clamping down of its tech companies is in my opinion noise. Think of it this way: When FB was fined in the EU they fined FB $122 Million dollars. Ouch. (But not really because: day do be rich doh! FB is in a similar BABA spot in the USA I like it too) China‚Äôs fine to Alibaba? 76k [China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals) Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a serious reprimand‚Ä¶ This is classic China manipulation of their publicly traded companies to reduce the price before they rocket higher. They do this very often in the penny stock area of the market. This time they just went bigger. ANT ipo? Still on, they just are requiring higher cash reserves for the lending arm. What does that mean? It means that the loans provided by ANT will have better backing and will be less likely for default. Further ANT deals with digital money and the people‚Äôs republic of china government has already said they are looking to Alibaba to help roll out with a digital yuan. See what‚Äôs going on here?

3/7/21 20:26,"When stocks go down it's time for stonks to go up: short squeeze explained Key takeaways: 

* A short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short-sellers bail out to cut their losses.
* Contrarian (= apes together strong) investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.
* Both short-sellers and contrarians (r/wallstreetbets) are making risky moves. A wise  investor has additional reasons for shorting or buying that stock...

Beginning in January 2021, a series of short squeezes occurred on several different stocks, including GameStop Corp. (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC),  following concerted efforts by retail traders on Reddit (=apes ) to drive up the  price of the stocks. This resulted in large price spikes as short  sellers were forced to cover their short positions for substantial  losses. These volatile price movements were not driven by fundamental  factors or news about the companies. Investors should be particularly  cautious when considering trading stocks during short squeezes. 

 *What Is a Short Squeeze?*  

A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher,  forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in  order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds  to the upward pressure on the stock's price.  

Short-sellers borrow shares of an asset that they believe will drop in  price in order to buy them after they fall. If they're right, they  return the shares and pocket the difference between the price when they  initiated the short and the actual sale price. If they're wrong, they're  forced to buy at a higher price and pay the difference between the  price they set and its sale price.   

Short sales have an expiration date, so when a stock unexpectedly rises  in price, the short-sellers may have to act fast to limit their losses. 

 *Understanding the Short Squeeze*  

The flight of short-sellers and their impact on the stock's price is  known as a short squeeze. Short sellers are being squeezed out of their  positions, usually at a loss. 

Short sellers zero in on a stock that they think is overvalued by the  market. For example, Tesla captured the enthusiasm of many investors  with its innovative approach to producing and marketing electric  vehicles. Investors bet heavily on its potential. Short sellers bet  heavily on its failure. In early 2020, Tesla was the most-shorted stock  on the U.S. exchanges, with more than [18% of its outstanding stock](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/telsa-shorts-down-8-billion-in-2020-including-2point5-billion-on-monday.html) in short positions.      

In late 2019 through early 2020, Tesla stock soared by 400%. Short  sellers got hammered, collectively losing about $8 billion. In early  March 2020, Tesla's stock finally fell, along with most others, during a  market downturn. Ôªø Short sellers made about $50 billion in a sell-off that lasted a few days. 

*Why Short Squeezes Happen*  

As noted, short-sellers open positions on stocks that they believe will  decline in price. However sound their reasoning is, it can be upended by  a positive news story, a product announcement, or an earnings beat that  excites the interest of buyers. 

The turnaround in the stock‚Äôs fortunes may prove to be temporary. But if  it's not, the short seller can face runaway losses as the expiration  date on their positions approaches. They generally opt to sell out  immediately even if it means taking a substantial loss. 

 That's where the short squeeze comes in. Every buying transaction by a  short-seller sends the price higher, forcing another short-seller to  buy.  

 *How to Measure Short Interest*  

Two measures useful in identifying stocks at risk of a short squeeze are [short interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp) and the [short-interest ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterestratio.asp).  Short interest is the total number of shares sold short as a percentage  of total shares outstanding. Tesla's 18% short interest was extremely  high. The short-interest ratio is the total number of shares sold short  divided by the stock‚Äôs average daily trading volume. Speculative stocks  tend to have higher short interest than more stable companies. 

Watching short interest can tell you whether investor sentiment about a  company is changing. For example, if a stock typically has a 15% to 30%  short interest, a move above or below that range could signal investors  have shifted their view on the company. Fewer short shares could mean  the price has risen too high too quickly, or that the short sellers are  leaving the stock because it has become too stable. 

 A rise in short interest above the norm indicates investors have become  more bearish. But an extremely high reading could be a sign of a coming  short squeeze, which could force the price higher.  

 *Betting on a Short Squeeze*  

[Contrarian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contrarian.asp)  investors may buy stocks with heavy short interest in order to exploit  the potential for a short squeeze. A rapid rise in the stock price is  attractive, but it is not without risks. The stock may be heavily  shorted for good reason, such as it has a dismal future outlook. 

Active traders will monitor highly shorted stocks and watch for them to  start rising. If the price begins to pick up momentum the trader jumps  in to buy, trying to catch what could be a short squeeze and a  significant move higher. 

*Risks of Trading Short Squeezes*  

There are many examples of stocks that moved higher after they had a  heavy short interest. But there are also many stocks that are heavily  shorted and keep falling in price. 

A heavy short interest does not mean the price will rise. It means that  many people believe it will fall. Anyone who buys in the hopes of a  short squeeze should have other, and better, reasons to think that the  price of the stock will go higher. 

*Example of a Short Squeeze*  

Consider a hypothetical biotech company, Medicom, that has a drug candidate in advanced clinical trials. 

There is considerable skepticism among investors about whether this drug  will actually work. As a result, there is heavy short interest. In  fact, five million Medicom shares have been sold short of its 25 million  shares outstanding. That means the short interest on Medicom is 20%,  and with daily trading volume averaging one million shares, the  short-interest ratio is five. The short interest ratio, also called  days-to-cover, means that it will take five days for short sellers to  buy back all Medicom shares that have been sold short. 

Assume that because of the huge short interest, Medicom had declined  from $15 a few months ago to $5. Then, the news comes out that Medicom‚Äôs  drug works better than expected. Medicom‚Äôs shares jump to $9, as  speculators buy the stock and short-sellers scramble to cover their  short positions. 

Everyone who shorted the stock between $9 and $5 is now in a losing  position. Those who sold short near $5 are facing the biggest losses and  will be frantically looking to get out as they are losing 80% on their  investment. 

The stock opens at $9, but it will continue to rally for the next  several days as the shorts continue to cover their positions and new  buyers are attracted by the rising price and positive news.

Hello autists, apes and retards of all colors, ages and gender dispositions!

Several month lurker here who got turned onto WsB by deciding to nature watch, then simper on the sidelines, and finally try my hand at going full retard after realizing I had timed and watched a historic event unfold before my eyes...

Watching GME and AMC through this latest (squeeze?), I noticed this week that AMC and GME's correlation seems to have fallen off.  GME has now formed a double base(2nd forming)consolidation(generally thought of as a launching platform) and has generally been uptrending.  AMC, on the other hand, has fallen off and popped off the 7.5ish support level for the 3d time in the past 7 days.

What does this mean?  Possibly that AMC is a sideshow to GME, and the weaker of the two.  If this earnings season has shown anything, its the old adage of ""buy the rumor, sell the news"".  We know AMC is reopening, etc, etc; but it has faced serious stock dilution and is not behaving the right way.  GME has confirmed less than 10 mil available to short, and solid mechanical probability of squeezing higher. 

But what do I know?  I just went full retard.

u/akiro_no_boku has a lot of cash in his portfolio and he wants to buy AMC. But he does not want to buy it at $8 a share; that's too expensive for his smooth brain!  What he can do is ""sell to open"" a put at a strike of $7 by 3/12.

Lets say he has $7000 dollars. Well, that means he can ""sell to open"" 10 cash secured puts. He will get paid roughly $400 in premium for doing so. Well done, smooth brained guy! Go buy some cocaine...or don't. I don't care.

After I do this, can still use my $7k to gamble or buy cocaine? No. Your money will be held as collateral until the contracts are expired or exercised. Sorry!

But, Mac1222, what if the price of the stock hits, or goes below $7 at expiration? I'm glad you asked. If this occurs, you will be obligated to buy 1000 shares of AMC at $7. Congrats! you now own AMC..(diamond hand that MF). u/akiro_no_boku is happy because he wanted to buy AMC anyway.

What if AMC goes down to $5 before expiration. Well, you just lost a lot money. You will still be forced to buy AMC at $7 a share, even though the value is $5. But, hey, you made $400 in premium

What if AMC stays above $7 before the end of the week? Nothing! You options will expire worthless and you will keep the $400 in premium

What if I want out of my contracts before expiration? Easy. Remember that you have originally had 10 ""sell to open"" contracts. You  will show (-10) because you are short. You will need to ""buy to close"" the 10 options and pay the premium. Poof......the contracts are done.

You own at least 900 shares of AMC, well that means you can sell 9 covered calls to suckers on this sub. You might sell an option with a $10 strike price that will expire 3/12 and each option might be worth $50 in premium, I don‚Äôt know. So 9\*50=$450 dollars. Way to go. Go invest that money.

Please refer below:

$UWMC - I truly like this stock.

Quick degenerate outlook. Most recent quarterly earnings had a great earnings report. Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase/growth overall.

Short Interest - I see a lot of people talking about short interest and short float percentage and don't seem to quite understand it completely. If there's a short interest of %10 thats considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater thats considered extremely high. When GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. With that aside, here are some current updates on the short percentages of UWMC, GME, AMC, RKT.

UWMC - 28% as of 03/03/2021

Fair value of UWMC as per Simply Wall Street = $64.40 - Currently going for $10.00.

\*\* This has been pointed out by u/bbwasawesome that SWS has updated their fair value to $19.78. This makes sense as this stock is valued anywhere between $20-$60 in a normal market.\*\*

UWMC is Americas leader in underwriting loans and mortgages. They have differentiated themselves from their competitors by having their business create the fastest and most effective consumer to lender process to be qualified/approved for their mortgage application and be provided the best competitive rates.  UWMC doesn't ""Lend"" any funds, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they provide institutions, lenders, and consumers is a simple process they can use to apply, compare, and complete a mortgage application. Their system and software is proprietary to UWMC and institutions such as small banks, credit unions, brokers, and lenders use it because it reduces time & cost on a multitude of spectrums and the process is much quicker; meaning closing applications faster equates to higher revenue for institutions and Lenders. The whole process is completed through UWMC from consumer to lender, and provides enormous benefit to both B2C and B2B.

Lastest earnings showed they were up 35% last year, slaughtered the expected numbers. They control the majority of the ammo market in the middle of an ammo shortage, they acquired multiple failing ammo producers right in the middle of this as well. 

I think they are significantly undervalued and here's why; In this ammo shortage, when they're already earning quite well they announced that 04/01/21 the price of their ammo will increase 3-15%. They're currently scaling up production to meet demand to tackle the mountain of about 1 billion dollars in backlog. Did I mention that the ammo hoarders are THE least rational consumers on the planet? If a senator so much as suggests gun control or expanding background checks they go out and clean off store shelves. With the all blue admin we have now I think those folks are going to be as retarded as ever.

Today being the Red Wedding day for everything in the market, (except for the champs in GME), VSTO dropped to $28. Now this significant because ZERO bad news came out of the company, in fact sales appear to be up higher lately too.

3/7/21 19:08,"What is really behind the AMC meeting on May 4th ?! repost - Regarding May 4 meeting and agenda, i would like to turn on the light here...

**Apes, this is a long read, but very important info for you to be aware of May 4 meeting and 500.000.000 shares that everyone is stressed about:)**

You guys are missing a very important piece of the information here, in my opinion you‚Äôre absolutely losing it because you are so concerned of the ‚Äúdilution‚Äù that Won‚Äôt be in any ways with those 500.000 shares ( they will ask just the permission to increase the ceiling, but not the actual share issuance ) !!!I think what is about to happen on that meeting on May 4, is what we are fucking asking each other for the last weeks !!! Why the AMC management it doesn‚Äôt take actions yet !

And this is the moment when AMC vs HF war taking the next step, where the management wants to fuck the HF exactly how they did with AMC lately.

**So, here‚Äôs how the process usually works** : In order for a traded publicly company, to issue additional shares to their previous portfolio, the company has to do a total Audit of shareholders and to count each and every fucking share that was ever issued by AMC. This is a Non avoidable requirement, because it has to do with legal matter and official valuation of the business and SEC is the first to be notified and informed about !!!

**We are suspicious that on the market are floating 2-3 or even more times more shares that AMC officially has on public market. And the reason of this suspicious thought is the amount of shorted shares increases, while we see the shorting availability it‚Äôs under 1.000.000 shares for many weeks already. The question is evident, WTF is going on here ? Where‚Äôs fucking SEC looking at ???????**

**Our suspicion has a solid ground because more and more numbers are put together and its official already that AMC is one of the most ever helded stock, with a 99 % utilization rate, with under 1.000.000 shares available for shorting per day and being Shorted every day with at least 15.000.000 to 100.000.000 shares ( depending on the volume of trading)... Do you guys see any logic here ???im sure you don‚Äôt, nor I do and i think AMC management and CEO in particular, don‚Äôt see logic in this as well...**

I think, AMC CEO, being a very intelligent and smart individual, came up with an absolute legal and I would say the most legal tactic to Fuck all the shorts...

**Absolutely Yes !!!** During this process (shares auditing), all previously issued shares are accounted and aligned to an owner. During this process, will be counted all of the shares and appearance of **Synthetic Shares,** becomes not a problem but a Serious Conflict ! This can result in a brokerage and HFs license withdraw and guarantee jail for who was involved in the process.Think about this, you have a car in your garage, but one day 10 more people are coming to your garage and are showing you that they have 10 similar Titles of your car, but you never sold your car and you never had a loan on your car. No financial institutions had ever issued a loan for your vehicle and no one ever saw the original title of your car, except You. I hope this make sense...

So, guess what will happen?! Yes boys, yes !!! Brokers, will order immediate cover of all the **Synthetic AMC shares** that are now traded and shorted daily and we don‚Äôt understand why the numbers make no sense.

**By May 4, absolute 100% of Synthetic AMC shares should be covered, no exceptions and excuses whatsoever!!!**

And of course you know what that means, right? Prepare for real take off apes, because this is what will happen really soon, no matter of any news and even if next week AMC will declare 100.000% loss for last year, this won‚Äôt affect the take off, because it‚Äôs smells shitty around and isn‚Äôt a joke anymore...

I personally believe that this trap is set by CEO and the management of AMC. Because as a management team, none of them can came in from of us and say that Citadel or Melvin HF‚Äôs are crocks and bad boys because they are shorting our stock... More than that, SEC is asking to declare long positions in any stock , a HF has, but there are No Legal ways to make these HF to declare Short positions in any of the stocks, in Europe HF need to declare more than 1% of the shorting, but in US not even 1 shorted share is declared....

**Keep in mind**: When a business appoints a new CEO to the role, one of the main requirement for the candidate is to ensure that the Share price will continue to increase and this will attract more investors to the business and will build a solid investors portfolio with reputable names among HF‚Äôs pension funds, any other trusts that are looking to put their cash in a long position for a stable business. And this is not an exception, no CEO is hired if he can‚Äôt demonstrate how he will take care of the business investors. Diluting a stock it‚Äôs like stealing From your investors packet, good businesses and long term oriented businesses don‚Äôt do this unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary....And before taking such a step, even if I would have 1 or 2 % of AMC ( as an example) I would wake up by AMC ceo calling me personally and bringing this potential news along with reasonable explanations and asking for my support, in order to protect my investment and the business itself...

**possible scenario :** before a take off, we can see a huge push downward, as HF‚Äôs will stay in Line to buy AMC shares under $5, this is their ideal level. So, prove me wrong ;) otherwise show me your Diamond Hands ;)

as I mentioned, on Monday we will have an incredible wall of selling just because of this Meeting from May 4. HF will do all they can, to generate panic among small investors. All HF need is under $6 for a couple hours or ideal will be under $5 for a couple hours so they can buy almost 50-70 millions shares to cover their short positions, and after that they will let it alone because people will wake up and understand that they have been tricked by HF and will start to buy again... This will be the worst scenario for us only and the best for HF.  
The best scenario for us is Diamond Hands no matter what comes on news feed on Monday, and to hold even if it goes to 15-20, then this will just explode and lose the control, we can see even $50 or $100 no matter how will be the earnings report...

Apes, I don‚Äôt want to Sell you Naked Hopes :))) but this are well balanced scenarios, and trust me, this is their best options, cause you can‚Äôt hide Synthetic shares that are shorted 3 or 4 or even 10 times...

The next 2 weeks are the best for us, we can have not gamma squeeze, we can jump on the squeeze right away. And the March 19 level of options will explode on Monday, HF will try not to generate a Buying panic, since they will try to generate Selling panic, so on Monday they will buy in bulk every and each available option expiring on March 19... The show will begin on Monday, enjoy ;)

N.B. I am not a professional trader, nor a financial advisor. I know what I know because I do a lot of DD when I invest in something and I like to see a step ahead, in order to have prepared an exit point. So please do your own additional DD in order to take one or another decision...

Obviously this isnt financial advise. don't buy or sell based off of anything i post here. 

&#x200B;

here goes. Buy out?

I got panicky when i saw that AMC was looking to create 500,000,000 more shares, so i did some reading on it. little bit of math. 

&#x200B;

 there's a lot of info in this mf....

The first thing I wanted to ask about was the significance of 500,000,000...roughly double existing right? its actually a little less but look at this...if ANY ONE PERSON was to buy those shares...like say they had a buyer lined up...wouldnt that give ONE person roughly 48.8% ownership of the company? doesn't that seem like a significant number for a buyout? that's just shy of the majority controlling interest. also there's more math shit.

&#x200B;

My next interesting read was this 

Right of First Refusal Agreement

Silver Lake and Wanda had a deal. And I have no idea what it means...so help me out. Please. click the original link and control+f the ""ROFR"" and it should pop up. My ape brain understanding is that, so long as Wanda and Silverlake had the controlling 50.1% in voting stock, they could limit AMCs ability to sell stock. 

With silver lake closing there position. Wanda doesnt have that ability anymore.

&#x200B;

With our accumulation of shares at retard speed, is it possible that we've been buying up ALL the shares...so much so that there's not anything for AMC to sell to someone who wanted to buy in...so that they have to CREATE 500,000,000 SHARES because they need to create a majority position to sell to someone who wants to buy?

FOR A BUYOUT. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Last thing. The last thing on my way out here is that there's a mention of reserving 35,000,000 shares at the end to AWARD. 

if we take the new total of shares, which would be 1,024,173,073 and subtract that 35,000,000 we get 989,173,073

what % is the new 500,000,000 shares created of that?

500,000,000/989,173,073 =

50.5%

i don't know anything about stocks really or company ownership shit. just someone tell me if this does or doesn't make sense, and why.

Dude got Clinton connections...and that's pretty strong ally. Also Palantir. that was a big buy in target for people recently, wasn't it? i did a small google search of what it is that they do or sell....survey says!

""What is Palantir product?

Mr. Lee E. Wittlinger

Mr. Lee E. Wittlinger, 37, has served as a director of the Company since September 2018. Mr. Wittlinger is a Managing Director of Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (""Silver Lake""), which he joined in 2007.



This guy was appointed as a babysitter on the board due to the deal lined out between Silver lake and AMC. Silver lake made some loan deal with AMC, this is the position they closed at the PEAK of the amc run. they made good money, and the selling of there shares seemed to close the debt owed by amc, so that's fine. How silver lake managed to time and sell stock at the absolute PEAK is beyond me. the timing is interesting.

regardless Silverlake seems to have liquidated there entire position, so long as they don't hold 25% of outstanding common stock, they cant hold a position on the board unless AMC wants to keep em around.

another thing to keep in mind is that Silver lake had AND sold 25% of AMCs outstanding common stock, at the PEAK of the run, RIGHT before Robinhood also STOPPED BUYING.

it seems like it could be possible that Silverlake sold out to hedge funds to close there positions? i hope not.

3/7/21 07:40,"Vanguard and Blackrock  

What do both of these companies have in common? Both have large institutional holding in AMC and GME. Both have ETF's that have significant amount of AMC and GME holdings in them. These ETF's generally have similar holdings in them in general too. It's not easy to find short data on ETF's but both of these companies ETF's that hold both GME and AMC stock seem to be heavily shorted.

I'm generally pretty low in knowledge on the workings of these kind of things so I hope someone can look into this further. Vanguards ETF's don't seem to have much option activity but Blackrock's do. One in particular is IWN which has seen significant short activity. It has a dividend due the week after 4 witching day and speculation is that ETF's with GME and AMC holdings can all call in their shorts at the same time due to tax implications on dividend payments. This could cause a huge short squeeze. Well if you look at the call options for IWN it has over 500,000 open interest contracts ITM at or below a strike of $230. That seems insanely high to me. Especially seeing that it's average daily volume is only around 28 million for the past 2 months. And highest daily was only 59 million.

Another thing I found extremely odd is that if you look at the high short interest list Vanguard and Blackrock have large holdings in basically all of the companies up top. AMC, GME, BBBY, STK, RKT, ASO, BYND, SPWR and the list goes on. I understand that they are two of the largest holding companies in the world but that still seems odd. Most of these companies have unusually high option activity on March 19.

I think what we are seeing is a direct attack on Vanguard and Blackrock holdings in general and GME and AMC are just along for the ride. Vanguard and Blackrock seem to be winning the fight too. Another point of interest is that both Vanguard and Blackrock have been outspoken about a green energy future. Could that be the reason for the attack on them along with the dip we've seen in green energy markets recently?",39094,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.940102696,True

3/7/21 02:59,"AMC next week‚Äôs OMG momentum REPOST - Hey all, 2900 ITM Holding. Not Your Financial Advisor. 

This coming week 8th-12th is set up to be huge. I‚Äôll tell you why in 20 important seconds. But first...

No May 4th‚Äôs shareholder vote on 500M Class A stocks being created does not affect the squeeze. 
- Class A are not traded on the open market. They are designed to provide the holder greater voting power (each share is worth more than 1 vote portion) keeping control in the hands of the company and not a institutional buyer looking to have too much power.  These also hold dividend priority and liquidity preference, not what has been shorted. The notice comments that this will not have any immediate affect of dilution. 
- Class A are largely used to help position a favoured potential parent company in such a way that the merger or acquisition is certain to occur. This could be a indicator of a possible Amazon or other takeover. 
- These shares won‚Äôt hit the market until months after the squeeze is squoze (not sure if that‚Äôs a word). May 4 is vote, takes time to ratify vote, board has to vote when they do want to add shares and by how many, SEC filings, private offering... historically 4-6 months if they wanted to put them out right away... but they use language suggesting no urgency. 

üìÑ[SEC Filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)for those that want to fall asleep or otherwise don‚Äôt believe me. 


Ok, so now that your heart rate has dropped a little and you are HOLDING and a good little ü¶ç, let‚Äôs discuss this coming week.

March 8 - Market closed above $8 again Friday so there are more options ITM to be purchased. This adds about 11M to the existing 14M (less since purchased) shares to be bought. We saw a nice spike the other day when one of the firms had to involuntarily settle some positions. Once a few positions have to be settled at the same time we‚Äôll see a huge steep incline which will put the hedges into a musical chairs situation. No a steep incline won‚Äôt be a steep decline as well (so why don‚Äôt they just wait) because we apes won‚Äôt be selling for a few $ profit when we can sell for many $$$$ profit. 

March 9 - FINRA Full Short Interest Report released. This will confirm the heavily shorted position on this stock which will fuel speculations of scarcity which could prompt the hedges to settle some (not all) positions. 

March 10 - AMC Q4 2020 and Annual Report (after hours). There is no surprise that they will have to report losses but they are forecasted to report fewer losses than expected which is technically gaining ground. The CEO was on yesterday (Friday) on a few shows and handled himself wonderfully including not being trapped into condemning us apes.  Not his words; ü¶ç = Loyal Supporters. He also confirmed the Wanda situation was an agreement and not any confidence shake up.  Remember that almost every company sees a lot of selling on earnings day, it‚Äôs just not good investing to hold a heavy position in something on earnings. We will see some dips before and after the reporting but not as much since most shares are owned by us apes and institutional buyers which are required to hold for 90 days (most were purchased less than 30 days ago). 

March 11 - Expect a lot of business savvy ü¶çs to be buying up the dip as well as a lot of position settling to occur as they hope to take advantage of what is likely to be the floor price (not lowest yet) moving forward. This date represents a stock price that will have all new information factored into it. There isn‚Äôt another earnings report due for 3 more months and by then the theatres are back at 100% and the hedges have long since paid us. 

March 12 - Expect by this date the Short Borrow Fee rate to rival that of your MasterCard. We close the week up at 11.6%. This is up from 4.3% market open at the beginning of the week. For reference, GME popped around 20% and Tesla‚Äôs 4x moment was at 18% a while back. 

üíé üôå HOLD Folks. I appreciate you reading this far and I can‚Äôt stress enough that you need to do your own confirmation research on anything you don‚Äôt know to be correct already. Yes we are being targeted in an effort to force us to sell... just HOLD. If you take your profits at $20 it won‚Äôt hit $200 or beyond. We control the stock. We know this because they have done everything they can and their efforts should have knocked the stock down to $2-$3. This is their business and they are exceptionally good at it... but us  ü¶çs are too retarded to follow their rules.

This is by far the best thing that could happen to us right now, and I truly believe this is the final punch in the HF stomach to get them to realise that they have lost the battle!!!

Listen to why:
Because of the announced upcoming vote EVERY SINGLE AMC SHARE has to be accounted for and has to have an owners name and e-mail adress standing behind them at the latest 11. of march, so that AMC can send out the invitation to the shareholder meeting in the coming week after that!!!

That again means that ALL THE IOU‚Äôs (fake shares) the HF have been creating to hold the share price down and make us believe that the fight is over, have to be destroyed, and that HF now will be forced to buy the actual share directly from the market (all of us) at whatever price we want!
They need the shares to give it back to the stockbrokers they borrowed it from in the first place in their attempt to short the stock and drive the price down (you all know that story!!), and because they are already late on that, they now pay a shitload of interest every day!!!!

What ever else you read about this issue, many bots are trying to make you believe, that the AMC CEO is screwing us right now, but I assure you, that is not the case!!!!

**As most of you remember earlier last month we had the big four AMC, GME, BB, and NOK, ring any bells?** I understand that a lot of you might be new to the page and subsequently lack this knowledge. **Why do I bring these stocks up you may ask ape brother? Well, I will tell you, my hairy friend, where has the relationship gone? Even two weeks ago we would see AMC and GME follow the same trends, mainly AMC would follow GME in movement, up or down. But in the past week, I have started to realize that the relationship no longer is three** (or at least what it was late last month). 

**Although this is a theory in the works, I will present to you brothers the plausible reasonings for this new trend.**

1) **HF are covering shorts on GME inorder to bite the bullet.** To explain this simply, AMC is still by far one of the most shorted stocks on the market to this day

**This is the most recent data shorts from 3/6. LOOK AT THE INCREASE IN SHORT POSITIONS??????** This is nothing to scoff at, **a 27.6% increase in the past month!**  üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ   This is after the fact **HF** are literally **down billions from the short positions** in the past two months. Just for reference **here is GME as of 3/6**

**GME shorts are down to -23.7% from last month** (I don't believe this is accurate though with positions being actively covered) This is crazy, **one of the most talked-about shorted stalks on our page has gone up 27.6% in shorted volume in the past month and NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT?????** 

**THIS SEEMS ODDLY SIMILAR TO THE PAGE MANIPULATION SEEN WITH GME AFTER THE FIRST SPIKE, AND THE RANDOM FLOOD OF 10,000 NEW RKT BUYERS!**

**Here is a link to Investopedia** (I know it's not the most reliable to normal humans but to apes, it's like the 10 commandments) [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp)

**Why is this significant?** 

**1) It shows something is kinds of sketchy...** Our community is built on great investments and currently shorted positions, so **why would one of the biggest stocks only a few weeks ago all of a sudden just tapper off?** AGAIN THIS IS A THEORY, BUT I THINK THERE IS MANIPULATION GOING ON!!!

**2) If the percentages are true, it seems that the HF have less to lose in AMC than they do in GME** at the moment. My guess is that they are in a sense t**aking the lesser of two giant peens in their ass.** *Why lose 50+ billion on AMC when you could manipulate the focus to GME and potentially see a greater loss.*

**3) Did we not forget that AMC is not only the largest theater chain in the world but they are now starting to recover from a global pandemic that inhibited profits for nearly an entire year??** I mean I'm no **hedgefuck** but common sense tells me that going from relatively 0 profit for a year, to suddenly the chance of starting up at full capacity would cause a greater P/L ratio than 10%!!!!

**4) AMC IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST SHORTED STOCKS ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!** I LOVE GME AND HAVE QUITE A BIT IN IT, BUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN AND SHOULD BE A PRIORITY AS MUCH AS GME.

**TL:DR: My theory is that HF are manipulating the page to divert attention from AMC to GME so that they don't have to cover TENS OF BILLIONS IN SHORTS. We have seen AMC stop following the same trends as GME in the past week, after weeks of being damn near the same graph. AMC continues to go up in % of volume shorted while GME is easing off short volume (IK WHY, BUT STILL LOOK AT MY POINTS) AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN APES!!!**

I am not an advisor I just like the community...

This Friday 03/05/21 at 7:30 PM, I was surprised to see the B/A for AMC at  300/29000. So, for the first time since getting on this ‚Äúrocket‚Äù on January 27th, and entering the market in December, I went to Edgar.  AND, It just so happened, that today, AMC had filed a notice for their shareholders meeting, at which a proposal to dramatically increase the shares of issued stock, will be voted on.

Here is a link to see the document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801\_proxy\_summary](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801_proxy_summary)

Here's a simplified gist of the summary:

1. **On January 27, 2021**, the AMC Board approved a Proposal to Amend their Certificate of Incorporation to increase the total number of shares of Common Stock they are authorized to issue an additional 500,000,000 shares to total 1,024,173,073 shares of Common Stock.
2. **On February 24, 2021**, they filed with the State of Delaware to *retire their class B common stock,* creating the current article of incorporation which authorizes them to issue up to  500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
3. **On March 5, 2021**,  an invitation to a shareholder meeting for **May 4, 2021** was filed with the SEC, whereupon the proposal, will be voted on.
4. The summary contains the following accounting ***as of close of business day, March 3, 2021***:  450,156,186  Shares of Common Stock, issued and outstanding\*\*.\*\* **Shares Reserved** ***that may or may not be*** **released prior to the EIP:**  **10,920,763** shares of Common  Stock,  **63,096,124** shares (*premium 50,000,000* \-  and *3,732,625 treasury*)
5. *So, for the next 8 weeks,*  then the RESERVED SHARES  are what may or may not be released, I guess.
6. On May 4, 2021 (assuming this is approved)  an additional 500,000,000  can be issued that would then total 1,024,173,073 shares.  The company may use these for private placement, public offerings, IPO's, stock splits, employee incentives, etc.

Can anyone enlighten me and/or assuage my concern? My concern being contained herein the potential Adverse Effects of Certificate of Amendment:

‚ÄúAdoption of the Certificate of Amendment will have no immediate dilutive effect on the proportionate voting power or other rights of the Company's existing stockholders. However, any future issuance of additional authorized shares of our Common Stock, at the future direction of the Board (and generally without the requirement of stockholder approval, unless specifically required by applicable law or NYSE regulation) may, ***among other things, dilute the earnings per share of Common Stock and the equity and voting rights of those holding Common Stock at the time such additional shares are issued.‚Äù***

The hedges need to cover their shit and they wanna try it by using US GOV stimulus (individuals‚Äô money) for fake rise of the stocks.

3/9/21 05:21,"Options Game on AMC is on FIRE right now!  Alright fellow simians, I am hoping we are evolving enough to where we can begin talking specifics in terms of the options market on our beloved AMC. I know many are hesitant, fearing that if specific prices aren't reached by Friday, younger apes in the pack may grow scared and begin to doubt our journey. I am hoping by now we have done enough research on the market itself to now understand specific pricing goals and not be discouraged by them if the week doesn't go as planned.

TLDR: If you are like me and data makes your snake hiss, or your cat growl for my ape sisters, stick around. If you're going to pout and take your ball home if we happen to miss a target price come friday, GTFOH...Sorry for yelling, I still love you, (bro hug).

Alright so as a nerd at heart a good spread sheet to me can beat a free premium pornhub account especially when it's a spreadsheet about boosting our AMC and speeding up the count down to our moon launch.

As you should all know, the options market and corresponding weekly Gamma squeezes will help push our rocket towards the launch pad much quicker than just the buy and hold campaign. Now, options are a different breed and can burn young gun apes bad so I am not suggesting playing ""just the tip"" with them if you do not fully understand the risk. Think playing said game with a cigar cutter...

Anyways, options have huge impact on stock price as each contract is for 100 shares. So the more contracts that are sold by market makers, the more 100x shares they must purchase the following monday at market price if the contracts are exercised. This is the foundation of Gamma. If you're not tracking and want to learn more, please reach out. Seriously, I'm not a weirdo, I'm not offering you free candy out of a sketchy van, I just know that the smarter our pack gets and learns the game, the worse it is for the Hedge Fucks. I am not an advisor, so I will not and do not give advice, but I will give information and hypotheticals for my ape brothers and sisters to make their own decisions.

In an earlier post this weekend I commented on how absurd (good thing) the options game is right now on AMC. AMC is now has the 11th most active options contracts. Yes, AMC, movie theaters. If you don't get why that is unfucking believable you must have been fortunate enough to be in a coma during the wet fart on first date of a year that was 2020 thanks to the rona.

Anyways, currently there are 5735 contracts ATM at 8.05 expiring this friday. That means 573,500 share become purchased by douche fucks like Ken Griffins Citadel the following monday, should all contracts be exercised. That's a lot of buying pressure in it's self.

Now at a strike of 8, if market prices is at or above 8.79 the number of options ITM is 27,688 or 2,768,800 shares at stake... how would you feel about that if you were shorted on AMC? Personally, I'd be curled up under my desk crysterbating while sucking my other thumb...

Below is a table I made listing the price at which options are ATM and the number of contracts that would be ATM or ITM at strikes below these are for all contracts sold expiring Friday (3/12):

7.98: 43 options ATM 4300 shares

8.03: 615 options ATM 65,800 shares

8.04: 3604 options ATM 360,400 shares

8.05: 5735 options ATM 573,500 shares

8.14: 8,054 options ATM 805,400 shares

8.38: 12,358 options ATM 1,235,800 shares

8.79: 27,688 options ATM 2,678,800 shares

Now sharing this info is meant to help shareholders know the power of the options game and keeping the weekly monday Gamma cycle going. I haven't done the research for this past friday. But the 8.01 buzzer beater that left me needing to change my jocks two weeks ago gave us a 14.5% jump that following monday.

""But why then are we still hovering around 8?!?! I want more and I want it now! Wahhh!""

Well that's because the HFs still had ladder attack power to push things back down by week's end. You beloved apes buying more stonk and holding it is taking that power away slowly. The less shares they have for ladder attack bullshit the more/longer that monday gamma price spike will hold.

As you can see above, things are good at almost any price above 8. But the 8 dollar call had a 10,000+ increase in the number of contracts sold at that strike last week compared to the week prior, hence the more than double resulting power compared to 8.38 (which is an 8 call sold a while back at a premium of .38 a share)

So for me personally, and not advising anyone to bandwagon, I'm going to be cheering for 8.80 at Friday's close so those 27,688 contracts containing 2,768,800 shares are ITM.

But even if it doesn't quite make it, I'll still have a smile ear to ear as I know the options ITM below are still pretty damn powerful in the fight against douche bags like Gabriel Plotkin and the rest of the Hedge Fucks...",39919,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.993009925,True

Lets take a worst case scenario. Disney, Paramount and everyone else in the world says 'go screw yourself"" to AMC. They get no new movies. Ever again.

""Yo, general public!"" Shouts out AMC! ""Were hosting a Marvel Avengers marathon for the next 35 days! Every fucking movie released by Marvel since 1913, we are playing, come check it out!""

You like the Dark Night? We got that.

Ever wondered why Frozen is just the Lion King rehashed into a Disney Princess for the fan girls who don't give a fuck about Mufasa? We will play them back to back with a live rendition of Macbeth an enlighten you to the truth!

AMC has so many movies, they could create a monthly subscription for you to go out and watch old shit on the big screen and rake in 50 times the profits they currently do for the next 1000 years!

3/11/21 16:17,"Just what exactly is a Hedge Fund? In light of today‚Äôs events, (or yesterday‚Äôs depending on where you live), I‚Äôve seen many new apes wondering what exactly a hedge fund is and why it was able to cause such a drastic drop in their stonks. I‚Äôm here to answer that question.

I myself am a relatively new member of this specific community, however, I was on WSB when the first run of GME commenced and I‚Äôm here for the second. However, I mostly am invested in AMC. Rather, I was in GME the first round, but am riding AMC this time and bought a little of GME on the dip today. Still, I have been investing for years, so I‚Äôd like to think I know what I am talking about. 

To put it simply, a hedge fund is a group in which  multiple investors get together to be able to invest aggressively and eliminate risk. The reason they are able to affect our stocks is because today, there were enough groups of them that got together and tried to cause a panic sell so that they could meet their short requirements. (More on that below) To delve a little deeper into what makes a hedge fund tick, I‚Äôve grouped it out a little bit.

In hedge funds, limited partners contribute money so that the general partner can manage it. The general partner then invests the money however they see fit and hope to make a return on the investment. Since there is more money to spend, the risk is not as great, and the hedgie can invest in riskier ventures. Then, once a profit is made, the general partner pulls out, distributes the earnings to the limited partners and keeps a cut for themselves.

Now the hedgies we deal with in GME, AMC, NOK and all the other were shorting these stocks when we got into the game. That means they were planning on making a profit from a stock that was decreasing in value. When shorting a stock, it has to hit a certain price, otherwise the investor has to keep buying in order to cover their loss. So, when the hedgies sold off today, their goal was to cause us to panic sell, resulting in their shorts being fulfilled and them turning their profits. However, most of us held and we recover quickly. (Some of you didn‚Äôt hold, and I am disappointed in you. Think of me as your wife‚Äôs boyfriend.) Had the hedgies successfully pulled this off, they would have made their profit and we would be finished. 

I hope this helps those of you who were confused out a bit. For more information, I‚Äôve included a link below.

2)UWMC is extremely focused to advance their tech side. They have 800 employees working on their technology to make processing mortgages quick and easier for their customers. They will steal a lot of market share away from others.

3)they pay a 4.5% dividend. No growth stock is making positive earnings let alone paying a dividend. This stock checks all the boxes of a perfect investment.

4) their ceo is very aggressive and about this business. You will never hear a ceo as ambitious and honest at the same time. Listen to his interviews and earnings call, you will get very bullish.

5) short sellers are pounding this stock down for months. Short interest is almost 20% and there will be a squeeze of all squeezes.

I have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of ""security"" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.

That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.

There's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.

I'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.

‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù

Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.

And let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.

So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.

Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! 

You know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.

Based on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.

Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.

Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!

3/11/21 04:10,"Tanger Factory Outlets (SKT) DD from Feb 10K ***TLDR:*** Stick to GME or AMC for quick tendies, buy SKT shares as a longer-term play (\~1 year-ish)

Tanger Factory Outlets Centers (SKT) was fucked during the onset of Covid and has been beat down by Banks and Hedge Funds on the belief that Retail is dead making Tanger the 2nd most shorted stock. I read over their February 10k and came away with a strong belief in them. Tanger seems to have a recipe that works with their outlet design and has made a number of smart consolidating decisions over the past quarters to ensure their continued existence while returning to Pre-Covid levels of sales and activity by January. Despite some claims that Tanger is the next GME I don‚Äôt see that case. It has the potential to explode later this year, with May or August earnings providing the action that could ignite the existing kindling, but Tanger is definitely a long-term hold stock rather than an FD or weekly options play. I would aim for a price of $20-$25 by summer's end.

&#x200B;

Below is my overview, cons, pros, and what I see as a reasonable future path.

&#x200B;

***Company Overview:*** Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and its subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. They are a fully-integrated, self-administered, and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers. As of December 31, 2020, their consolidated portfolio consisted of 31 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.9 million square feet, which were 92% occupied and contained over 2,200 stores representing approximately 400 store brands. They also had partial ownership interests in 7 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.

&#x200B;

***Cons:***

&#x200B;

**Getting fucked by Covid and negatives consumer trends related to their business model have made them the 2nd most shorted company behind GME:** The main factors behind their current position are that they have been fucked by Covid and the fact that they are at their core a collection of huge retail brand store fronts off the highway.

&#x200B;

**Tenant Bankruptcies and Defaults:** In context to Covid a large number of their stores were closed, some rents payments were delayed, and there was an increase in the number of bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers at their locations (an increase in recovered square footage from about 1.75% at end of 2019 to about 8.3% of rentable square feet in 2020). Some of the tenants went through liquidity hardships and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tanger recaptured approximately 903,000 square feet within the consolidated portfolio related to bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers, compared to 198,000 square feet during the year ended December 31, 2019.

As a direct result of the pandemic, bankruptcies, and restructurings discussed above, the Company's earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $47.3 million due to (1) write-offs related to bankruptcies and other uncollectible accounts due to financial weakness, (2) one-time concessions in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to lease structure, (3) reserves for a portion of deferred and under negotiation billings.

&#x200B;

**Most Likely will not Increase Rent:** Tanger‚Äôs leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain Tanger‚Äôs standard for high occupancy levels. The majority of Tanger‚Äôs leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents. Tanger has historically been able to renew many leases at higher base rents per-square-foot and replace underperforming tenants with new or existing tenants in Tanger‚Äôs portfolio. Given the current retail environment as discussed above, Tanger may choose to renew certain tenants or execute leases with new tenants at lower rental rates to maintain a high portfolio occupancy rate. This is some of their lease agreements include co-tenancy and/or sales-based provisions that may allow a tenant to pay reduced rent and/or terminate a lease prior to its natural expiration if Tanger fails to maintain certain occupancy levels or retain specified named tenants, or if the tenant does not achieve certain specified sales targets. Their occupancy at our consolidated centers has declined from 97% at the end of 2019 to 92% at the end of 2020. If their occupancy continues to decline, certain outlet centers may fall below the minimum co-tenancy thresholds and could trigger many tenants' ability to pay reduced rents, which in turn may negatively impact their results of operations.

&#x200B;

**Retail decline:** Certain retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet, and other forms of pressure on their business models.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Pros:***

&#x200B;

**Tangers Model/Outlet Centers:** Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores. Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third-party retailer. Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential while also allowing these brands to maintain a foothold in high-density population centers without a high-cost storefront.

Tanger‚Äôs consolidated outlet centers range in size from 104,009 to 739,110 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores (so outskirts of major cities). Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores. Most of their outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity. Additionally, their centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.

They have a diverse tenant base throughout their consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 manufacturers, brand name and discount apparel and home retailers.

No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of their combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2020, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2020, no single tenant accounted for more than 7% of their leasable square feet or 7% of their combined base and percentage rental revenues.

&#x200B;

Tenants:

Locations:

**Perk of REITS for dividends.** Because Tanger is a REIT the ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of their common shares. They also have to make distributions with respect to their then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of their taxable income each year. They froze their dividends in 2020 but reinstated them in early 2021 with a dividend of $0.1775 per share paid in February 2021. Because of this high dividend payout holding the stock at least gives the benefit of decent dividends while waiting for a potential squeeze.

&#x200B;

**Return from Covid:** As of December 31, 2020, 99.9% of total occupied stores in their consolidated portfolio had reopened, representing 99.9% of leased square footage and 99.9% of the annualized base rent.

(Checkout Tenants and location attachment)

A number of their tenants requested rent deferrals, rent abatements or other types of rent relief during this pandemic. For March 2020, Tanger offered all tenants the option to defer 100% of April and May rents interest-free, payable in equal installments due in January and February of 2021. Their rent collection rates on contractually billed fixed rents were significantly impacted during the second quarter but steadily improved during the second half of the year, as the Company collected approximately 63% of second-quarter billed rents, 91% of third-quarter billed rents, and 95% of fourth-quarter billed rents.

In addition, traffic during the fourth quarter represented approximately 90% of prior-year levels and increased to approximately 96% in January. Governmental mandates effective between late December and early-to mid-February impacted traffic at the Tanger Outlet Centers in Canada, and excluding those centers, domestic traffic was over 99% in January compared to prior-year levels. This is a ridiculously good sign that there returning to pre-covid levels of demand even though only 20% of the US has been vaccinated. With a stimulus bill passing on the horizon, pent-up consumer demand,  and a planned influx of people traveling along highways and going to vacation destinations where Tanger has outlets I would not be surprised if they had stellar summer earnings. This would be the gasoline for a potential share price jump but wouldn‚Äôt be enough to kick off a squeeze.

&#x200B;

Finally, let's talk about what I think could be the item that kicks off a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

***Share Repurchases :***

In May 2017, Tanger announced that their Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $125 million of their outstanding common shares as market conditions warrant over a period commencing on May 19, 2017 and expiring on May 18, 2019. In February 2019, the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $44.3 million of their outstanding common shares for an aggregate authorization of $169.3 million until May 2021. After purchases in 2019 and 2018 the remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $80.0 million. The Company has temporarily suspended share repurchases for at least twelve months starting July 1, 2020 as the June 2020 amendments to Tanger‚Äôs debt agreements for Tanger‚Äôs lines of credit and bank term loan prohibit share repurchases during such time and in order to preserve Tanger‚Äôs liquidity position.

&#x200B;

What does this mean? Tanger has a pretty sizeable share repurchasing power that is currently on hold due to their debt agreements from when they shored up their lines of credit and borrowing power in 2020. Because their share repurchasing power will be authorized until May 2021 there is a chance that at their 5/10 Earnings Report they could roll that ability forward to this next year (2021-2022) and when their share purchasing restrictions drop on July 1st, 2021 they could announce a share purchase program where just under 5 million shares could be bought back by the company. This would provide the desired squeeze effect and really put pressure on the shorts assuming they don‚Äôt take the time to cover between now and then.

&#x200B;

TLDR; AMC is being heavily shorted; AMC has potential to go to $40  Time to save AMC and make tendies while we‚Äôre at it. This is not financial advice; it was originally written in red crayons that I found shoved deep inside my nose. 

Ever since COVID came along and kept our wives' boyfriends from taking them to the movies, hedge funds have been shorting AMC. AMC was close to meeting its demise on several occasions until the sound of apes screaming ‚ÄúWe like the stock!‚Äù could be heard. The sounds grew louder with the cult-like chants. However‚Ä¶ one thing was missing: More Apes. This is where we come to you with the facts laid out smoother than your brain in hopes of showing you what could be the best investment decision of your life. Bananas will be flowing. Question is: Will you grab it or‚Ä¶ peel out?

First we will start off by reminding everyone that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of a few smooth-brained apes who like the stock, just like you. Now, why are we diamond handing AMC? 

**AMC has solid momentum.** To back this up you can look at the chart for this. The average volume has significantly increased. Months ago, the stock rarely had more than 10M traded a day. Now it's harder to find a day with less than 100m traded shares. In the same time frame, the price has gone from almost $2 to, at the time of this writing, $9.29. This means there‚Äôs more interest and liquidity in the stock. All good things for us. 

**Theatres are reopening.** A quick google search gives you dozens of links for theatres that have already opened their doors and allowed moviegoers back in to enjoy their favorite pastime. Biden has [stated](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/biden-all-u-s-adults-will-have-a-covid-vaccine-by-may-101867589951) that there will be enough vaccines for everyone by May, which will allow all theatres to open at full capacity. 

**Capital raised, debt reduced.** In January AMC raised $1.2b ‚Üê with a b, in funding and paid off $600m in debt. Which leaves them with a clean bill of health and a solid ground to build up from.

**Started A Streaming Service.** They have branched out into [streaming services](https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand) as well, with AMC Theatres On Demand. 

**The Chart Below Looks Amazing.** First off, it's showing a cup and handle as indicated with the yellow line. This is a bullish pattern for price and we officially broke out of the handle to the upside on March 8. If we break above the tip of the cup, there isn‚Äôt much resistance stopping AMC from filling a gap to $13 and continuing on to the $20 mark, which is where Vlad decided to manipulate (read:suppress) buying action in January.
Next, we have the elliott wave theory that AMC does a great job of following. At the very least, AMC looks like it will move up from $9 to $13; on the smaller degrees. But on the larger degrees, if we assume that Wave 1 was the January spike, then we are in the beginning of Wave 3, which under EW Rules, has a realistic target of $30-40. With enough volume, AMC could easily blow past the $13 up to $20 and eventually reach the $30-$40 range. 

https://i.imgur.com/ramEhoQ.png

**Blockbuster movies lined up/Pent up Demand.** With movies not being able to be seen in theaters, some have been put on the release back burner until they can get sufficient eyes to view them. Some of these movies include Coming 2 America, God VS King, Mortal Kombat, Black Widow & Tom Gun: Maverick.

**The discord bot don‚Äôt lie.** If it worked for DFV it can work for us!

https://i.imgur.com/nmbRPmi.png

**Short Seller Data:** Forget about the momentum and the technicals for a minute and lets talk ape to ape. We did some research and found that there is still a TON of short sellers on AMC trying to take our movie theaters away. They just won‚Äôt learn; we LIKE the stock; we LIKE our movie theaters; we WANT them to stay in business. Forget the technicals, AMC is a great buy & hold because it will keep a fundamental aspect of our social fabric intact. If theaters close down, where else will our tweens make their first sloppy moves? And don't you dare say microwave popcorn is better than the theater kind - yes, even after your wife's boyfriend reminds you he ""doesn't do salt.""

Comparing AMC to GME, AMC is being shorted a lot heavier than GME right now; the numbers don‚Äôt lie.  Take a look at what Harambe found: 

https://i.imgur.com/w6WCJag.png

Sources: Data in table from Ortex.com, iBorrowDesk.com, and fintel.io

**Fellow Smooth Brained Ape Definitions Key:**

**Free Float:** Number of shares available for trade
**Short Interest:** Number of tradable shares being shorted
**Utilization Rate:** Percentage of lendable shares that have been borrowed (most likely to short)
**Short Borrow Fee Rate:** The interest rate each borrower pays on shares borrowed for shorting purposes
**Days to Cover:** The estimated number of days it will take for shorts to cover their positions

**Harambe‚Äôs Heavenly Thoughts:** Although GME has a higher percentage of its shares on loan, AMC has more shares on loan in total that are being shorted (Compare GME‚Äôs 12M shares with AMC‚Äôs 67M shares shorted). On AMC, the shorts have already borrowed 100% of the shares available to borrow, while on GME is only at 72%. We looked at the data from January, and saw a similar spike in GME‚Äôs utilization, followed by a rapid drop before the price mooned. AMC seems to be setting up a similar scenario. Looking at the short borrow fee rate, it is now more expensive to short AMC than it is to short GME, which could increase the pressure on AMC shorts to cover. Also, AMC has a higher ‚ÄúDays to Cover‚Äù than GME, which means it will take shorts longer to cover, so the price spike could last longer.  What Harambe‚Äôs trying to say here is: Me like AMC. Apes stronger together. AMC to the moon.

tl;dr: The writers and DDers of this:

>Me, Ape 1: 1 contract, 90 shares. Bagholding some at $15 but bought in more at $10. 

>Ape 2: 40 contracts, 600 shares

>Ape 5: 40 contracts, 100 shares

3/11/21 13:02,"The Theories on Today's Drop Hey everyone! Today was obviously quite eventful, and it looks like we're gearing up for a very active Thursday and Friday. There have been a few differing theories & perspectives I've seen posted here on why the price of GME, AMC, and etc. plummeted and then recovered (though not fully) and I was thinking it'd be a good idea to collect some of the different theories in one place so we can assess their validity for ourselves. Here are the theories I've heard so far - will edit this post to add more if anyone in the comments suggests additional theories and can provide a rationale that *could* make sense. Also TLDR at bottom.

- The Short Hedgefunds Theory: The HFs that are shorting GME decided to flood the market with low-priced shares to drop the price down and get people to panic sell.
- [The Short HFs and Media Theory:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/) Beyond just the action from the shorting HFs, some people have also suggested that the media is in cahoots with these shorting HFs because of how quickly they posted about the price dropping. There have been a few pieces of evidence for this claim, but no real ""smoking gun"". Some of the evidence has been:
 1. Articles were coming out about the drop roughly 20 minutes after the drop started. Some people are suggesting this is too short of a timeframe to write and publish an article. I personally think this is inaccurate given how quickly I've seen the media publish articles about stock movements in the past, but that's just my opinion.
 2. Google indexed a news article about the drop 14 hours before it was posted. [Another user posted reasoning of why they think this isn't sufficient proof.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/gqin9qf/)
 3. There have been screenshots of an article that was posted about an hour before the drop happened, talking about the drop. I haven't been able to find the article with this timestamp so am skeptical of this + think it may be photoshopped, but I'm unsure who would lie about this and what their motivation would be.
- The Bullish Hedgefunds Theory: A bit similar to the shorting HFs theory, however, this theory suggests that the price drop was actually caused by HFs who are bullish on GME, AMC, etc - the same ones who some have theorized caused our current run-up in the first place. The evidence for this is that a massive amount of OTM call options were purchased when the drop occurred. I personally think this is the most likely scenario, as I don't see how that many options could be bought on the downswing by retail alone. That said, it could be that people were checking out the options prices while trading was halted and then made their purchases as soon as trading unfroze.

This is what I've seen so far - let me know if there's anything further I should add!

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.

**The Hedgefunds**

Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**

**The Media**

The media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our ""MEME STOCKS"" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**

**The Crayon Eaters**

Foremost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

**TL;DR**

Fuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

3/11/21 09:34,"When the real squeeze will happen(Answer) MUST READ Before I say anything:

I am not a financial advisor, and I just like the Stonk. But here‚Äôs my financial advice anyways.

We did it, we burned the hedges, but we‚Äôre not done yet. They need to burn at the stake for the things they‚Äôve done and said. People are excited because we got GME to 200+ (again). Guess what? Who the fuck even cares. It doesn‚Äôt end here, right now, many of you beautiful apes are getting a stimulus check from uncle Joe, regardless of whether you love him or love to hate him, that‚Äôs free money. Think about all the apes ü¶ç, like me and you, that are going to dump all their money into stonks. It‚Äôll be crazy. We thought $1000 was the goal. NO. We can go even higher. Because when life gives you a banana üçå you fucking eat that banana. Bananas make apes strong, when apes ü¶ç strong üí™ apes win. The real squeeze has only begun, we still got a week or two of hard fighting. Biden is set to sign the bill this Friday. Hopefully we get our bananas üçå the following week. 


I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve ever seen what a banana looks like when it‚Äôs squeezed really hard, but that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do to the short sellers. We‚Äôre going to make hedges look like a banana that was squeezed by fucking king kong.

Edit: And we‚Äôll use our profits to watch godzilla vs kong in AMC theaters.

Edit#2: We‚Äôre waiting on the stimmy, which will be signed Friday by Biden. Allow a week for everyone to get their money, but people might get before then. So we‚Äôre likely going to see some elevated volume and likely  prices from the 17th  onward.

Of course GME is one of the biggest or most noticeable ones but look at others - the dip is the same. Was there some news or was it a big, massive, ""UGE"" sell off by a single entity? Or.... my conspiracy theory brain is firing away but my logical self has to think this is normal and there is an explination.

Something happened at 12:17 and lasted until 12:40. You can see it in a lot of stocks. It's so precise. Exactly 12:17 and each bottoms the V at 12:40. Even the ones that are ""off"" are off by a like minute.

KOSS same time

RIOT very similar with a small spike 1/2 way down

TSLA - exact same dip

RKT crashes at the same time but doesn't follow the same dip pattern after falling

SPY a similar downtrend during the timeframe but times not exact

Only stocks I have looked at that haven't followed the dip so far are:  gold, crude oil, unmentionable coinage, ORCL, and Boeing dips but doesn't go straight down, it's buried in a bigger overall upswing for the day. I am sure there are more but what is the pattern?

**EDIT** \- **conspiracy theory**: I read that the PPT (plunge protection team) works during midday / lunch hour on their ""market corrections."" Could this be the government interfering to prevent a huge spike and following collapse that would require billions in bail outs should it squeeze?  I know they are not supposed to interfere with the market, but the belief/conspiracy theory is that they do. 

Either way - someone doesn't want GME back over $400. It's hard to believe that this could be tied to any other stock. (Of course, it could be coincidence, but COME ON MAN!) Of course, the correction afterward was pretty fast and furious so was it an attempt to stop or just stall?

Citing: 

Other Creditor Discussions. While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.


EDIT: I feel like I should respond here to some comments below:

\- Everything I said is factual. It's all linked to the official SEC docs of AMC or Bloomberg as a reliable source. 

\- Its a fact that share count increased to 450m. its a fact that roughly 50m shares are shorted.. .its a fact that even if you add in all the call options you barely get to any squeeze .. these are all facts

\- the fact that I have access to a Bloomberg terminal does not make any difference

\- If you really think I want to drive the share price by posting here.. sorry you are bloody stupid then. AMC trades like 2.5bn every day!!.. Mr bag holder dildo with his 50 shares has no influence lol 

\- yes my account is new. I looked at this once my friends asked me whether to invest in AMC or GME. I know AMC very very very well. I never looked at GME. 

\- I find it irresponsible that unsophisticated people with little money gamble away all their savings by being tricked into a Hoax

\- I did this post so ppl can get the facts right

&#x200B;

I have been flagging dilution at AMC before and I want to touch on this further in this DD.

# 1. AMC increased its share count from roughly 100m to 450m in the last few month alone.

This is a link to AMC latest quarterly release:

[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html)

**Lets count just how many shares have been issued:**

From the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves)

Which I estimate is another 6m.

ÔÉ® Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x

ÔÉ® And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)

# 2. Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares.

They have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come.

And ‚Ä¶ here it comes:

The company just filed an Annul general meeting to increase the share count by another 500m.

See this link:

[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html)

# Operationally it‚Äôs a severely struggling business:

\- The company burned through 125m a month in Q4

\- That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call.

\- They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast

\- Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent

\- Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today‚Äôs share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution ‚Äì pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD

\- Remember AMC wasn‚Äôt even able to generate any cash pre- covid

\- The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless

There is not even that much squeeze potential:

# Lets look at the facts:

# 1. Stocks shorted 55.5m ??

That is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float‚Ä¶. And compares to 260m shares traded yday.. so to cover all shorts you need about 20% of the daily volume.

Stock is liquid to borrow

&#x200B;

short interest

# 2. But what about a gamma squeeze ???

Again lets look at the facts.

The open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts.

Lets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don‚Äôt exist.

1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares‚Ä¶

Many of these calls are out of the money..

But hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money.

That is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!

Also this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.

More realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls.

This is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there.

The reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn‚Äôt.

&#x200B;

3/11/21 19:14,"AMC to the moon fellow gorillas, correct me if I am too retarded for math Info from the CEO on AMC outstanding shares is huge!

450mil-287mil= synthetic shares 163mil

Current short intrest is calculated in function of the outstanding shares, data shows 25.68% as of Feb 26, could be more if manipulated (shorting ETFs)

0.2568\*450mil=115.56mil shares short

(actual short intrest (possibly higher if the 25% is manipulated): 115.56/287=40%

Shares that need to be bought at some point:

115.56+163.56+(Expiring call options)=278.56 mil

Expiring call options included, more than a 100% of existing shares need to be bought.

The Hedgies shifted the problem by diluting the outstanding shares and shorting ETFs(which does not show on the short intrest)

Why did the utilisation, number of shorts available and the fee go down:

They created fake shares and dropped it into the market (remember they are in survival mode). People bought those shares. Their broker can use those shared to lend them to be shorted (utilisation down). Price down and more shares available for shorting->less risk shorting ->shorting fee went down.

Yes I did analyze the heck out of DTCC. COMMON SENSE 3 ( long read for those that care, or the ones on the fence about pushing the sell and lose button)

DTCC, stimulus, loyal base, summer movie hits, the entire country opening, immunizations... We all know 4th qtr earnings are going to suck because of Coivd. So what.. it‚Äôs over. And that is past news. Let me remind you all. AMC is up about 30 percent this week. Why ? We all freaking know the Ape army and the general public is going to pour into amc and our rival/Gme. DTC is coming 8-60 days all depends if the sec submits a rebuttal. That is a GAME CHANGER FOR AMC. The hedge fund golden spoon boys who sucked daddy‚Äôs credit card and went to Harvard and MIT are fukeddd. Bank ain‚Äôt gonna lend you that much and they are gonna have the ability to call for Funds at anytime. This will change the game and at a minimum push up the stock. We also have the usuals. America opening, Coivd vaccinations, movie lovers wanting to go back with their families. AMC has a better foundation then gme. 

Important!!! Hey guys and gals think about it.. AMC is a 110 year old company. Survived world war 1 and 2 and Spanish flu. It‚Äôs a solid company about to pop during the summer (we all know this) 

If some people think amc is a crazy meme stock ... well .. b I t c o I n is an imaginary digital currency. If you think about it to much you‚Äôll get a headache and it actually doesn‚Äôt even exist in the real world: yet how much is it worth ?? Exactly..,, for all the AMC bitch haters. AMC was not worth more then 20 dollars in 2019 because it wasn‚Äôt a hot stock, it wasn‚Äôt tech, it wasn‚Äôt Amazon , it wasn‚Äôt trending. Guess the fuck what ? It‚Äôs hot now amd will sizzle Into the fall. Entertainment is the tech of 2021. AMC profits in the upcoming qtrs will crush expectations. 

Go ... go to the movies . Nothing good playing ? Our money is playing. Watch a cartoon dragon, watch a silly love story, watch a car get blown up. Get out to the AMC movies!!! Common sense.

The biggest news coming out of the call is how, ""absolutely"" BULLISH the CEO is about AMC's future and the Key actions that the Team has put in place to move it forward.

Key Takeaways:

* Raised $2.2B in Cash.  Operating cash will last easily into next year based on their very conservative estimates.
* Negotiated $1.6B in creditor and land lord concessions.  This is a big deal and will significantly impact cash burn.
* 90% of U.S. locations now open.  New York has been a BIG success and their biggest market Southern California, including the critical L.A. DMA, is expected to open as soon as a few days from now.  
* Pent up demand is huge based on their research and what they experienced with the New York reopening.
* Over 40 major movie releases, including block busters like Top Gun 2, that were held back in 2020 are now in que to be released in 2021.  This in itself will drive box office.
* Vaccinations have taken off and AMC is leading the industry on operating standards for safety and cleanliness.

The bottom line is the Company is now a MUCH safer long term play.  Remember AMC is the class of the industry to begin with.

AMC is only up 5x and holding $10.25 WHICH is possibly bullish. So, we can all pop a prozac and go the movies and escape our sour thoughts on missing out on the GME frenzy :) ..

3/14/21 01:39,"The Neurobiology of Autism and its link with the GME saga. My dear fellow apes,

I couldn't find any thread discussing this but I believe this is a topic that can't be overlooked as it surely explains why many of us are bonding and showing similar behaviours in this GME / AMC saga. Plus, it may also explain why this is probably one of our greatest strength.I'm myself diagnosed Asperger myself and have spent years researching on the matter as I needed to understand why I couldn't feel and think the way my friends would. I'm sure I'm not the only one here.

SO...

# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?

&#x200B;

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)

\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.[https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders)*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) \*spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.

&#x200B;

**Prevalence**

\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. ([Buescher et al., 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-09/autism-costs-more-than-2-million-over-patient-s-life.html))

\- Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)) Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\-  25% of 4500 children showing ASD symptoms participating in a study were not diagnosed and didn't know know they're affected. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255)

\-  ASD can be seen on brain MRIs, ASD brains physically developed differently.¬† [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/)

# ""Ok that's a lot but not all of us here have ASD... Even if one 1/54 or 1% of us on here did, how could this be proven and mean anything anyway?""

Well, the pourcentage of ASD apes on here is likely to be **higher** than in those studies... Why?

**Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder**\*""Social Media use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population"".In a 2013 study\*[*,*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000708) *researcher* ***Micah O. Mazurek*** ***found that the majority of adults with autism use social media to meet friends.***[^(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Social media use among adults with autism spectrum disorders***The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social‚Äìemotional correlates of social media use in adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness.* ***The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6%) used social networking sites (SNS)****, and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships.*

**Social Media help autistic children navigate the world***Dr. Szatmari: the human face doesn't have the same drawing power for an autistic child, and that something about technology triggers the motivation that's lacking in face-to-face contact.* ***This can really have a big impact in helping people with ASD navigate the world and be able to do things that we never thought possible before.***[^(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)

**Yale study: 'Social media boosts friendship quality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder'**[^(https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)](https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)

If you do some research, you will see that there's many other studies explaining why social medias are one of ASD favorite way to connect and communicate.

Maybe it would be interesting do a pol to see who's diagnosed or feel like being misdiagnosed here...

# ""Yeh ok but what's the link with GME or the stock market then?""

That's where things get interesting...There are hundreds of studies out there showing that **reward pathways** of autistic people are altered and therefore their social¬†relationships but also their **relationship with money** is totally different than the TD brains.

**Reward Circuitry Function in Autism During Face Anticipation and Outcomes***The aim of this study was to investigate reward circuitry responses in autism during reward anticipation and outcomes for monetary and social rewards.* ***During monetary anticipation, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) showed hypoactivation in right nucleus accumbens and hyperactivation in right hippocampus, whereas during monetary outcomes, participants with ASDs showed hyperactivation in left midfrontal and anterior cingulate gyrus.*** *Groups did not differ in nucleus accumbens responses to faces. The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes.* ***These results add to the growing body of evidence that autism is characterized by altered functioning of reward circuitry.*** *Additionally, atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features.*[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)

**Risk-Aversion and Rationality in Autism Spectrum Disorders***Risk-aversion and rationality have both been highlighted as core features of decision making in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study tested whether risk-aversion is related to rational decision-making in ASD individuals. ASD and matched control adults completed a decision-making task that discriminated between the use of risk-averse and rational strategies. Results showed that overall, ASD participants were more risk-averse than control participants. Specifically, both groups made similar choices when risk-aversion was the less rational strategy but* ***ASD participants chose more rational options than control participants when risk-aversion was the most rational strategy. This study confirmed that risk-aversion is a core feature of ASD and revealed that ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences.***[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)

**Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders**\*‚ÄúParticipants with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not when social reward, was¬†at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to both rewards.\*¬†***These data indicate that the reward circuitry is compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary conditions,*** ***which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.‚Äù***[^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)

# ""Cool but it says ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences... so it could also mean you could paperhand?""

Well, not exactly...

**Emotional decision-making in autism spectrum disorder: the roles of interoception and alexithymia.** [^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)""*These results demonstrate that although framing effects are associated with interoception and alexithymia in the neurotypical population,* ***emotional and interoceptive signals have less impact upon the decision-making process in ASD***\*.""\*

**Trait Autism is a Better Predictor of Empathy than Alexithymia***The study found that having more autistic traits is associated with lower empathy ‚Äì even after factoring alexithymia into the analysis. In fact, the study provides some of the* \*\*\*best evidence so far that autism is definitely linked to lower empathy.\*\*\***Autism and Reactions to Provocation in a Social and Non-social Context**[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)*Compared to Healthy controles, individuals with ASD showed similar externalizing behavior in the social context.* ***In the non-social context*** *(meaning non physical environment)* ***reactions after provocation were enhanced relative to non-provoking situations.*** *The findings implicate that the context is an important influencing variable when comparing individuals with ASD to HCs after being provoked.*

See where I'm going?

# ""Ok but it still doesn't mean you wouldn't give up at some point?""

ASD mostly characterised by Restrictive and Repetitive behaviours. We get even more obsessed when it comes to things we enjoy and distract us... or rather keep us in focus.

And what do ASD love more than everything? Yes Cramer, that's exactly what we like, the stock... because we love video games!

**The risk for pathological video game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD ('traditional') adults**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development***Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/)

**Video games from the perspective of adults with autism spectrum disorder**The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%).  *To the moon, right?*[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581)

**Restricted and repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/)

# ""Mmmmmh... but if all of this is just a game to you, you'll still end up turning off the console when you'll realise you might not get what you want?""

Nope, not really... the funny thing about ASD RRBs is that we are excited by the reward anticipation itself, not the reward. As long as the adversaire isn't down its knees giving up, we won't turn off the console. Plus, the thing we'll miss the most and regret while being millionaires is the entertainment and excitement itself.

**Common alterations in sensitivity to type but not amount of reward in ADHD and autism spectrum disorders**\*'The results, while not supporting hyposensitivity to changes in reward amount in ADHD and ASD, do suggest that both groups are generally less motivated in settings where social as opposed to monetary rewards can be earned.'\*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/)

**Money motivates in autism, attention deficit**'*They also perform better when the reward is greater: for example, 15 cents rather than 5, or comments such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a star‚Äù as opposed to ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù'*[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/)

**Autistic Traits Affect Reward Anticipation but not Reception**[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x)

I've lost a link to an amazing study showing that ASD individuals were more generous when it came to sharing their monetary reward with other participants compared to control. If anyone finds it, please post it in the comments :).

# Conclusion

Hedgies can try manipulate the ASD apes we are with FUD or any other techniques; ASD brains won‚Äôt react. We don't show improvement with hours of therapy not using reward as stimuli. And our stimuli here... well they are trying to take it away from us so all it does is increasing our obsession and make us buy more.

Anyway, I have no idea if all I just put together makes sense or is accurate but as having ASD, I'm relating to all of these facts 100%.

I also understand that there might just be only 10 of us with ASD here, as well as there could be 100k  but if you are not ASD and call yourself autist, make us proud with your diamond hands!

There's one thing I'm sure tho, it is that I love you all beautiful apes.

3/14/21 00:40,"Wanda AMC hypothesis AMC filed Wanda's intent to convert it's class B shares into class A shares on Feb 5th to the SEC. AMC's CEO recently stated that this was triggered by share dilution causing Wanda's majority shares fell below 30% and currently only sits at 9%. On March 10th it seemed like shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow rate plummeted. If you assume that the filing becomes official on the first business day after filing then it would have been official Feb 8th. If you count 30 days from Feb 8th then it would be March 10th. On March 10th it seemed that shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow plummeted. 

Is it possible that Wanda had a 30 day period where they weren't allowed to sell shares? As a matter of fact it seems that Wanda may have sold ALL their shares all together. Motley Fools' website lists institutional ownership as of March 13 and Wanda isn't listed at all. 

Another thing I read is that Class B shareholders are the last to receive any compensation if the company goes bankrupt. Why would Wanda ok the dilution of AMC's shares knowing it would cause them to lose the majority control they paid 2.6 Billion dollars for? Could it be that AMC fully anticipated going bankrupt prior to the reddit rally? I know that hypothesis doesn't jive with what was said in the shareholders meeting but I don't think anything they said necessarily disproves anything I've hypothesized. Nor would anything they said be a lie. They did very specifically point out that Wanda's position was held as of March 3rd. 

Why is March 3rd significant? That is 30 days from Feb 1 which is the day that the original reporting states that Wanda announced to AMC they would be converting shares. Would the same 30 day rule apply? They had to wait 30 days to disclose to the company their intent to sell and then 30 days from the SEC filing date to officially sell?",41472,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.953562558,True
3/13/21 11:23,"$HRB H&R Block - Buy some leaps (Part 2) Last month I wrote a post on why I'm buying $HRB leaps ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llok83/hrb_hr_block_buy_some_leaps_and_forget_about_em/)). My main reasons were: 

1. Pivot from brick & mortar to digital which could lead to higher sales multiples
2. Their $3.5b stock buyback program which still has $600m to go and will run through June 2022 (for reference: their current market cap is $3.84b)

Today, H&R Block announced 4 new Vice Presidents that will help drive the next phase of growth for the company. Among them are:

Karisa Booker, who previously led a complete consumer data transformation of AMC's marketing

Scott Runkel, who was head of product at Walmart and led the team responsible for ""defining quality standards for digital products."" 

These appointments reaffirm H&R Block's commitment to a digital transformation.

In addition to pivoting to digital, I believe that HRB's new focus on small businesses will greatly improve its bottom line. Some of you might wonder, there over 200 million tax paying individuals in the USA but merely 30 million small businesses, why should they focus on small businesses?

I think the answer is quite simple: most **individuals only file their taxes once a year,** and there are plenty of free do-it-yourself options for them. On the other hand, **businesses pay taxes year-round.** Payroll, sales tax, income tax, bookkeeping, many of which will require services that could generate more revenue compared to individuals doing their income tax one time a year.

HRB is expected to bring in $3.55b of revenue in 2021. Currently, it has a PS ratio of **1.42**, compared to their competitor Intuit (TurboTax)'s **13.65**. Intuit Inc ($INTU) trades at $395 with a market cap of over $108b. There's no doubt in my mind that the upside will be tremendous if HRB can successfully pull off the transformation. 

HRB released earnings on March 8th and reported a -$1.17 EPS for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of -$1.29. The call transcript can be found [here](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/09/hr-block-hrb-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/).

Fun Fact: HRB's CEO Jeff Jones was briefly the President of UBER in 2017 but quit during the #DeleteUber movement which took aim at the company's gender bias and toxic culture in the workplace. Jeff cited ""differences over beliefs and approach to leadership"" as his reason for resigning. Four years later, under Jeff's leadership, HRB scored 100% on the Corporate Equality Index and is recognized as one of ""Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality.""

Thing is, I wanted more. With the price so high, I was looking at Options. I was looking at GME a week ago. It was trading at 138. I went to buy a Call Option at 40 with a strike price of 140. Let's say I sold it at a price of 280. That option would have been 10k in the money! Unfortunately I have to say ""would have been"" because I did not buy that option.

This week I decided to start small, grab one Call on AMC with a strike price of 12. The price just hit 14, so that option was about 200 in the money. Nice start. Needless to say, I went to buy the option and was denied. Oh sure, I had been approved for options trading. Buy only at Level 1, which paradoxically doesn't allow you to actually buy options. Does that make sense to anyone? Don't ask me for experience, assholes. You're creating a Catch-22. How can I ever get experience if you won't let me try?

If anyone knows a place with enough integrity to give the little guy a chance, I would love to know. I deserve a chance to learn.

3/15/21 23:29,"Why AMC is not the same as GME Ok retards, listen up. Just because AMC has performed in lockstep in the past with GME does not mean this will continue indefinitely.

AMC is not GME. AMC‚Äôs management has issued a massive amount of shares proportional to previous outstanding shares to pay down their loans and rent, taken on new European debt, and the largest share holder has reduced from >50% to <10% stake. AMC will survive, but only because new shareholders are bailing them out by paying pre-dilution prices for new share offerings which directly allow the company the cash needed to pay their landlords. You aren‚Äôt buying value or even contributing to a war chest that can be used for expansion, new shareholders who bought ATM offerings are giving the company cash just to survive. If you love the chain, want to contribute your money to their survival, and are aware of the dilution of outstanding shares (quoted at 450.2 million outstanding during the earnings call last week) then more power to you.  However, if you think AMC is anything like GME you have another thing coming. At least GME has a short squeeze thesis that management isn‚Äôt actively sabotaging by issuing shares and Robert Cohen represents hope of future growth beyond what is possible for the business at present.

If you feel differently I would be happy to hear why you believe this company can increase shareholder value to compensate for the share dilution. Please let me know what I‚Äôm missing.

3/15/21 11:01,"Alright - the other guy did an intro to options. Here's an intro to spreads. # Updated with link to options intro and information at the bottom of the post

**I'm going to teach you guys about call/put spreads.**

In this guide, we'll use AMC as the example. Let's pretend it is currently trading at $9.28.

# First, some terms you should know:

Option: a contract that gives you the OPTION to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) on a certain date

Premium: The per-share price paid to the option contract seller for the option

Underlying: The stock on which we are trading options

Long: Means that we are BUYING an option

Short: Means that we are SELLING an option

Call: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to BUY 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price

Put: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to SELL 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price

&#x200B;

Now, how can we make money with a small account balance?

# If we have a BULLISH outlook (AMC goes to $13 because Stonks go up üìàüìàüìà)

# 1. YOLO calls (maximum gains, maximum risk):

Buy an out-of-the-money (OTM) call for an expiration date and hope the gamble goes your way.

**A long $10C 3/26** ($10 dollar strike call expiring on March 26) position trades for a premium of $1.49 a share, which gives us a total price of $149 per contract (100 shares at $1.49 per share).

This contract is out of the money - meaning the strike price is above the current trading price.

This is a straight up gamble. If AMC doesn't reach the strike price, the option expires worthless, because buying 100 shares at market price will be cheaper than exercising your right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. In that scenario, we have lost the premium we spent to buy the option.

As $AMC‚Äôs market price approaches the strike price of $10, the option‚Äôs value will go up ‚Äì meaning you could sell the option at a higher premium than you paid for it.

However, we will still lose money on this trade if the price doesn‚Äôt go above $11.49. That can be calculated by adding our per-share premium to our strike price. Since we paid $1.49 per share for the contract at a $10 strike, we need to recoup the premium of $1.49 per share. Hence the breakeven stock price is $11.49.

If AMC manages to hit $13, we‚Äôll be able to exercise the option (and purchase 100 shares at 11.49 each) or sell the contract for the market rate of around $3.00 per share. If we exercise the option, we could immediately sell the 100 shares at market price of $13, earning us $13 - $11.49 = $1.51 per share, or $151 total.

**Net investment and max risk: $149 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $11.49 ($10 strike + $1.49 premium)**

**Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 ‚Äì $1.49) x 100**

&#x200B;

# 2. Debit spread (limited gains, lower risk)

This option strategy is a two-tiered approach. In short, we open both a long and a short position at different strike prices.

Let‚Äôs say we think AMC will go up to around $13 by 3/26.

We can **buy**, or **open a long $10c 3/26** position, which trades for a premium of $1.49 per share ($149 per contract). This is out of the money.

We then **sell** or **open a** **short $12c 3/26** position, which trades for a premium of $1.00 per share ($100 per contract). It‚Äôs also out of the money, but since we are selling it, we get the $100.

Net-net, we spend $49 per contract here, which significantly reduces our risk profile and makes our break-even price much lower. Now let‚Äôs see what happens:

**AMC @ 13**

If AMC hits $13, both of our options are in the money. The $10c will be worth 3.00/share, and the $12c will be worth $1/share, which means when we close the options, we collect $300 and pay $100, giving us a gross profit of $200. If we subtract our initial cost of $49, we get a net profit of **$151**. Important to note that our profits are capped at $151/contract since we only have a spread of $2 between the strike prices.

**AMC @ 11**

If AMC hits $11, only our long contract is in the money. The $10c will be worth $1.00/share, and the 12c will be worthless. This means we can close our options and pocket the difference, which is **$51.**

**Net investment and max risk: $49 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $10.49 ($10 strike + 0.49 net premium)**

**Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 ‚Äì 1.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.49 x 100)**

**Net P/L at $10: +51 per contract ($1.00 ‚Äì 0.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.49 x 100)**

# If we have a BEARISH outlook (AMC goes to $6 because fuck AMC, all my homies hate AMC üìâüìâüìâ)

# 1. YOLO Puts (maximum gains, maximum risk)

A **long 8P 3/26** position trades for a premium of $1.05 per share, so $105 per contract.

Like the YOLO call, this is a gamble, and if you don‚Äôt have a lot of equity in your account, it‚Äôs unwise unless you have a really good feeling, or it came to you in a dream.

The same principle with breakeven prices applies here. Our 8p costs 1.05 a share, so for us to break even, the share price needs to reach $6.95 (8 ‚Äì 1.05). To exercise this option, we would buy 100 shares of $AMC at market price of $6.95, then sell those shares to the sucker on the other end of our option for $8 per share.

If the price doesn‚Äôt go below $8, our option expires worthless.

If the price hits $5.50, we can exercise the option: Buy 100 shares of AMC at current market price ($5.50) and then sell them for $8 a share (our strike price). Alternatively, we can sell the option for the market price, which would be around $2.50, netting us $1.45 per share.

**Net investment and max risk: $105 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $6.95 ($8 strike ‚Äì $1.05 premium)**

**Net P/L at $5.50: +145 per contract ($2.50 ‚Äì $1.05) x 100**

# 2. Another debit spread (limited gains, low risk)

Again, we use the same approach with spreads as before.

We can open the same **long 8p 3/26** position for 1.05/share, and simultaneously open a **short 6p 3/26** position for 0.33/share. That gives us a total cost of 0.72 per share, making our breakeven price 7.28 (8 - 0.72).

The spread is the maximum potential gain per share. So even if AMC tanks and goes below $3-4 a share, our maximum profit potential doesn‚Äôt change after it drops past 6.

Let‚Äôs see the math:

**AMC @ 5.50**

Both of our options are in the money. The 8p will be worth 2.50 per share, and 6p will be worth 0.50 a share. When we close the options, we collect $250 for selling the 8p, and pay $50 for closing the 6p, for gross earnings of $2.00 per share. If we subtract our buy-in of .72, we are left with 1.28 per share as our profit or **$128**.

**AMC @ 7.00**

Again, here only our long position is in the money. The 8P will be worth 1.00 per share, and the 6P is worthless. We can close the option out and pocket our difference of 0.28 per share, or **$28.**

**Net investment and max risk: $72 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $7.28 ($8 strike ‚Äì 0.72 net premium)**

**Net P/L at $5.50: +128 per contract ($2.50 ‚Äì 0.5) x 100 ‚Äì (0.72 x 100)**

**Net P/L at $7.00: +28 per contract ($1.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.72 x 100)**

# What if we have a NEUTRAL OUTLOOK?

We can still make money using a covered call, but we need a bit more capital to start.

First, we need to buy 100 shares of AMC at 9.28, which makes our cost basis (what we paid for it) $928.

If we think that the share price will trade mostly sideways, we can open a **short, covered call** position. This means we are selling the option for a buyer to purchase our 100 shares from us for a given price.

In our example, we open a **short 12C 3/26** position, which means we agree to sell 100 shares of AMC on 3/26 for $12 a share. The premium for this contract is $1.00 per share, so we pocket the $100. We keep this $100 no matter what, and we can use it to offset our cost basis. So regardless of what happens, our new cost basis for 100 shares of AMC is now $828.

Let‚Äôs see what happens on 3/26 when the contract expires:

**AMC @ 10**

The 12C contract expired worthless ‚Äì nobody is going to exercise a 12c when the market price is only $10.

Thus, our net gain is $**172.** We made 0.72 per share on each of our 100 shares as the price rose to $10, **and** we keep the $100 premium we were paid for selling the 12c.

**AMC @ 11.99**

The 12C contract still expired worthless. Our net gain is **$371** ‚Äì we made $2.71 on the share price rising and keep the $100 premium.

**AMC @ 14.50**

The 12C contract ended up in the money, which means that it will be exercised. Now, we sell our shares at $12 a share, earning $1,200. We also get keep the premium, so our total proceeds are $1,300. We do lose out on the potential unrealized gains we would have had if we were free to sell the shares on the market for $14.50.

Once the contract expires, we are free to do what we want with the shares: sell them for a profit or sell another covered call.

**Link to original** [post on options](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/)

**A word of caution on debit spreads: PIN RISK**

Let's run through our debit put spread example again.

On 3PM Friday 3/26, AMC is around 9.00/share. Both the 8P you bought and the 6P you sold are worthless. However, what you don't know is that contracts can be exercised until around 5:30 EST on the day of expiry.

So - if AMC closes at 8.90, and then crashes to $5 around 5PM, both of your options are ITM. Now, the buyer of your short position will exercise their option, meaning they will sell you 100 shares at $6 a share. If you aren't paying attention or your broker sucks, your long position, which should cover it, will expire.

Now you're on the hook to hold up your obligation, and you've lost the leverage you had beforehand.

There is really only one way to prevent this. **Close your spreads before 3PM on Friday of expiration.** You might lose out on some of the last-minute moves, but consider it an insurance payment. Otherwise, you might check your broker on Saturday to see your account blown up.",41678,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.996061623,True
3/15/21 10:01,"$NOK (Nokia) DD. Big week ahead with other recent news. Maybe fourth time posting is the charm. Alright smooth brains, strap in. This is going to be a wild ride. I said I wouldn't post more $NOK DD...I lied.

Obligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.

My position: I'm in for a bit over 2,500 shares and 211 calls.

This is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.

***1. Open Options expiring 3/19***

I've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)

Why that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

The second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.

This all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.

**The ""finish line"" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.

Bonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.

**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**

I thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.

First, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)

Second, in the same vein as the previous one. It looks like India is going to institute a Huawei ban.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials)

Lastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML)

There are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:

\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.

\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.

\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.

\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.

\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.

Lastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, ""WSB Short Bus Yellow"". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.

TL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week. We almost saw $10 print in January, and all the factors, if not more, are in play this week.",41680,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.997759104,True
3/15/21 08:40,"Simplified FOMC Playbook for Smooth Brains **How to play FOMC this week**

Haven‚Äôt really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn‚Äôt repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. The Federal Reserve will post the changes on the ~~16th~~ 17th (Wednesday-shout out datguypete for catching that) at 2 PM EST. I did a quick browse on WSB to make sure this post wasn‚Äôt repetitive, and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*

**I‚Äôve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don‚Äôt want to read this, I‚Äôll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**

My final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*

If you haven‚Äôt kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I‚Äôll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don‚Äôt throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There‚Äôs a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.

**Types of Bubbles:**

**Commodities** 

Moon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won‚Äôt see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. 
The Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We‚Äôve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.

**Housing bubble**

Residential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn‚Äôt a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won‚Äôt let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.

**Stock market** 

Very clear and everybody knows it, but it‚Äôs not about if, it‚Äôs about when. Unlikely they‚Äôll let it fail right now. Most likely won‚Äôt crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.

**Credit Bubble** 

QE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won‚Äôt let this fall because it‚Äôll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.

**Economic bubble**

Related to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won‚Äôt let this pop right now because we‚Äôre finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.


So as you can see, we‚Äôre in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.


**Things to watch at FOMC:**

**Yield Curve Control**

Increases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We‚Äôre already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.

**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** 

When covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don‚Äôt worry it doesn‚Äôt matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. 

Recently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can‚Äôt afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.

Rather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there‚Äôs inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.

**4 scenarios and how to play them:**

**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**

Play REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I‚Äôd be cautious tho. Because there‚Äôs a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we‚Äôre in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I‚Äôd play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I‚Äôd begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I‚Äôd start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.

**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I‚Äôve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I‚Äôm talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don‚Äôt buy precious metals, because they‚Äôre not based off anything anymore. And they‚Äôre heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It‚Äôs currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.

I personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it‚Äôll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Although, congress has to decide on the debt ceiling situation by July, and if the raising is rejected, that‚Äôll cause the pop. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you‚Äôve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.

In short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it‚Äôs harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don‚Äôt inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren‚Äôt included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.

Hopefully this helps y‚Äôall. There‚Äôs money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can‚Äôt find it, keep looking. If there‚Äôs an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.

AMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.

**TLDR;**

YCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)

YCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities (CPER, PDBC, GSG)

YCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)

YCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)

If you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we‚Äôll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it‚Äôll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.

One ^more thing^:

There is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.

If I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*

**EDIT (because y‚Äôall keep messaging me and commenting about one of them going down or wanting to yolo into one) -**

**My positions for this week: **

$135 3/19 TLT Puts

$65 3/19 ITB Puts

$95 3/19 VNQ Calls

**TLT and ITB are betting that FOMC causes a spike in yields.**

**VNQ is my hedge if I‚Äôm wrong and yields fall.**

If yields spike, good, I make a lot of money. If yields fall, good, I still make enough to cover the expenses of the others expiring worthless, while still making profits. Stop messaging me laughing that one of the three are down, I know at least one will go down, that‚Äôs the whole fucking point of hedging.

*And no, those 3 positions aren‚Äôt my entire account. Even though I diversified, it‚Äôs only about a tenth of my portfolio. It‚Äôs very important to have the humility to admit to yourself that no matter how much time and effort you put into research, there‚Äôs still a possibility you could be wrong. There‚Äôs no such thing as a sure thing. If you think something is a for sure thing, it‚Äôs almost a for sure thing that you‚Äôre wrong. I‚Äôve been burned too many times over the past years to risk a big portion of my portfolio on weeklys. I still manage my risks, no matter how big the potential reward is, and how little the potential risk may seem.*

Diversifying and hedging are still very important. I know y‚Äôall think diversifying is boomer shit, but when it comes to options it‚Äôs important. If you want to yolo into one, at least do long strangles. If your erection is pointing towards a certain direction, at least do a 2:1 ratio for strangles (having a ratio of 2 calls for every put for bullish, or having 2 puts for every call for bearish). Focus on preserving what you have. An almost certain 50% profit a week is way more lucrative over time than a low chance of 300%+ profit on a yolo. Understand greeks and what they mean. 

**Understand that stocks don‚Äôt move because of good news or bad news, they move because institutions want them to move aka low gamma (or not move if they sold strangles aka high gamma [keeps price action sideways rather than up or down]). They gamma hedge and delta hedge. They can literally rig the game by buying calls, selling puts, and then using billions to push the stock upwards, making profits off the puts they sold expiring worthless, making money off the calls they bought because they expire deep ITM, and profiting off the underlying stock they bought because of impulse waves and gamma squeezes from the people who sold them those calls.** 

**Don‚Äôt complain about how the game is rigged, think like an institution and figure out how to profit off of it. If you want to preach to your politicians to fix it and change laws and make it fair, you will be wasting your time and energy and will end up broke and depressed. Leave that to the social justice warriors. Look back over the past decade. Social media is flooded with them. All that time and energy and not a single thing has changed. I know because I‚Äôve been there when it comes to complaining the game is rigged. It took years for it to finally click for me. And now I‚Äôm making money.**

Understand that and IV and set yourself up for success. If you use TDA‚Äôs ThinkOrSwim, you can use option screeners to find options that are near the money with phenomenal gamma and IV levels. Pair that with research on current events and macroeconomics to figure out which stock options are the correct puzzle piece for the puzzle you‚Äôre solving. 

Boomers diversify by buying stocks in all areas. Which is dumb. Because when one market goes up, another probably takes a hit. Those profits are very slow. This is very different. We‚Äôre intensely focused on two areas, which are yields and debt. This week has a massive impact on those two areas, primarily the yields. We expect big movement either upwards or downwards in yields, that‚Äôs why playing both sides works. Because even on the hedge, the movement that direction will be big enough to cover expenses and still come out with profit.

I‚Äôve been on WSB for years. This account has only been posting here for about a year and a half, but I had another Reddit i deleted when I was in the market for a new job. I know some of the OGs here will roast you for not taking the route of high risk high reward. It‚Äôs the culture that‚Äôs been here, and will always be here. Loss porn is funny, and gain porn makes you aroused. But both of those types of posts have a very important meaning behind it, and that‚Äôs to keep your feet on the ground, but your eyes to the stars. 

Per the words of Billy Joel on Vienna, 

‚ÄúDream big, but don‚Äôt imagine they all come true. When will you realize, Vienna waits for you.‚Äù 

That song has made huge impacts on almost every aspect of my life, especially investing.

For every person I see on here who have changed their entire life with the gains they‚Äôve made, I‚Äôve watched the same amount of people lose more than they could afford. I‚Äôve watched newbies get burned bad and promise to themselves that they‚Äôll never touch stocks again, and they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve watched newbies get burned so bad and become depressed, and their posts signal a call for help. I lost four close friends to suicide my final year of college in 2018. I don‚Äôt want that to happen to any of you. I want you to shrink the ranges of the highs and lows. Just like taking too much of a certain substance, those high highs feel very good, but when the very low lows come around, you realize the highs weren‚Äôt worth the lows in the end. And more importantly, I want you to be able to continue investing throughout your life. Though, the dynamics and culture has changed quite a bit since 9m people joined, I welcome all of you to the group. Even if I miss what this subreddit used to be, I‚Äôm excited and optimistic about the future of WSB. If you‚Äôre eager to help this subreddit in any way possible, educate yourself on the market, the past/present/future global events and news, and do your own research that expands beyond the horizon of GME and AMC. Keep the shilling to a minimum, and back up all your posts with evidence. We‚Äôve all been in group projects before. We know that it sucks when only one person does all the work, while the others run around like idiots. Strive to make this subreddit an effective group project, where everybody helps pull their own weight. And also, keep posting those dank memes and drinking your own piss. Group projects are worth it when the group gets fucked up together after the work is all finished.

Good luck on your journeys, my messages are always open for advice. Don‚Äôt come in asking where you should throw your money into, I won‚Äôt respond. But if you ask questions on what to study, and my thoughts on certain trade ideas, or if you need someone to talk to, I‚Äôll respond. 

UPDATE: ITB puts are printing due to the NAHB confirming that home builders took a hit from yields rising (increasing mortgage rates) as well lumber inflation, which was my prediction

**RECOUNT NON-SENSE:**

AMC published (on March 5, 2021) a Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholder to be held on May 4 2021

This meeting is held to approve the increase the total number of shares of Class A common stock by 500,000,000 to a total of 1,024,173,073 - among other things. They are not issuing 500M new shares on that day, just asking for the right to - all at once or little by little.

They set the date of March 11, 2021 as the ‚Äòregister by date‚Äô to be allowed to vote in that meeting: ‚ÄúOur Board has fixed the close of business on March 11, 2021 as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting‚Äù

There is no recount. They know exactly how many shares are outstanding. They are not trying to count shares. They are just doing the routine call to register for the right to vote. As not every shareholder wants to vote, they asked to created proxys/quorums to vote en masse. Standard procedure.

Last year, AMC published the same notice, asking for the same registration, as is absolutely normal and standard: [*http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e2e535fa-d203-4b99-b206-05f2009217c9.pdf*](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e2e535fa-d203-4b99-b206-05f2009217c9.pdf)

**\*\* OPINION  \*\***

Now, I am bullish on AMC not because of crazy conspiracy theories. but based on trends:

**1:** People won't want to stream new movies, they will want to go to the movies, make an event out of it, hang out with friends. Streaming, we've done enough of it in 2020. I think Box office will go way up from 2019 levels, once 70%+ of the US population has been vaccinated (Fall 2021). But even for Memorial Day Weekend and July 4th Weekend - we should see some super high attendance numbers.

Movie going is a cheap, easy, everyone can go type activity - when compared to other things people have been missing - like travel.. going to the movies, is doable by almost everyone

**2:** AMC renegotiated movie ticket fees they pay to the studios. In the earnings call, AMC CEO said that if you're seeing Warner bros movies in their theaters, it's because they came to an agreement.. Rumors on the street is that they used to pay 55% in fees back to the studio, now they could be at 38%. Numbers aren't published, so they are not fact. But they did lower their cost.  


AMC CEO on Earnings Call: ""We put out a very clear statement that we were not willing to let Warner Bros. advantage its streaming service at AMC shareholders' expense.  And you may have noticed that we are playing Warner Bros. movies right now. Now we never discuss our film terms publicly, and I won't break that pattern today. But you should properly assume that if we're playing Warner movies, we came to agreement with Warner that any changes in their strategy are being done in ways where AMC shareholders benefit as opposed to or being penalized.""

So if attendance goes up from 2019 levels, and AMC gets to keep more per ticket sold, that means they could bring in more NET revenue than in 2019 - not even talking 2020.

**3:** Add the stimulus, markets going green, covid going down, vaccines going up.. it's looking good for AMC in the mid-term.

That's my 2 c

\*\* **OPINION \*\***

It‚Äôs easy for shorters to go buy these 51M shares out of 268M. We would have to be holding 250M+ shares to be able to create a squeeze. That‚Äôs a huge number‚Ä¶ We‚Äôd have to be like 2M people, holding 125 shares each (1,000$ at 8$ average)‚Ä¶ If people throw their Stimulus into AMC? Yeah totally can make it happen.. would they? and then would they Hold when it goes to 50$...100$.. ? gains are hard not to cash out when you actually see the number at your fingertips

But a raise in the stock price when they do buy back these 51 M shares will happen, it‚Äôs still 1/9 of the outstanding share count.. that‚Äôs pretty big, so yes, a bump short term, dip, go back up and then dilution in like September 2021 to crash it all the way down

""I hope this is considered worthwhile to not ban me; please be kind WSB mods. I think this is a good talking point. ""

Buying the dip to average down when affordable is definitely the way, but there are circumstances where some movement in the opposite direction in regards to average price is not overly detrimental

Someone was talking about having learned the way of averaging down today in the discussion thread. I'm actually doing the opposite unfortunately with my GME. I bought in on the back side of the 2nd ""crash"" at a few times for an average **$75.55 a share** for 9 shares.

\-------------------------

I've been buying fractionally when sensible and I'm sitting on 9.39 Shares now. in the process though my average has gone to $**85.8546 a share** ( a $6.01 change over 0.4 shares of fractional pickups. (These pickups have been the daily dips)

&#x200B;

Averaging down when you are strongly out of the money is in my opinion one of the most important aspects in the WSB ""strategy"" of buying dips , holding long, and locking in the lowest average possible.

GME and this short situation makes this one of those situations w*here every share and every bit of a fractional share are going to skyrocket,* so in this case quantity at a reasonable risk and entry point **is my priority.**

I'm adding a snip from my fidelity - there's AMC and AAL below that & 1 share of GME on Robinhood back when it was 80 bucks. ( i know i know) Robinhood is bad, no doubt, BUT The wife is handling robin hood. Its  smaller stakes but she is doing a good job & to me rationalizes still using the platform until i can get her to fidelity

That's why the fidelity account became our trading platform for main investments, Robinhood for light (math based - non-centralized) ( to avoid the C word) investment and more long term holdings.  Also we have 500ish working in stash just as a long term holding.

Thank you to everyone in the WSB community for your information, analysis and conversation.

As a matter of disclosure {ill honestly sell 2 shares when the second fractal tops out around 1200 to recoup my investment (actually covers across all my trading platforms)} & THE REST IS FUEL FOR THE ROCKET TO MARS.

&#x200B;

I am diamond hand to the moon, but I want the wife to have a confident feeling out of investing with proper Due Diligence, and seeing real returns. I hope to have fractional bought 2.0 more full shares in the mean time so I don't have to touch my main shares.

TLDR: So to summarize while it is usually optimal to try to get your average cost per share down, sometimes a rise in that number is inevitable if you got in early enough. Don't be afraid of a reasonable change in your price per share if quantity is your main asperation

Avg per share was 75.55 for 9 ( buying fractionally it has increased to 81.56 for the gain of .39 shares)

AMC and GME biggest tickers on sub, GME with a lot more attention. Then everyone sees AMC blowing up whilst GME is losing gains and they then want to transfer over. I myself is a strong ape and lit a zoot to the dip to try and get it high again. But I do think this could be a tactic to take our gains from GME as well as have more shares to short if people paper hand.

3/16/21 11:16,"$AMC March 15th Explained (And What's To Come) First off.....

GOOD JOB YOU FUCKING APES!

$14.04 close on the day and I see a new price target of $2008.01 for many like minded investors. I'll be subscribing to that school of thought myself. Before we continue!

This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Any price targets discussed are those of my own choosing and the decisions to continue to invest are entirely my own and I would not suggest you do anything farther than your own comfort allows.

We opened at $12.18 after closing at ($11.14 I believe?) On Friday....and then went on to a MONSTEROUS day today closing at $14.04! Awesome. But why?

1. News. 3:00 p.m Friday an article circulated of a short interview with the CEO of $AMC. It was a small glimmer for Apes to come but didn't come to fruition until AH (After Hours). The announcement was the hard line drawn in the sand by the CEO that the LA Market (Largest Market they have) would, 100%, open by this Friday.

2. Volume. 287 million in Volume today. About 200 million Friday. (Probably more, I don't remember). For reference...$GME was only at 24 million....yep. People see where the short is now. Volume will always drive buying activity, even if just for scalping, which always leads to Options, which leads to Gamma (more later).

3. ""Unusual Options activity"". This notice goes out when mad volume of Options are going out. In this particular case....Puts. about 5800 of them for a $9 price target. That's right, more money going AGAINST $AMC. What did you Apes do? That's right. YOU BOUGHT MORE!!!! Not only did this not hurt us, it simply showcased how the stock is being shorted...as if we needed more of that. But the more the merrier.

4. Gamma Build Up (Calls expiring ITM). No, we are not yet In a Gamma Squeeze. This has all been organic growth, which is far better in the long term. HOWEVER. 2 Weeks ago we landed the much needed $8.01. This lead to calls expiring ITM. (This doesn't always guarantee bought shares, more later)

-The Following week we close at $11. Once again...more ITM option calls, which leads to today. Pre-Market took us above $12 putting more calls ITM, which lead to $13 quickly doing the same. And the we found a new support base around $14. This is all chasing the $15 Option Mark where we have TONS of support waiting. 

5. The Witching Hour. Quadruple Witching on the EXACT SAME DAY $AMC Launches it's largest Market. Very frightening for Short positions that have been consistently losing millions.

Options Explained, FAQ
 Because there is A LOT of confusion on this.

- Do Options expiring ITM guarantee bought shares? Not necessarily. 

-Why? Because when your Option goes ITM and you ""Sell-To-Close"" you are selling the option contract back to the Exchange, not another human being.

-If the Exchange is buying it, don't they still need to buy Shares? Kinda. If they already have the shares, which they do, most of the time, then no, but they have to constantly purchase and sell shares through the exchange so as the Gamma builds up and raises the prices then the exchanges are paying more money for the shares which nets the outcome we are all looking for, which is BOUGHT SHARES. The more Options expiring ITM, also inspires massive Buying activity (always) whoch results in more people buy Shares (including other hedgies and whales who also want the price to go up) which leads to a constant feed back loop.

TL;DR: Options drive Buying Power and help raise the stock price even though they do not directly influence share price when bought or sold. $AMC has big things coming. Buy & Hold, Rinse & Repeat!

3. Apes go in all directions.  The majority of which will be GME and AMC.  Other places will see upticks.  Share prices rise and that carries through Friday.  At which point Friday is the last safe day for shorts to get out without facing a ""sudden death"" cover your shit or else call under the new rules.

Lesson of the day: üéì
What is the utilization rate and what is AMC‚Äôs rate? What does it mean for AMC ?üé•üçø

So Amc is currently at 84.62% according to Ortex.

In Smart Ape language : it‚Äôs number of shares borrowed by hedgies/short sellers/market makers divided by total lendable shares by other institutional lenders/hedgies. 
‚Äî‚Äî-
In Smooth Ape Language (the fun begins): 

* Gorillas ü¶ç = We the average retailers

* Snakes üêç = Hedgies 

* Lions ü¶Å = Institutional Lenders that run the kingdom

*** STORY TIME***

The snakes üêç wanna take away the bananas from the gorillas and double, triple, 10x their own banana count.

But the snake üêç currently doesn‚Äôt have enough bananas in his own possession to make the strategic moves he and other snakes thought of, so he needs to borrow from someone he KNOWS has some. None other than the kingdom rulers themselves. The lions ü¶Å.

So the lion ü¶Å says: I‚Äôve got 100M bananas üçå total in my name that I‚Äôm willing to allow you to borrow. And I gave up 84.62% of them. So if you want the rest or some of my bananas, my interest has gone up because I have less availability. Might have more soon, might have less. Idk. But you snakes have been bombarding me for bananas the last 2 months. 

Snake üêç says ‚Äúscrew it, üò§ I‚Äôll take them because my pride is too great and the gorillas are holding on to their bananas like diamond hands and its become harder to hoard them myself because they have been growing their bananas in the backyard each day. Ughhh, I even bet with other cobras and gorillas that their bananas production will go down. And its doing the opposite!!! üêçüò¨ So I need to show them who‚Äôs boss!‚Äù 

Lion ü¶Å says:‚Äùgo for it! Here take another 15M  but i want them back.‚Äù üí∏üí∞

**SO WHAT DO THE GORILLAS DO TO BE AHEAD OF THEM?‚úä**

Gorilla ü¶ç says to Gorilla Kingdom: ‚Äúhaha, look at these 1000 smart snakes trying to out think 10 million smooth apes...i may eat crayons when im alone but when it‚Äôs me and the boys/girls we eat snakes.....! Alright boys ü¶çand gorilla galsü¶ß, if you see other apes selling for low price. Buy!!! If not, do Nothing else but keep holding the bananas and continue to grow them in the backyard. Eventually their time will run out, there won‚Äôt be enough bananas to be passed around amongst snakes üêç And they‚Äôll have lost on other tactics (options) and be forced to buy up all the bananas they promised to give back and never did because they sold them all to us. But we like our bananas ripe. And we don‚Äôt wanna give them back. Well, not unless they pay me $2008.01 per banana. So... yeah‚Äù

Fin. Thanks for reading!

3/17/21 03:21,"AMC Apedate (Update) Welcome back Apes.

(upvote, comment so everyone sees Apedate!)
We have seen some rising volatility the last days, which we love. But there is one very interesting fact. 

**Fact 1:** Last Friday the GME &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; AMC stocks formed a new dip, which all of us apes bought instantly. Do you remember the time the shittingers started dipping and halting the stocks? No ... WELL I DO! It was excactly 12:20 when the shitters shitstorm started shitting.


**Fact 2:** Yesterday was the same thing going on. Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that ‚ù§Ô∏è. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20!

**Conclusion**: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter‚Äôs market manipulation.

SSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$. Anyway let‚Äôs start with the premarket update

**Pre market Update 09:02**: Germany is proudly hodling the support line which has formed the last few days between 13.10$-13.40$. We shall aid them in 28 Minutes when the stock exhange officialy opens. 

Stocks available to short: 650.000
Current Stock Price: 13.46$

**Update 09:31:** Stock opens with 13.45$ and instanlt plumets down to 13.3$. We will have to fight at the support Line until we get some buying power rolling.

Stocks available to short: 650.000 (unchanged)
Current Price: 13.35$

Stocks available to short dropped from 1,100,000 to 650.000 which explains the dip. Buy the dip apes!

**Update 10:02:** Them Shitters used around 50.000 short stocks, that‚Äôs why we see our resistance getting tested all the time. We should be up abd running in the next 1-2 Hours. 14$ isn‚Äôt far away until than.

**Update 10:10:** We touched 12.50$ and jumped right back to our support at 13$,
I‚Äôm sure we have quite few diamond hands holding there, good job. Anyway we had some massive volume at starting 30 Minutes, around 1 Million! The way back to 14$ shouldn‚Äôt be too hard with all those stimulus checks incoming, I guess! Buy the FKN DIP until it ain‚Äôt too late! 

Current Price: 13$
Shares available to borrow: 750.000

**Update 11:03:** The dip stopped dipping. Last chance to buy some stonks. No seriously, we shall see some upward movement from here (12.74$). AMC is very likely gonna follow GME (which madd +10% in like 10 Minutes üöÄ). 
Anyway there is also bad news which actually is good news: The shitters have topped up their ‚Äúborrowable-shares‚Äù it‚Äôs sitting right now at 4.600.000 !!!! ... They could short the fuck out of us now and i would Love if that happens, because than .... THAN THEY WILL LOSE EVEN MORE MONEY once the üöÄ starts off to the üåö 

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current stock price: 12.94$

**Update 11:12:** Im gonna predict something. Today at exactly some seconds before 12:20, we will see a massive Stonk Sell-Off from the Shitters, they will try and implement fear into us, but they won‚Äôt succeed.

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current price: 13.13$ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;‚Äî is the stock price trying to tell us something? ... 13k13 which means 13.130!!!

**Update 12:03**
1.5 Million NEW shorts available which means there are now 6.100.000 Shorts available to the HFuckers. Wow, that‚Äôs gonna be a bloodbath in some days, be ready for Impact any day and show them what diamond hands are made from. 
Our support line moves diagonally down which means, it is not anymore at 13, but moved rather down to 12.4-12.6$. As long as we dont lose that 
Support today we should see some upward movement ... if HFuckers dont manipulate the market at 12:20 like yesterday.

Currently available shorts: 6.100.000 ... seriously.
Current Price: 12.69 (well ... at this point you should tell your wifes boyfriend that amc said its 69 time)

**Update 12:08**
The short borrowing Fee has massively decreased. It was 3 working days ago at 8%, now it is sitting at 1.8%. This is only embracing the fact that they are scared from our diamond hands and are preparing the next market manipulation.

**Update 12:20**
HedgieFuzzers have decided to not launch they‚Äôre massive attack Today. They are probably stocking their positions up. But i‚Äôm sure we will see the attack in the next days (Before we can see again daily profits of 30-50%)

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.50$

**Update 12:21**
What is interesting here is, is the stock dynamic which upped the AMC price from 12.5$ up to 12.75 in under 2 Minutes.

Shorts available: 6.100.000 ... Fee changed from 1.8% to 1.7%
Current Price: 12.75

**Update 13:01**
AMC is slowly refuelling it‚Äôs motors and starting to scratch at 12.83 resistance. If we get rejected from this resistance , than an double top scenario could occur, which would push the price as low as to 12.50 (where also our support is). Time will tell.
Besides that not much has happened.

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.8$

**Update 13:05**
It seems that we will break the 12.83$ resistance. Keep up diamond habds and buy the dip!
We also have an inversed head &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; shoulders to assist us in the push to 13$. 

**Update 13:55**
We have barricaded ourselves at 13$ and aren‚Äôt planning on giving that mark away to the hedgies! 
The next mark is around 13.6-14$. 
Anyway i have discovered something very mysterious. The available short stocks has decreased by 100.000. From 6.1mil to 6.0mil. Apes, all of you know what that means ... \*apes nodding their head\*
... and if not ill tell you ... \*apes breathe eases\*.
This means the HedgeFuckers are preparing to decrease the stock price again, with my prediction being an mix between closing long positions and short attacking (SSR is enabled so this won‚Äôt be very successfull, unless they manipulate the market again.). We should see attacks dropping the amc stock, when it starts scratching 14.10$.

Shorts available currently: 6.000.000
Price Currently: 13.15

**Update 14:18**
Still very quiet. Amc is preparing for the fight with resistance at 13.5-13.6$, once we break it we shall have a smooth ride to 14$.

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Current Price: 13.3$

**Update 14:30** 
Shitters are making their moves again. See how the stock dropped 0.40$ unnormaly while being in an natural up movement supported by double buttom + inversed head ans shoulders and some ü¶ç Ape checks (stimulus). We should drop im the next minutes to 12.8$-12.9$ before our rocket refules for taking on the 14$ mark. 

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Price: 13.02$

**Update: 14:52**
Apparently we have failed the double bottom + inversed head and shoulders climb. But domething even better is coming up: rising wedge and the 5th leg are those 12.8$ where we are hovering right now. The 6th leg could catapult us to 14$! 

Current Price: hovering at 12.8$ and building up 5th leg

**Update 14:57**
Quick uodate on shorts available. The shitteres decreased available shorts by 200.000! Watch out for some massive barrier at 14$ or maybe even at 13.4$
Did they allready use those 200.000 shorts? Probably not, but they reserved them so to say.

Yeah, I have a newer account, fuck off about it.
This was done at 11Am, March 16th.

TLDR: AMC is showing signs of a reversal right out of open/premarket. Almost all MACD time charts support this, and so does RSI. 

GME is set for a red day. Yeah I know, I expected to be in a better spot, but unfortunately I'd expect more of a sell off most of tomorrow, we are seeing constant manipulation of Hedges painting the tape on stocks, bouncing sales back and forth at a volume of 60,61,62, shares etc. Whatever it is, go look at the order book most days, its completely obvious. We SHOULD have finally gotten  into an uptrend on March 16, but because of this we didn't. Unfortunately the MACD is poised for us to have another possibly bad run all of tomorrow and possible untill Friday. 

My opinion: I expect an abnormality to occur at some point. This isn't normal trading, we SHOULDN'T  be trading sideways like this, it isn't healthy or natural. I think similar to ENDGAME Dd, we will see a completely unpredictable abnormality between March 17th and 19. 

What we need to do: LOOK AT THE FUCKING MACD
LOOK AT THE FUCKING ORDER BOOK. 
You fucking apes want this shit to happen? Stop watching guys on YouTube not even displaying the information that matters, you NEED to learn how, and when to act on this reversal or your just going to fuck everyone.

3/17/21 10:28,"Give me a chance please TLDR; why all of the hate between AMC/GME? It's not us vs them. It's the average Joe vs the rich

I know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of GME that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. 

AMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. 

Hating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single ""retail investor"" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win/squeeze, the entire economy/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

 Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. 

To me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. 

So support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME.

So now the fun part:

We have heard a lot about Elliott-Waves over last few days and I just realized, that the AMC chart is acting in exact the way as described by Elliott. We have three impulsive waves, first is shortest, seconds is the most explosive one and third one should be pretty much the same as first one.

So if you look at the chart: [AMC 1h on Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nJRPn7cv/) you will see that I have added the second correction and the third wave pretty much in the size of those before. Prediction goes to \~16.50 USD this friday. I think this is a pretty realistic prediction as it can also be traded as a swing trade with EMA50.

I have no idea what will happen after we reach my target but if you ask me, I would say that there's a good chance that we will see further breakouts upward.

TL;DR: There's a pretty good chance that we will hit at least \~16.50 USD by Friday.

Brokers feed data into S3 so that they can figure out what borrow rate to charge for lending shares out. This helps 'validate' that the 'ability to borrow' is related to the 'borrow fee'. We can use this information as a barometer to guess/indicate how many shorts are covering as a net position AND we can see the affect on price.

**$AMC has significant short covering! More to come!**

We see this starting as of March 10th and this drove up demand volumes on price. Remember the price only goes up if there are more buyers than sellers. By keeping an eye on short covering you can, to some extent, predict how much intrinsic buying demand there is in a stock. There are many unknowns however including how many other sellers may be taking profits, closing positions OR new buyers entering.

[$AMC, BLUE IS SHORT COVERING - Price goes UP](https://preview.redd.it/8cxvnms99mn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b117cb869ad073ba1fdb3cc922b70461959c46d3)

**$GME not THAT much short covering! A lot more potential here!**  
You can quickly compare AMC to GME and see that shorts are not covering in the same way and in the last couple days the price has actually been falling. What this tells me is other holders are simply selling, maybe people are worried, but the shorts are not driving up the price.... yet! This bodes well for HODL!

[$GME, BLUE IS SHORT COVERING](https://preview.redd.it/fohleedr9mn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=008c2d653462aa98f9c4ae3f4d897595a196df77)

&#x200B;

**$RKT covering only started TODAY!**

RKT has been trading sideways and consolidating. I've covered this stock in some other DD and it looks ready to go up. There are still some paper-hands that are selling but as of today we're seeing the shorts panic with the latest optimistic housing data. They realize this isn't going lower and want to get out NOW before they get crushed.... I see a BIG OPPORTUNITY....

**TLDR:**  
**$AMC: This week a lot of short covering driving price UP. More to come! Looks good.**  
**$GME: Only a little bit of covering, relatively, so there are a lot of shorts that are not covering and likely do not feel like they need to yet! HODL**  
**$RKT: Short covering started only today! Prepare for takeoff!**  
**$BB: It's a battle right now and unclear who is winning just yet!**  
**$NOK: Absolutely NOTHING happening**

We can use short covering to make informed expectations about future price movements!  


**EDIT: 4PM Aftermarket**  
Jowell and Fed Reserve today told us they will continue to support the economy, inflation is UNDER CONTROL, bonds chilled out. Recovery looks promising and we're on the right track. Markets re-bounded strong!  


**GME is COMPLETELY PRICE PINNED at $209! Trading sideways. These guys have it under complete control!**  


$BB closed up 1.22% and is flaky after-market  


$AMC closed 3.84% and is rising 3% after market! Go AMC!  


$NOK closed .9% and is up a bit after-market!  


$RKT is COMPLETELY CONTROLLED! They have this price pinned at EXACTLY $24.50. I've never seen anything like it. Complete manipulation.

3/19/21 07:19,"Take A Step Back- No I'm serious Hello Ape, there has been a lot of information on both sides of GME today and this week.

**So in my opinion, I feel like it‚Äôs healthy to shed statistics and look at reasonable assumptions. Take this how you will, hopefully for the best. üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

1. **Take a step back and look at the one-month chart compared to the three-month chart.** I don‚Äôt know why this is not getting as much talk as I believe it should. GameStop, and AMC, are trading in a healthy pattern that mirrors an actual stock. Now I want you to think about that statement, **GameStop, the most notorious of the meme stocks, is trading in a healthy market reflective pattern! That is incredible, and I don‚Äôt know why no one is talking about it.**
2. **On the same thread look how gradual our movements are in comparison to the last run-up. This time we have steady growth, IV, MacD support** and everyone is freaking out because it‚Äôs not making 25% jumps! T**hat‚Äôs crazy, we are moving and consolidating in an extraordinarily impressive way. Some days, we even beat the market! Last time we had no support, no smart money investors, and no market makers that would even touch us with a 30-foot pole because of poor signifiers. This time not only are we building up strong, but we have also already seen a healthy retraction and amazing consolidation around the $200 mark.**
3. I know this is over talked, but the **new CFO in my opinion brings a lot of value to the company.** I hope that he will follow through on his promises and we will see a new chapter in GameStop!
4. **Literally, the market has been crapping his pants the past few days. Now that we see game stop following a relatively healthy trading pattern, why would you expect it to explode?** I understand Guillermo and covering, take a deep breath all of this happened so quickly, I don‚Äôt think the majority of look at the bigger picture!

**TL:DR-**

**Take a step back and look at all of the positives that GameStop has brought on us! If you like this stock then hold or buy more, and if you don‚Äôt I‚Äôll see you from the moon!üöÄüöÄüöÄü¶ßü¶ßü¶ß**",42321,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.991609275,True

so it means stock has local and global uptrend after pandemic loses.   
3. day before yesterday we reached for me key level that was 11.90$ (the high before pademic starts and cant be reached while strong time of period)with natural uptrend and i think that this 11.90$ level is strong support line   
4. if you think that it is to late to go in position you are very wrong look at whole picture  [Amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)doing well after pandemic stock can't be downed by very strong short sell pressure    
5.for me target for this and next week target is near 26-28$ per share ( don't forget that stimuls that get most of Americans are going on stock markets and if you will make deep researches you will get more info that americans support  [amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)and there is idea that near min 10-12% of those stimuls will go in  [Amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)and so called penny stocks but reason why i trust in  [AMC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)is that it is not penny stock    
6.stock is going up and up every time and we really get chance to finally got short and gamma squeezed but forget about squeezes this is only chance nothing more.   


7. and finally decision stock is doing well stock is recovering after pandemic we are slowly reaching new key levels so  [amc ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/)really have potential to grow natural like 70-90% up by end of the may or june so if we support this idea that will really increases our chances to get short and gamma squeezed it mean min(400-500% rise) but this is only theoretic idea to make it happend we just don't stop buying and holding this stock  [cuz ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CUZ/)it is profitable without gamma or short squeezes but idea that we can get to Squeezes it is so exciting    


so make always your own analysis and trade after it is your own risk to go in position i only sharing you what is my ideas    
i open first long position at 6.28$ and after that i'm buying and buying more when HF are making short sell pressure this give me chance to get some more positions at the dip

Yes, he has stories. Yes, he USE to be a broker, and Yes he's got some decent info about GME.

&#x200B;

He also runs a memebr only Youtube site that makes you pay to make a comment on his page. He only reads super chats, and has NO insight or desire to look at any other stocks his members ask of him. He glances over anything that isn't GME, a complement about him, or just tries to sell him merch.

He's been asked about RKT, he didnt know about it. He was asked about CCIV..never heard of them. He was asked about AMC, and he bashes it, using his own opinion without any Technical Analysis to back it up. He doesnt do any DD, even when it comes to GME. He has nothing but guesses about where GME might go in the future. Can GME get into game streaming? Maybe. Wonder is he's heard about Steam, Stadia, Xbox Pass or PSN? Will GME get into eSports? Wonder if he knows about MTG?  

This guy is nothing but a one trick Pony. Once the GME bubble pops, he's gonna disappear, unless cruises start back up, which they wont for a while. And even then, he's always talking about how he sets up groups to go on cruises with him but only so he and his wife can get a free room. 

Does he know his Poop about GME?  Yes he does. If you're in GME and only GME, watch him. 

Lets be honest, if you're only in GME, then fuck me, why are you investing?

You're better suited to watch Treys Trades, AndrewMoMoney, StockMoe, Max Maher, Matt Kohrs..and really a handful of any other youtubers. Most of these guys are transparent about who they've invested in. 

Not only do  they all look at other stocks, they actually answer their viewers questions, and they educated you.

Bruce (not calling him uncle, cause uncles are suppose to be helpful, like Uncle Ryan) just reads super chats, and tries to sell his personal advice for $400 an hour. How can someone who no longer invests give advice? How can someone that hasn't heard about CCIV, RKT, HCMC, and whatever is at least being talked about all over the place advise people with their money?  Would you go to GME for advise about real estate?

I'm sure I'll get some flack for bad mouthing Bruce, and I'm sure he'll have some sort of excuse or reasons for all this, and I'd say some of  this in his channel but I'm not joining his group and give him money to just glance over Super chats.

 [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) and [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) have been at incredibly dire circumstances this past two weeks. After building up so much momentum, Hedges have pulled the rug from under their feet. [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click) in particular has been the focus of attacks, though the impact has also reflected equally on [\#AMC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AMC?src=hashtag_click).  Let‚Äôs take a step back, and reflect again on how Hedges have indirectly attacked [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click)(and other meme stocks like [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click)) indirectly through ETFS. Take a look at the charts here that demonstrate the price action similarity between ETF‚Äôs & [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click).  


[SPDR](https://preview.redd.it/dvvhzc7055p61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b08fa40a52a9b652f00ba1acd4d523c65c3c897)

Today, thanks to big communities like WSB and many others, we have further proof that Hedges are becoming increasingly desperate to take down [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) to the point where they have pretty much shorted the entire **Russell 2000** in order to force the [\#stock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stock?src=hashtag_click) value of [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click) down.

You may be asking, what does Russell 2000 ETFs have to do with [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click), right? How are they related? #GME became biggest company in the Russell 2000 Index. Look at t he images for confirmation of evidence/proof.

Why in God's name did Hedges attack the ENTIRE Russell 2000? Well, let's look back(look at the image here, & keep in min this applied to both [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) and [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click), but the real target has always been [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click)). Naked shorting first dropped the price, but...

not enough people sold. Then it blew up through a squeeze and more people gained confidence this wasn't going down no matter what. 

Then they attempted attacking ETFs, which are funds that are made up of [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) & [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) shares, but people didn't sell. Now, they are attacking the entire Russell 2000 ETFs since initially ETFs with big [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) holdings didn't work. 

This is a scorched earth policy for them. It's no longer about simply [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click), its about attacking everything they can to make EVERYONE dump everything, in hopes it has an effect on [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) & [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click). I cannot overstate this enough, they are literally attacking Indexes now. They are spreading themselves so much through these attacks I no longer believe in their shorting strategy. 

It simply won't work, so the question stops being **how long** until they cover, and becomes... **how in the hell do they even cover**, when they won't even be close to having money? The way I understand, it goes first by the funds who shorted, then the notorious Market Makers. They will be force to liquidate all assets they have to pay for the shares back that they  borrowed.

I also suspect a big government investigation when this blows up, and tons of bailout petitions on the Senate.  Nobody is selling [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click), and same goes for [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) for the most part. [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click) community is the strongest out there. Here's proof to this.

# Why does this matter?

Because it implies that this price decrease is literally all an elaborate scheme. Its a lie, a Fugazi as Matthew McConaughey said. Remember, a pullback was always going to happen. All you have to worry about is not selling. Days are going to get harder and redder from here on out. 

The whole market is also suffering from high bond yields. [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) and [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) are also victims of poor circumstances of the current mood of the [\#stock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stock?src=hashtag_click) market. Even with days like today, where [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) had no volume and lost over 20% of its value, you cannot sell. [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) is in my opinion one of the safest [\#stocks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stocks?src=hashtag_click) out there for those **longing** it. 

If you are a **short term trader, do not** play it because you **will** lose your money. What is coming is a red wave that will shake everyone. [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click) can fall below **20** dollars again. 

# Where do we go from here?

Now we **wait**. Hedges are raising capital through these shortings by also grabbing positions on [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) and [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) and many other [\#stocks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stocks?src=hashtag_click). When they squeeze they too will get a sizable portion of the rip. These people are POS, not stupid. 

Expect market conditions, expect questionable tactics like naked shorting, index attacks, ETF manipulations, and OTC selling to continue. Expect to be vilified and mocked by the media, in particular CNBC. Your job is simple. ***HOLD***.

# Don't lose faith.

They will do everything they can to get your shares at a discount. Don't give it to them. You think they are pulling all these things for nothing? They are on the verge of collapse and honestly the only thing that will save them is shorting [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) to the point where they can actually buy some at the bottom and when [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) & [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click) and other [\#stock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stock?src=hashtag_click) explode, ride it to the top, get some earnings and possibly get a bailout by the government.

&#x200B;

I hope I was able to provide you with councel, advice, and a full understanding of the current predicament you are in. It took me a while to compile all this data for you and break it down in easily digestible chunks so that you understand what is going on with [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) in particular, but other [\#stocks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stocks?src=hashtag_click) like [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click).

The goal of this is to bring direction and awareness with correct information to the masses so that we aren't lost.

***TLDR***: Hedges are starting to attack Indexes and ETFs, as seen with the Russell 2000 Index. This may be their last resort, but it's not happening. Expect juicy discounts and prepare your wallets, as $GME might fall below with what some of you are comfortable with. Just don't get scared and HODL.

3/25/21 16:38,"The secret is out about the Dark Pool and OTC, what to do now with AMC and GME? As most of my fellow ü¶ç know by now, citadel and the hedgies have been shorting both GME and AMC through Dark Pools, almost 50% of the daily shorts. Majority of the transactions is hidden from the public and retail investors do not have access to this. Now the question is what do we do?

1. BUY AND HOLD! We can no longer be scared, it is confirmed the hedgies are scared and are literally finding any method to short the stock. Whether it‚Äôs naked shorts, dark pool, ETFs, whatever method they could think of, they will do. So we have to show these crooks that we are NOT AFRAID! We have to fight back and increase the purchasing volume. So STOP BUYING OTM CALL OPTION, start buying more SHARES! 88% of AMC float is held by retail investors, that‚Äôs about 27 million shares remaining, we need to buy those up ASAP and hold! Same process with GameStop. But remember only buy what you can afford! And most importantly HOLD!

2. Spread the word! Not every ape has Reddit, so we need to spread the word. Whether that‚Äôs through Twitter, Webull, Facebook, discord, other social media outlets, whatever it is, we need to being more awareness. I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall, after discovering this Dark Pool business and how they continued to short on SSR, nothing can faze me now. We know all their tricks now, nothing is hidden. And if they do try something else, our autist apes will discover it. We have a lot of paper hands and people that are in between paper and diamond hands, I‚Äôll just call them crystal hands. A lot of them are not well informed and don‚Äôt understand the current situation. Our job as ü¶ç is to help them. Even if it‚Äôs just one person, that one person shares it with his friend, and that friend shares it to someone else. It is a chain reaction. SO WE NEED TO SPREAD THE WORD!

3. Report to the SEC. I know this is almost useless, but there has to be one person there that will listen. Use their website, Twitter, mailing address, phone number, whatever method it is, try. Also speak to your local and state officials. They might listen. Maybe even try to get AOCs attention (let‚Äôs not get political here, she is the top government official that‚Äôs active on social media). Even if she is ‚Äúdumb as rocks‚Äù, just bringing it to her attention could lead to an investigation or at worse more awareness.

4. Call the üê≥. Yes the whales. Look at the whales that own GameStop and AMC, and try to get their attention as to what is going on. They have better lawyers and a larger voice than most retail investors.

5. Try to get in contact with GameStop and AMC board members and explain to them what‚Äôs going on. Yes AMC has started a share count, but this could expedite the process. GameStop reported on the 10K that their shares are being shorted, let‚Äôs see if we can force them to recall the shares.

6. BUY AND HOLD! I‚Äôm stating this twice because this is most important step. Apes strong together, and we need each other more than ever before. We are going to be in a lot of battles with the share price, but apes have to hold strong. 

Remember what are we fighting for, remember who are we fighting, remember why apes are fighting the hedgies. This will be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. There will be movies, books and songs about us. Your kids will be thought about this squeeze in school. They will make new regulations to give retail investors a fighting chance to succeed. Plus all the tendies that come with it. ü¶ç can afford medical expenses, new homes, pay off debt, pay for school, finally get a chance to pursue their dream, setting our kids up for a better future, start a new life, help out the community, or simply just buy lambos. We all are fighting for a cause.

There‚Äôs not much we can do with the Dark Pool trading as they will continue to short the stock and drive the price down, but this will only make ü¶ç stronger. They don‚Äôt understand that the longer this process takes, the more paychecks we get, which means more buying opportunity. That‚Äôs why we keep holding.

***Guys in the game of Long HF (wrecking ball) vs Short HF (the brick wall) we're like Miley Cyrus... Swinging naked on the ball and along for the ride!***

The Longs are smart, they knew they wanted to play this sideways all week.  They know the Shorts are playing both sides of this game.  Shorts are buying all the Calls 250+, just in case they find themselves out of position even more than they already are.  Additionally, the Shorts doubled down and bought thousands of PUTs.  the magic number was 200.  We just put a clinic on them, the LONGs have us holding that support.  We're not selling and the Longs know that.  So, lets look at next week...  once these AMC peeps realize we've been the endgame all along they'll come back.  They chased 15 bucks and got burned.  With GME earnings report coming out Tuesday and ETFs adjusting next week. Apes will find direction and community support will follow.  We won guys, we won big.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: If you own the stock, you're winning.  If you need more ""dry powder"" to buy more GME. Go to Costco and refund anything you ever bought there.  They'll give you cash and boom... You can keep this fire burning!

Lastly, Stop getting nervous paper hands.  We're not dropping to 140 bucks any time soon... Ride these waves and enjoy the ride.

Dear Apes,
What you just witnessed with AMC at the last 2 minutes of the market close, was horrible. We get back at them by selling our shares at extreme prices for both GME and AMC, so the Hf and their traders looses everything, their Manhattan penthouse, their chauffeured Bentley, their Michelin star chefs and regret their whole lives thinking a bunch of apes, turned their whole lives upside down. 
That‚Äôs the price I want for 2008, for apes holding these stocks, their mental fatigue, all the sleepless nights, their kids, family, house, medical, students at schools. This is enough.
I do insist all the day traders and investors to make money through other stocks and dump in these stocks, take help from your fellow friends, apes help each other make money by holding and making each other get their desired prices. Us divided is what they are praying on, imagine us united will make those big boys piss their pants, they are 1% cause we have our money invested in their companies. Their ability to manipulate, cheat and bend the rules to their will, I say that‚Äôs enough. We have seen enough, I am humbled, but really pissed. Today a lot of my fellow apes have options OTM and who is responsible the HF, the powerful institutions and financial market caretakers are doing nothing about it. Who is suffering us, us retail investors and traders. 
Look out for each other, all our lives we have competed with one another making money out of each other, this is the one time we can make the money off the 1% I say we take it. Win or loose is upto god, but not trying will be on us. 
It‚Äôs not the end of your life even a day can change your life, be positive, relax and trust the path you have chosen for yourselves. 
I myself own 180@14 AMC and 80@230 GME shares, keeping some money to buy more, I am trying and hoping for the best.  
Hold and buy if possible don‚Äôt loose hope not now, not when things might go our way for once in life.

3/19/21 20:43,"Why AMC is a BUY - An Employee Perspective \*This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor\*

So to start this off, I used to be a manager for one of AMC's largest competitors, Cinemark (CNK). When covid happened, my stock portfolio took a major hit along with the market, but it wasn't as bad as it could've been. I started to look for the companies that got hit hard by the pandemic, but would bounce back stronger once the country opened back up. I immediately had movie theaters in mind for some sweet investment potential.

In the past year, CNK hit a low of $5.71 and AMC went down to $1.91 and I had to pick which horse to bet on. I opted to go all in on CNK because they were in a better financial situation, and maybe I was biased from having worked there, but it made the most sense to me until all of this came about.

As AMC climbed up to around $20 during that initial wave, my CNK went up by association, I sold, and then I turned my attention towards GME midway through the first climb and made a quick profit. Afterwards, I returned to my original movie theater plan, only this time, I was all in on AMC.

In my opinion, AMC now has the highest return potential out of all the movie theater chains, even without the short squeeze.

In early 2015 and late 2016/early 2017, both Cinemark and AMC had record breaking years. CNK stock was 1.9x higher at around $45 and AMC was 2.5x higher at around $35. Business was booming, but it wasn't really because the theaters were doing anything different, it was because the studios released A TON of record breaking movies during that time, which brought in massive revenue for theaters.

39 of the Top 50 highest grossing films were released in the last decade and 38 of those grossed over $1 billion in international box office revenue. With all the huge upcoming films, and the ones that got postponed from covid, and all the pent up demand to go to the movies, I am very confident that this trend will continue and that we'll see new record breaking films over the next few years and even the next decade.

Another concern that people were bringing up is that streaming services and VOD studio releases are going to kill movie theaters in the long run, and I think that this is completely wrong. As I just mentioned, 78% of the highest grossing films of all time came out in the last decade. While streaming services may have replaced brick and mortar video rental stores, they couldn't replace the experience of going to the movies and catching the latest film on the big screen and the increase in theater attendance over the last decade proves it.

During AMC's Q4 conference call, the CEO mentioned that over half of their customers were return customers and that they were able to track this through their AMC Stubs memberships and from my time working for their competition, I can confirm that this was the same case over at Cinemark. We had dedicated return customers that would see a movie \*at least\* once a week, seniors especially. Those seniors fucking loved a discount day and they also just liked to get out of the house.

With the country opening back up, restrictions lifted, vaccines expected to be available for all adults by May, and 98% of AMC theaters to be open by tomorrow, that brings back the regulars which made up over half their business and everything is looking green in the months to come.

I am 100% ALL IN on AMC and I have full confidence in the stock, but let's play devil's advocate:

Worst case scenario, the big squeeze doesn't happen (it will), the company struggles to pay off it's debt while accruing more debt and then they start to go under, in which case, they will more than likely get acquisitioned by another company. Amazon, Netflix, or maybe one of their competitors, and then the shareholders see a nice payday. This scenario would take the longest to play out, which is the only major downside.

Realistic Scenario, the big squeeze happens, \*possibly\* even breaking the quadruple digits, apes get tendies, the stock normalizes, and we have a party in the ruins of the hedgefunds that dared to bet against us.

Best cast scenario, the big squeeze is fucking ridiculous, we all get super rich and buy condos on the moon.

In any case, the only way to make money on AMC is to buy and hold.

3/26/21 08:06,"On The Dark Pool/OTC Trading Claims (AMC/GME) **INTRODUCTION**

I, being a fellow ape, have seen all of the posts referencing dark pool/OTC trading recently. I jumped down the rabbit hole of investigating this and what it actually means for a short squeeze and thought I would share what I found. In short, I do not think this is the hail Mary shot in the dark everybody thinks it is, but I will let you come to your own conclusions. I still believe AMC and GME will moon, I like the stock and I own a few k worth of shares myself.

DISCLAIMER: This is my first time doing a DD, so any suggestions are appreciated. Additionally, I am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice.

**SECTIONS:**

Background

Difference between OTC and Dark Pool

Why does this matter

What does the data mean

Analysis

Conclusion

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND:** There was a post recently with a screen shot showing FINRA reported, OTC non-ATS trading volume for GME. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcpce6/finra\_offers\_publicly\_available\_information\_on/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcpce6/finra_offers_publicly_available_information_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

It showed a very large volume of shares traded compared to float by Citadel, Virtu Americas, and G1 execution. People checked it for AMC and everybody thought the found the ghost we had all been searching for. 1billion traded by Citadel for AMC in the month of February. A link to the FINRA site to see this yourself is [HERE](https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/AtsIssueData).

&#x200B;

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DARK POOL AND OTC:**

OTC or over the counter trading is a way firms can trade directly between each other without it being done on the open market. This is how stocks that are not allowed on open exchanges such as NYSE as traded. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly in this context, this is how market makers and  brokerages can trade between EACH OTHER.

Dark Pool trading is very difference however. Dark pools, as according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp) are ""privately organized financial forum or exchange for trading securities"". This sounds scary, but to put it in ape language, it just means that it is a place where institutional investors such as blackrock or vanguard, talk directly to each other, and buy or sell directly to each other instead of putting the shares in the open market for us apes to buy. This is a way to prevent extreme volatility whenever institutional investors buy and sell, as well as gives the institutions better prices since there will not be people scalping or taking profits.

RECAP: OTC is between market makers and brokerages while Dark Pool is between 2 institutional investors.

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

First off, the FINRA data is specifically non-ATS(alternative trading system). Dark pool is considered an ATS, and therefore the FINRA data is 100% NOT dark pool. I have seen many youtubers that I enjoy watching conflating the two terms. I still appreciate them, and the service they do for the ape army, but there is a difference and it's easy to make stuff sound shady when you throw ""dark"" in the name.  I'm just trying to fight the mis-information and educate the ape army for this part. Finally, to the meat and potatoes.

&#x200B;

**WHAT DOES THE FINRA DATA MEAN?**

The first thing I wanted to know when I saw the data is what does it actually mean. All FINRA reports is ""shares"". So I printed off and read the FINRA [data website user guide](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/otc-transparency/ats-documentation) for this particular page. Here are the key take aways, there are 3 different listings of stocks, each one having a different delay period.

NMS-Tier 1: any stock listed in the S&P 500 - 2 week  report to publish delay

NMS-Tier 2: any stock not in the S&P 500 but still traded on NYSE - 4 week report to publish delay

OTCE: all other stocks - 4 week report to publish delay

This means the newest data we can get on AMC and GME is atleast 1 month old, at worst almost 2 MONTHS OLD. Next important bit is that the ""Shares"" figure is TOTAL TRADED SHARES. For context, the definition of a trade is ""the result of a single action to buy or sell"" [source](https://pocketsense.com/considered-trade-stocks-6580885.html) Therefore, that 1 billion shares of AMC Citadel traded over the course of a month is very vague. They could have bought 500M then sold them all, naked shorted 1B shares to brokerages, or they could be our biggest whale and own 2x the public float. WE DON'T KNOW. All we know is that these were shares bought/sold between Citadel and other market makers or brokerages. 

&#x200B;

**FRAME OF REFFERENCE**

So now that we know what the data means, we can start comparing it to other data for other stocks to see if it has any relevance toward a squeeze. There are 2 ways that immediately come to mind for this comparison, as a percentage of public float, and as a percentage of volume traded on public exchanges during the same time period. If there is a correlation in either of these, it may be possible to determine the nature of these trades. *hint hint*

I will try to be brief on calculations, I welcome you to do them yourselves and check my work, but here is what I found analyzing AMC (January), GME (January), AAPL(January), TSLA(June 2020), and SENS(January). I tried choosing a diverse set of stocks and am using TSLA data from during the short squeeze as a baseline to look for commonalities. I'm not good at statistics. If you have suggestions on how to improve this analysis let me know. I did this for both specifically Citadel, and for total OTC trades. I used Yahoo Finance for my float and volume data for each stock.

AMC - Float: 403,790,000- Volume January: 4,619,495,600

Citadel OTC Trades: 1,097,324,882 

Citadel OTC % of Float: 271.7%

Citadel OTC % of Volume: 23.75%

Total OTC Trades:  2,066,125,394 

Total OTC % of Float: 511.7%

Total OTC % of Volume: 44.72%

Citadel OTC % of Volume: 16.32%

Total OTC Trades: 1,001,461,355 

Total OTC % of Float: 5.97%

Total OTC % of Volume: 44.70%

&#x200B;

TSLA - Float: 154,264,000- Volume June: 1,736,284,800

Citadel OTC Trades:  327,584,252 

Citadel OTC % of Float: 212.35%

Citadel OTC % of Volume: 18.87%

Total OTC Trades: 849,798,671 

Total OTC % of Float: 550.87%

Total OTC % of Volume: 48.94%

&#x200B;

SENS - Float: 268,460,000 - Volume January: 1,494,704,800

Citadel OTC Trades: 333,714,744  

Citadel OTC % of Float: 124.3%

Citadel OTC % of Volume: 22.32%

Total OTC Trades: 790,794,579 

Total OTC % of Float: 294.57%

Total OTC % of Volume: 52.91%

&#x200B;

**ANALYSIS:**

There are definitely many more ways to you could compare the numbers, other than percent of float and percent of volume, but my point in doing it those two ways are this, we are trying to figure out if this is extraordinary market activity not if this is just what normally happens in the market on a day to day basis. Additionally we want to find the nature of these OTC trades. 

From this data, I believe there is a clear correlation between Volume and OTC trades. This is EXPECTED in an ordinary market. To put this in a more logical way of thinking, lets say all us apes go out and by a share of GME. Our brokerage now need to find someone selling this share to get it from. Sometimes this is a paper hand selling out, other times (from the data I'm going to hazard a guess around 50%) it is a market maker trying to profit off of the bid ask spread. Keep in mind, OTC is between MARKET MAKERS AND BROKERAGES. Citadel has BOTH a hedgefund AND a market making division.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

I believe the activity seen in the OTC markets for AMC and GME is ordinary market activity and that OTC trades in fact correlate to trading volume. I believe the Citadel referenced in FINRA is the market making division and NOT the hedge fund. I believe based on the data I found this is not evidence of hidden shorts, and instead just bid-ask farming by market makers.  

With all that being said, I still have faith in the stock. I have no plans to sell my 300 AMC and 10 GME shares. I like the stocks, and I think the +20% today shows well for there future. I just want to educate my fellow apes and clear up any confusion about what all this means. Feel free to give any questions/criticism.

3/22/21 09:38,"Correlation between GME and other Melvin Capital Holdings **TLDR:** 

1. **The price of a number of other stocks that Melvin Capital held short positions in closely correlate with GME's. It's not just AMC/GME. (BBBY, IRBT, FIZZ and GSX)**
2. **Melvin Capital held put positions in these tickers but closed them during Q4 of 2020, before all of them went through a period of volatility along with GME.** 
3. **MC hold a put position in $AG, a silver mining company that was shilled on WSB during the 'silver squeeze' bullshit, which also followed a similiar pattern to GME in January with a rapid run-up around the 27th January.** 

Link to Melvin Capital 13F filings i.e. MC's holdings, use the 'quarter to view' drop-down to select which quarter to view. 

[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link)

From that you can view or download an excel file of MC's holdings - up to Q4 of 2020. 

Back at the end of January I was looking at the day's biggest movers on yahoo, and noticed that a few silver mining companies had gone up by around 20-25%.  This was at the time that all that bullshit about a 'silver squeeze' was going round, so I thought it was interesting. One stood out in particular: $AG, because I had seen it mentioned in a lot of the shill posts about buying silver. Knowing that the whole 'silver squeeze' thing was total bullshit manufactured by someone with money and a motive i.e. probably Melvin Capital, the ones who had an incentive to divert WSB attention (and money) away from GME, I started to look at the day's other biggest movers. Strap your tinfoil hats on boys and girls.

Like I say, what I did was go through that day's (28th Jan) biggest movers, and then I looked in the 13F filing available for Melvin Capital to see if MC had positions in any of them. At the time that I was looking at this, I was using the 2020 Q3 13F holdings, but since then the Q4 13F's have been made available. I'll get on to that in a minute though. First though, I want to show you the chart for GME/SPY. 

&#x200B;

As you can see, during the Jan/Feb squeeze (Gamma/short, whatever your opinion is on that) GME practically inverses SPY. Correlation doesn't demonstrate causation however: the point I'm making is that this is the trend that SPY was following at the time, so any correlation between GME and another stock can't really be put down to just general market trends. 

Now, these are the stocks I identified as having a significant price movement at the end of January which MC had put positions in as of the end of Q3.

**$BBBY**

[GME in orange, BBBY in Green. ](https://preview.redd.it/g11nca6cago61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=d23715bfefb01a62cc75f05da1ee870985b41f8b)

MC position as of Q3 13F:

PUT. Market value: $48,385,000. Also their 69th biggest holding. Nice. 

Another interesting thing about $BBBY is this:

[**https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693**](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693)

Cramer made a couple tweets about BBBY and linked them to WSB. Pretty sure there's one where he actually tried to driect WSB's attention to BBBY but I can't find it. 

&#x200B;

**$IRBT**

[$IRBT in blue GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/3zt6lrlwago61.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e5e0c62df6aefb1156dcb9f25c374542926c6c3)

MC held a $37,950,000 market value PUT according to 13F filings for Q3. 

**$GSX**

[GSX in purple GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/t6jgqm8obgo61.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=345c6d445d3dcb6f135f9b2b4345ae280bf6357c)

MC held a  $54,408,000 put position. 

**Finally, $AG**

https://preview.redd.it/5jxfgox6mgo61.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a06d6c5dda93a145a35672dd32550a5472c8be0

Now, I can't find any AG position for MC in Q3, however for Q4, they added an entirely new position. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0hyt7fsmgo61.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d20308204d103dfd2c3e93cf94698d16eca5a11

That's a brand new put position in the 4th quarter of 2020 worth $74m USD. If anyone has got the ticker mention data I think it would be really interesting to see the ticker mentions of things like $SLV and $AG around this period. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now to cover the Q3 vs Q4 filings, below are the Q4 statements for the previous tickers  that I stated MC held put positions in for Q3:

&#x200B;

[BBBY](https://preview.redd.it/ye0b1yt4pgo61.png?width=1767&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8bd937433f7fb72167ee77f06ea80317e82e72)

So there was a correlation between GME and a number of other stocks that MC held short positions in as of Q3 of 2020, but they abruptly closed these positions out in Q4, before the volatility early in Q1 of 2021. 

**So to summarise:** 

1. There is a correlation between GME and a number of other tickers that Melvin Capital held PUT positions in (according to their **Q3** 13F filings) for the period from around the 27th Jan to early Febuary 2021. 
2. According to Melvin Capital's  Q4 13F filings however, MC closed these put positions before the end of Q4. They closed their PUT positions *before* the run-up that occured in late-January 2021 across these stocks. 
3. MC opened a put position in $AG in Q4, a ticker that had a sudden, massive increase in the number of mentions on WSB around the same time GME reached it's peak. The consensus at the time was that the 'silver squeeze' was a ploy to divert the attention of WSB onto something else away from GME. 

There are probably other tickers that could fit here that I've missed too. 

**So what the fuck are we supposed to make of this?**

Could MC have known that something was about to happen with these tickers? Why is there a correlation between a video game retailer and a soda producer? A consumer robot manufacturer (IRBT) and fucking bed-bath-and-beyond? Did MC run-up these tickers in order to reposition their short positions from new highs? 

Once the Q1 2020 13F's are released it will likely shed some light on what has gone on here but until then, unfortunately, it's up to the collective 14 brain cells of the WSB community to try and figure out if there's something going on here and whether that can give us information relating to GME (and possibly other tickers) going forward.

3/22/21 03:18,"AMC why it's all good from friday's Quadruple witching hour.  

Why we should be happy with Friday's AMC closing at 13.93. Wasn't AMC stuck at the $8 level just 2 weeks prior? If you were to ask me during the first week of March would I be happy to see AMC reach 12 and beyond by quadruple witching March 19, I'd be ecstatic if $14 can be established as the new base.

Here's why this $14 is a new base. Biggest white elephant in the AMC room was when Wanda Group converted all the [B shares to A](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). With about [44 million A common shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wanda-group-trimming-holdings-142528503.html) that you know Wanda is itching to cash out, Wanda Group was always a threat how they would be disposing of their shares. Well this Friday March 19, what many people did not notice was a flash block trade at 2 seconds after closing.

&#x200B;

[spot the elephant leaving the room?](https://preview.redd.it/qpq8gw220fo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23166f1766cabe53fee69c8975190469cffa8e76)

That's 45 million shares at 13.93 totaling $630 million. Ladies and gentlemen, Wanda has left the building. So we should be thankful that Wanda did not recklessly dump their shares in the market. Instead they found a banker or bankers to take up the entire 45M share quota. I'm guessing it's Goldman Sachs and B. Riley Securities since those two were of critical help during their [cash crisis in Nov last year](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-to-issue-20-million-shares-of-common-stock-61282394).

This share deal doesn't happen instantly, but takes days or weeks to negotiate. It's an educated but realistic guess that Wanda has been wanting to sell it shares and would be happy at a $15 range. Just follow Silverlake who also immediately on January 27 converted their [$600 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000119312521022799/d30907dsc13da.htm) debt into common share at 13.51 and immediately sold into the market starting at what price? 13.55 - 14.5 range then all the way up to $24. Don't know how they sold 200k shares at $24 but that's what is filed.

So Wanda wanted to follow Silverlake's lead but were just too late when they filed the papers to [convert on Feb1](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). Luckily they waited instead of just dumping, until AMC revived to above 10. By then they reached an agreement with bankers probably at $14. This is all guessing here and not established fact (except for that 45M block trade).

But if that's what happened, that's good for us because it means a big bank (Goldman? Riley?) is willing to take up a wholesale $630 million equity share position on AMC at 13.93 /share cost and will be retail selling these shares at 16 dollars and above? 18 dollars and above? 20 dollars and above? Once again based on Silverlake's move, they can see AMC going to 24 dollars.

If a deal was struck with Wanda at about $14, then it was imperative for them to make sure AMC stocks had to land at $14 dollars by end of Friday March 19. That's what we observed happening all day Friday trading.

If this is what happened, we should count ourselves fortunate because it's now a big banker who will be establishing $14 as the new base.

Go AMC, go Apes.

*As an addendum to my previous post on delta hedging*

Delta hedging, pin risk, gamma, max pain: 

**Dynamic delta hedging** -

Ex: AMC a dealer sold a $14 3/19 call on 3/9 when the stock was at $10. The delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $11, delta goes to 40%, they buy more. Stock goes down to $9, delta goes to 20%, they sell more. 

This week stock was drifting higher and $14 call sellers are buying more stock while $14 put sellers are ALSO buying. When the stock is at $10 the chance of a $14 call being ITM in a week is... 30% let‚Äôs say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $14 put being ITM is let‚Äôs say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock.
With the stock at $13.50 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example. 

This week a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. At the same time this is happening to the whole options chain. Tada! A **gamma squeeze**. 

The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn‚Äôt hedge fast enough and lost money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options.

‚ÄúGamma squeezes‚Äù work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of a $14 call being exercised is dropping. 

**Explaining price action Friday afternoons**:

Ok, so we‚Äôve discussed dynamic delta hedging and how dealers are hedging their exposure constantly. They‚Äôre not waiting until Friday at 4:00 to find out if they‚Äôre on the hook for millions of dollars.

Let‚Äôs keep using AMC as an example. Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $14.  Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.

Dealers short calls all the way up to $13.50 are almost 100% hedged (they‚Äôve bought almost 100% of their stock). The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let‚Äôs say.... $14.50 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) 

Reminder: A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral. As the day goes on the dealers short $13.50 calls are buying more stock to get to 100% hedged and the dealers short $14.50 calls are selling more stock to get to 0% hedged.

*(By Friday afternoon having a lot of open interest in higher $ strikes starts to work against longs. ‚ÄúCharm‚Äù is causing the delta on those OTM calls to drop by the minute.)*

The problem for the dealer short the $14 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $13.95 and $14.05  the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It‚Äôs the rate of change of the delta. It‚Äôs changing a lot!)

**Right around $14 it‚Äôs a huge question mark** whether remaining open call and put options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn‚Äôt know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. If the stock closes at $13.95, calls won‚Äôt be exercised, they don‚Äôt need to have shares. If the stock closes at $14.05 calls will be exercised, they need to have shares. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $14 and buying every time it goes above $14. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $14 put wants to be long 100% of their exposure at $13.98 and 0% at $14.02. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

So. The reason you‚Äôll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses (remember very few options are actually exercised) 
b) lots and lots of dealer hedging in both directions. 

There is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry. Generally if dealers are net short vol you‚Äôll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they‚Äôre net long vol you‚Äôll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn‚Äôt the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!) A lot of times a big-ish movement right before the close is dealers capitulating and getting squared to be 100% hedged or 0% hedged. Nobody is leaving their desk Friday afternoon potentially long or short millions of extra shares.

**Max pain theory**- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the ‚Äúmaximum pain‚Äù to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $10 yesterday so it didn‚Äôt totally apply https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/SPY (Don‚Äôt get cute and try to trade off this, you‚Äôll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $14 so while not quite ‚ÄúMax pain,‚Äù the stock ending the day below $14 did cause ‚Äúpain‚Äù to some remaining call holders. GME Max pain was $150, but there was ‚Äúpain‚Äù for remaining $200 put holders.

*It‚Äôs also quite possible that there really was a large natural seller at $14. Again, this is not manipulation.*

**The pin risk ‚Äúproblem‚Äù** revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $13.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $14.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $13.95 or $$14.05 or $13.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers ‚Äúauto-exercise‚Äù any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct ‚ÄúDNE‚Äù- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours. 

*IE, you own a $14 AMC put. Stock closes at $13.93 on Friday and you‚Äôre in the money. At 4:05 it‚Äôs announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $20 a share. You call your broker and scream ‚Äúdo not exercise!!‚Äù 

*You own a $200 GME call. Stock closes at $200.27 and you‚Äôre in the money. At 4:05 it‚Äôs announced that GME is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream ‚Äúdo not exercise!!‚Äù
More likely a bunch of idiots bought $200 calls and don‚Äôt have the cash to take delivery so the options aren‚Äôt exercised. 

Some brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. So dealers do have some incentive to push the price to where options won‚Äôt be exercised so they aren‚Äôt taking some weekend risk. The dollars here are small though... it‚Äôs not, ‚Äúif it closes above $200 I‚Äôm screwed and have to buy millions of dollars of stock,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúif it closes above $200 there‚Äôs still some uncertainty on whether I‚Äôll be assigned on some calls that are still open so I‚Äôm taking some weekend risk.‚Äù **MOST of the options have already been closed out before 4 PM. Most options buyers do not exercise.**

On SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers. 

So there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it‚Äôs really very small. And then it‚Äôs a new week and we‚Äôre off to the races again :)

3/21/21 05:04,"The AMC Stock vote will be a resounding YES on the part of the Majority, and how it affects you. Read more inside. So this isn't a new tactic by a long shot, and this has been around for ages, but it's time we talked about something that corporations and especially boards of directors and large fund managers use when shuffling corporate wealth and influence around during periods of restructuring.

The majority shareholders absolutely want the value of $AMC to go down. Why? They need to buy A WHOLE LOT OF IT.

Of course they know issuing more will devalue the shares significantly, but only for a very short period of time.

Welcome to a second type of short , the inside short. In order for a company to shore up it's own valuation, it will issue large amounts of it's own shares in order to lower it's own price per share. They will immediately snap these up in bulk to hold as much of the stake in the company as possible.

Here comes the fucky part... Ready? When they have these majority cheap shares, and the market is flooded with shares under value, they wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit. There's two things that happen here, there will be FUD, which leads to selloff, and there will be just plain more shares. They will snap up as much of these stocks as possible until things are normal again. This is called a Stock Buyback. That's when they issue what's called a stock reverse split.

The stock reverse split suddenly takes their 200 Million shares and turns it back into a reasonable 20 or even 5 million shares. The value stays the same, but the cost of owning just one share just became a little more difficult to pony up to. This means they maintain their status as majority shareholders, but they also cannot be taken out by a outside investor who is soaking up penny shares on the outside market. Consider that right now, you have a weighted vote in AMC. Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50, or even 5. Sure it's worth the same amount of money, but it doesn't carry the same weight in the company. 200 Votes isn't the same as 5 votes. They've marginalized low end shareholders and shored their positions.

This is how companies control board room decisions and how they ensure that control over corporate direction is firmly in the hands of the people they decide they want it to be. You can't trickle your way into a deciding factor in a major shareholder vote. You are either in the money, or you're left out in the rain.

Edit:

Everyone should remember that a LONG position on this stock may be the best position to take on this. It's not that the stock is doomed, but the MOASS is probably doomed for sure.

AMC saw what happened to GME. They are not in a position to accept becoming the next volatility stock. They're literally opening their doors this weekend. They are not in a position to become a meme when they are about to stabilize their business for the first time after a complete year of lockdowns and shutdown businesses.

Thanks for the Silver. This was my DD. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk: Note. None of this is financial advice. Almost all of us, including me are literally cats.

Edit 2 :

So lets talk volume. This is what becomes the most important. I THINK this is what most people fail to grasp. You own 5000 shares out of 1 million, but 10 million come up tomorrow. You are now swimming in a much larger sea. Previously, you were, perhaps a middling to un-fuck-withable predator. Now the sea or lake as you would prefer has gotten much bigger. MUCH MUCH bigger. You are now much much smaller. In order to maintain your size, you must consume a lot more shares and, even though they come cheap, it will cost you that much more money to get back to your previous position. Now you need to own 500k shares JUST to be back to where you started. Growing bigger got much more expensive, and it gets more expensive as the company continues to do well. The longer you wait to get into the pool, the more it costs you.

This is why they issue more shares and eventually why they drain the pool when they are satisfied with what is available.  


Edit 3 :  


So some of you have talked about a share count or what is considered a round robin. THAT WOULD BE GLORIOUS. I would probably be set to make a untold massive amount of money since the MOASS would almost trigger immediately. All things considered, either scenario I feel will be positive. AMC will not lose major value and the MOASS will not be a disaster for their volatility. They want to own their position, it's not really about saving the hedgies, it's about stability. As I've said to another poster, the problem isn't the way up, it's the way down. The down can land anywhere and they don't want to play the game on where it ends up. Right now they are on stable ground with stock and reopening. Meme stocking them right at this moment would be a disaster for their company when they are on opening week+(end)",42841,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998001397,True

**A BRIEF LOOK BACK**

So as we all know, GameStop took off in January. A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. 

He likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.

AMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. 

Both of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.

All we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.

ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.

**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**

Here we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. 

AMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.

These are just a few. There are more.

Below is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as we're living in times that are uncharted and have not yet been witnessed in finance. We are all a little piece of collective history!

Remember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:

1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.

2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing ""Emergency Relief"" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) 

3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)

4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.

5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. 

6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they're desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they'll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they're at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.

7. DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING. - even if he sells, we've seen the numbers, the data, the hearing, the documentary..this game hasn't Stopped. üöÄ

8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. 


We're living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we've made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we're up against.

I'm here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let's keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.

To the hedgefunds? I hope you're scared. I hope you're nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you've so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you're fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. 

To all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are.

If BIGC was ever going to squeeze, it would be this month. Tons of contracts waiting to go ITM.

**The BULL CASE:**

**Earnings:**

Since BIGC's IPO it has **consistently beat the earnings estimates set forth** by wall street **INCREASING IN REVENUE EACH TIME**. Lets look at the prices they were trading at during each beat:

9/9/20 - trading at 100's

11/5/20 - trading at mid-80's ??

2/22/21 - trading high 60's?????

As of the time I'm writing this the stock price is 56.69???????????!!! It makes absolutely no sense as to why this stock is trading so low given it's past trading prices and continuous earnings beats.

**Technical Analysis:**

1. Clear as day inverse head and shoulders
2. Very nice bounce off of previous support (First shoulder - WHICH LEFT A HUGE BOTTOMING TAIL ON HUGE VOLUME)
3. higher low from head to second shoulder
4. Huge green candle on a reversal doji
5. huge relative strength to market selloff on witching day close

Just look at yday (quad witching) and today and which candles had volume. Specifically look at the EOD candles and compare them to the overall market. On Quad-Witching close, it resisted the sell off EOD very well with NARROW HUGE VOLUME candles, which I can only assume to be bullish. (see above)

**Analysts:**

I believe that analysts are starting to flip the switch to bullish. Watching the price carefully the past few weeks I believe that insane accumulation / covering is going on.

LETS LOOK AT THE 2 MOST RECENT ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES + MY THOUGHTS

**FOLLOW THE CIRCLES**

https://preview.redd.it/jgluwnuv3no61.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3dadb59c7a465eff435c85a0410132c6387d181

1. ER BEAT AND FELL
2. DEAL WITH WALMART ANNOUNCED (bought up)
3. **Upgrade - KeyBanc Capital Markets - Sector Weight ‚Üí Overweight - $75**
   1. THEY ALREADY ACCUMULATED ON THAT DIP SO THEY LET OUT AN UPGRADE
4. Market fell recently, that was the dip (which was bought up straight away) - look at SPY
5. **Initiated - JP Morgan - Neutral - $55**
   1. possible that they accumulated both on bubble 2 and 4.

Match these series of events up with the TA in the section above and it checks out for a move higher!

I just wanted to write something short on why I think BIGC is going to rip. RISKY AND THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!

**EDIT: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHOP AND BIGC:**

So I'll explain it in the way that I understand the differences. They do NOT have the same target audience although they have some overlap.

**Simply put** \- SHOP likes startups (people like you and me if we wanted to get into an ecommerce business), and BIGC likes established businesses. SHOP has more volume of customers, but BIGC deals with clients at an enterprise level and makes a lot more per client. Say SHOP can make 3000/yr off an individuals store, BIGC can make hundreds of thousands /yr off of 1 client.

**Bit more in depth** \-

**How SHOP makes money**

1. Monthly Subscriptions in tiers
2. Commission per sale
3. Credit Card Fees

Again, SHOP is great for small individuals - easy service + quick store creation for fast sales.

**How BIGC makes money**

BIGC

1. Monthly Subscriptions
   1. This is their main income - As their client's business grows, they automatically upgrade the client's subscription tier (from what I understand).
2. Less Commission per sale
3. Smaller CC Fees

Faster service to help clients manage their stores (code-wise and whatever else). Say a client needed to change significant things about their site / data collection - requiring a couple hundred lines of code - BIGC is more suited to help with that. Cheaper for enterprises that already sell in large volumes (less in commissions than SHOP).

**Where clients overlap and where they differ**

In terms of small businesses, BIGC can absolutely eat into SHOP's clientele based on the needs of that business. Where it differs is, SHOP isn't designed to benefit huge enterprises who already have huge volumes of sales and don't want to pay commission per sale. \*\*In this case SHOP CANNOT hold a candlelight to BIGC's huge clientele ,\*\*simply due to how their infrastructure is set up. Tech + cost wise, BIGC will be the choice between the two for a large business.

THEN I STARTED READING STUFF ABOUT IT.

This is a slow moving stock, BUT has several catalysts that should easily make for some quick gains (not financial advice) to roll around in or re-invest in GME/AMC/etc.   This reminds me a bit of the short RKT saga, but I am not suggesting there will be a squeeze, just tendies.  

Catalysts:

\- Ex Dividend Date on 3/30, which means buying the stonk and holding to get dividend, or calls for THIS FRIDAY to play on the anticipated buying pressure of others getting in for dividend.   Dividend will then be paid out on 4/30.  This is a REIT with a 10.21 div yield, i.e. very high dividend all things relative, so not a bad place to park your money for a second.

\- Earnings call on 4/26

\- COVID impacts starting to waiver.  NLY is a mortgage REIT, the general consensus seems to be that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with COVID, i.e. stonks like this that got hammered are buy opportunities. 

\-Look at the 1 week chart and call prices.  Calls won't get you the dividend and of course are more risky, so buying the stock or playing the options are both viable depending on risk tolerance.

Yes today was a tough day. But take a step back and take a look at the bigger picture. We have formed a very nice ascending channel since Feb. 5 and have tested the bottom at least 5 times. Today we reached the bottom, and the chart is already showing signs of a bounce. We are looking to hold $10.50 support (bottom of the channel) and failing that, we have VERY strong support at $10. We‚Äôll see at open tomorrow but it will take considerable sell or short pressure to push it down by more than 5%.. We may have lost some ground but we have solid support at the $10.00 price.

Incase you can't see, RKT 20.02%, GME 15%, AMC 8.75%If you're like me I'm fucking tired of dealing with these shit heads, But they all have one common enemy in all three of them **CITADEL**. Kenneth fucked you, and me out of one of the biggest potential squeezes that would have ever happened, it does not matter what we do we can never get those hours back that we missed due to them restricting  our trading.

We we're given another opportunity to get back at these fuck heads,Of the three stocks currently as it stands **RKT is the only one actually primed for a short squeeze here is why.**

Quicken Loans (RKT) is the nations number 1 mortgage lender, quarter after quarter, year after year RKT continues to crush earnings. The reason people do not jump on RKT as it's viewed as just a mortgage company and not a fintech(upstart) even though RKT has literally it's hand in every single lending area that you can think of.

The reason why shorts love to short RKT is due to the low float %, and the fact that normally RKT volume is pretty shit so in return it makes it extremely easy for these dick heads to pin the stock where they want it to be, Yesterday we broke 7m volume 2 hours into the day which was the previous days max and we witnessed the stock shoot from 23 to 24.60 and back down due to shorts tripling down after covering the week before, the market taking a shit, overall volume starting to decrease.

RKT has the best fundamentals of the three companies, from 2019 to 2020 they grew Revenue from 5.1billion to 15.7 billion and net income from 0.9 billion to 9.4 billion, Current target price per analysts is 25.08 which is just the floor for where this stock could really go, with all the BS going on RKT is the only one not completely fucking tanking.

If you're tired of letting shorts raw dog you as I am, get out of your feelings and bias for whatever you believe in  and realize with low float % it also means we can drive this bitch up without much work Buy RKT, Hold RKT, and let's all squeeze Citadel and Kenneth's fucking nutsack until he gives us enough tendies so that we can buy GameStop or AMC instead of fucking shares.

TLDR: üöÄ**RKT has the most SI of GME, and AMC. Fuck citadel they like fucking these 3 stocks, Buy RKT until we squeeze Kenneth by his fucking nutsack and we launch RKT to the moon like the rocket it is. ü¶çApes only strong if togetherüöÄ**

On February 18 and February 22, the Market Maker (MM) JANE appeared on 36 of the highest volume stocks in the OTC.  Some examples include OZSC, AITX, GAXY, TSNPD, AABB, ENZC, INKW, OPTI, NSAV, PVDG and WDLF.  Later that number increased to 78 stocks.  February 22 is also the same day that GME and AMC began trending upward again after a dip that lasted for a couple weeks.

Have you ever noticed that many of your big OTC stocks tend to follow the exact same price curves, dips, spikes and dumps at the same time?  This manipulation from JANE is why, and based on the timeline of JANE's appearance in these high volume OTC stocks, the evidence suggests that JANE is heavily manipulating the OTC downward using tactics of naked shorting, dark pool selling and Not-Held Orders in some connection with the fight against retail in GME and AMC.

3/27/21 02:10,"Suez canal and (short term) oil/shipping We all know by now the Suez canal is blocked and recent updates say it can take a few days or a few weeks to clear.  It's a big ship, and it's a small canal so they will literally need to dig this thing out and use tug boats to try and straighten it out again.  If they do clear it over the weekend, then Monday will likely see a drop however if they don't then I expect prices to push up fast due to panic.  It's high risk, high reward.

**So, how do you profit from this?**  Oil shipping companies of course but not just any company, ones that primarily operate between the middle east and Asia.  See the Panama canal is fine so getting OIL to the US isn't the issue.

**How do I know what Oil shipping companies then?**  Look for the companies that have their fleet comprised of Suezmax vessels.  You see, just as the name implies, these are the largest ships made that fit through the Suez canal and the companies that use these ship usually ship primarily to Asian markets.

With the canal locked down, they must go around Africa now which is an extra 14 days.  While spot prices vary a lot, recent (before the blockage) was 16-20k a day.  Now factor in 14 extra says on each trip AND that with longer trips, less ships are available meaning higher spot prices.  These two factors together result in stock going up.

No it's not a distraction from GME or AMC, buy whatever stock you want.  I also don't consider this a long term play. Once the canal is cleared prices will begin to go down pretty fast.

**Tickers to look into:**  There are plenty to look into, but these are above the market cap:   EURN and STNG.   Added bonus is if you actually do want to hold them, sell some CC's and hope for strong dividends at the next earning.

3/27/21 01:35,"AMC - 500M Additional Shares DD and Theory So I‚Äôve been pondering why AMC would put out a proxy vote to add 500M additional and I have 3 working theories.

1. Increase Liquidity

I‚Äôve had this thought brewing in my mind for some time and investopedia kind of confirmed it. If retailers and institutions own as many shares as I believe to be held which is relatively near the max outstanding shares available on the market, it has this effect.

Essentially a lack a liquidity or volume of available shares creates immense volatility. Think about it like a fault line in the earth, every time it shifts it creates an earthquake. It starts off on high wave fluctuation and then subsides.

When you have a lack of available shares, available sellers asks and new buyers bids will be farther apart. 

2. Ownership Concerns

So this theory builds on the idea that Wanda Group converted shares to Class A in order to sell them off. The day of March 19th we couldn‚Äôt break $14. I either thought manipulation, but one of my peers brought to my attention that if Wanda had sold all of its shares at that price it would roughly had the same effect. 

When Wanda sacrificed its Class B shares, it also sacrificed majority voting power. Essentially I don‚Äôt know who the hell controls the majority voting power, but I‚Äôm 90% sure it‚Äôs retail investors as a whole.

AMC might be trying to regain ownership with the additional 500M shares because that‚Äôs 51% of outstanding shares.

3. Additional Capital

AMC may see an opportunity to raise additional capital by selling additional shares with the current public interest in the stock. I don‚Äôt fault them for that, but it‚Äôs not good for us either way.

Conclusion 

These theories are all speculative, but I believe derived from decent ü¶ç analysis. I voted no on just about everything in the proxy vote. Especially the additional 500M shares because that means dilution and the price will more than likely drop given the company‚Äôs current fundamentals.

This isn‚Äôt financial advice, just my own wrinkle free brain analysis.

Edit 1

The inverse of these scenarios (500M additional shares not approved) would be in my opinion as follows

1. Liquidity Decreases

Good for apes, high volatility means higher and also lower swings.

2. Ownership is Unclear

There could potentially be a grab for ownership meaning increased buying pressure.

3. No Additional Capital is Raised

AMC would have to trust that ü¶çs return to the theaters and begin generating profits. No dilution. ü¶çs retain faith in AMC.",43670,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.933947921,True

But perhaps the real story of the weekend happened overseas, where  ""Godzilla vs. Kong""  exploded onto the scene with a  terrific $121.8 million debut BEFORE  North America release this Wednesday night 3/31

3/31/21 12:40,"AMC - A Perspective On Opportunity Investing in meme stocks alone is unique by itself. I think we all have an opportunity to invest in things that we either cared about when we were younger or things we enjoy doing. I‚Äôm might speak out of turn here, but I look at the recovery of Six Flags stock and I‚Äôm like damn, missed a 5 bagger and it was right there in front of me the whole time. Or you take any business environment that has been disrupted by COVID and some have been quicker to recover than others.

Im presenting the bullish case for AMC to be a COVID recovery play and not so much a squeeze play. Granted there are ways in which it could squeeze, but they have been speculation thus far. We have no way knowing the conditions truthfully without data or facts to back it up. Most of what I have seen borders on conspiracy and this is an effort to clear the air.

Invest in what you care about! I went to AMC Theaters last Saturday and I had a blast watching Nobody. I got my popcorn, my blue slurpee, and my sour patch kids. I enjoyed my experience. That‚Äôs what I paid $50 for. To take my GF and I out to get out of the house and engage in an activity. 

AMC presents an opportunity to not just invest in something you care about, but also actively contribute to the wellbeing of the company. In so many words you can support your investment by having fun and enjoying the movie going experience. Yes this applies to other theater stocks. But I like AMC, it reminds me of my childhood. 

AMC has debt. That is a well known factor of this stock. I don‚Äôt expressly know their current debt amount, but with people returning to theaters it can recover. I did the math and if everyone in this group on average spent $50 on one movie go including tickets, food, and drink, it would be about $450M if everyone went to the theaters on the same day. Is that realistic? Probably not, but could be a possibility. Imagine with COVID restrictions being lifted later this year what it could do for generating profits? Well you might say, the movie industry is dying. I don‚Äôt think it is because you pay for an experience to do something fun with your kids, friends, or your wife‚Äôs boyfriend.

I still think regardless of a squeeze play, it can be a recovery play. With or without a squeeze I am bullish and confident in AMC recovering from COVID and moving past the debt hurdle.

I like movies and I like the stock!

Long time lurker, first time poster, all time stock-Ape.

Maybe we could play the hedge funds game... We all know they view us as teen/nerds/retards/living-at-moma-basement... and hell are they RIGHT! They think they're smarter than us, and hell are they RIGHT... AGAIN...

My idea is: If we act like they won, they may get overconfindent. They hope our monkey brain gives up, they hope we get tired, just like a teen with a new video game (their words, not mine)

How could we do it:

First: Of course, fucking retards, KEEP HOLDING ! Mark Cuban told you so, and you're gonna listen to him like the pretty bitch you are.

Second: Let's act as if our teen-short-attention-span took holidays from GME, AMC yada yada... and focus on something else. I know we don't talk internet shiny bling bling here, but I am thinking about the canine one, it's cheap and still have a huge media coverage.

4/5/21 03:47,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made 2 days back. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.

**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported

* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.
* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.

**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab‚Ñ¢ stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. 

**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.

**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound 

**SOME FAQ‚Äôs:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The   purpose of this post is to provide an objective, rational review of  the  adverse factors that already have impacted the price of AMC stock,  or  may do so in the future. These factors continue to be largely  ignored by  the mainstream subreddits.

This   is not financial advice or analysis, but rather a restatement of   publicly available data to counter some of the overly optimistic or   straight up misleading ‚ÄúDDs‚Äù  that choose to gloss over the reality of   the company‚Äôs fundamentals.

&#x200B;

1. **AMC market cap and price per share was in steady decline pre-Covid**

* [Market cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap) has been declining since 2017 (highest point circa 6.3B in 2017 compared to 2.6B in 2018, 1.7B in 2019 and then 4.24B today) even pre-Covid.

&#x200B;

2. **AMC‚Äôs shares were significantly diluted in the past 12 months**

* AMC issued 278M new shares in the past 12 months

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   ‚ÄúDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 91.0 million shares‚Ä¶   In January 2021, we sold approximately 187.0 million shares.‚Äù

* Additionally,   more shares were issued to AMC‚Äôs debt holders (convertible notes)  which  exercised their rights to convert those notes into shares. This,   however, helped reduce company‚Äôs debt and annual interest expense (but   worsened the dilution).

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   ‚ÄúThe January 2021 conversion by holders ‚Ä¶ of our ‚Ä¶ Notes ‚Ä¶ into shares   of our Class A common stock‚Ä¶, which resulted in the issuance of   44,422,860 shares.‚Äù

* Even more shares were added to the float through various programs such as stock based compensation program, [*increasing the float*](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/amc/) *from 52M to now 450M in a span of a little over a year*.

&#x200B;

3. **Request to authorize more shares may lead to significant further dilution**

* AMC requested its shareholders approval to issue up to 500M additional shares ([SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)), which would effectively more than double the float.
* While   no immediate share issuance is proposed, as indicated above AMC did  not  hesitate to rather materially dilute its shares in 2020/Q1 of 2021.

&#x200B;

4. **AMC balance sheet continues to be severely burdened with debt**

* [Total liabilities](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/chart/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=id:liabilities,include:true,,&chartType=interactive&correlations=&dateSelection=range&displayDateRange=false&displayTicker=false&endDate=&format=real&legendOnChart=true&maxPoints=&note=&partner=basic_850&quoteLegend=true&quotes=&recessions=false&redesign=false&scaleType=linear&securities=id:AMC,include:true,,&securityGroup=&securitylistName=&securitylistSecurityId=&source=false&splitType=single&startDate=&title=&units=false&useCustomColors=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=5&chartView=&liveData=false) increased from 6.6B in 2017 to 8B in 2019 to now 13.3B in 2021
* Further   increases in debt may cause share prices to drop. AMC is cautiously   optimistic about having sufficient cash to last them through March 2022,   but this is contingent on theaters starting to generate significant   revenue by Q3

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   ‚Äú\[F\]uture offerings of debt, which would be senior to our Class A   common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, could   adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock

4/11/21 06:35,"American Tower (AMT): the best way to play the coming 5G boom. **American Tower**

For those of you that actually enjoy reading a good DD, this one is for you. I have followed Wall Street Bets for a while, and personally, I can‚Äôt wait for GameStop and AMC to fade away so people actually get back to posting about long ideas that might be worth my time and money. I know that some of you are busy gambling on dying businesses like GameStop or AMC, but I‚Äôm here to let you in on a secret.

The company I will be diving into today is the single best way to play the coming 5G boom in America and the expansion of existing cell networks around the world. American Tower (AMT) is the world‚Äôs largest REIT with a market cap just over 100B and they are the largest owner of cell towers in the world. Some of you have already checked out because REITs are for boomers, but AMT is growing fast and is a vital piece of the world‚Äôs communication infrastructure. If you think that 5-10 years from now people around the world will own more cell phones, make more phone calls, and use more mobile data, AMT is a great way to get a piece of the growing 5G pie.

AMT builds cell towers around the world and then rents them out to telecommunications companies like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile (and the international equivalents). American Tower has over 186,000 communications sites in 21 countries around the world. One of the things that has me interested about AMT‚Äôs business model is that they can use a single cell tower to provide service for all three major carriers (and have the capacity to support up to 5 networks), which creates huge margins for each tower.

**Valuation**

Over the last year, the share price has fallen from a peak of 260 last summer/fall to around 240. This puts the Price to FFO (P/E for REITs) to around 26, which is about where it usually trades. I expect AMT to trade in the 25-30 P/FFO range as investors realize the long-term growth runway in front of the company, so there might be some multiple expansion left. I expect that the continued growth of earnings and dividends will lead to a significant increase in share price over the next couple years and beyond.

**Dividend Growth**

I know that most people here aren‚Äôt looking for dividends, but it is still worth seeing how fast AMT‚Äôs dividend has grown. From 2013, the dividend has grown nearly 5x. Again, I get that no one here could give a shit about dividends, but everything else being equal, rising dividends lead to a rising share price. I don‚Äôt think we will see the same rapid growth as the last eight years, but I do think AMT will continue to grow the dividend at a decent pace over the next decade.

Short version: Dividends = free tendies. Dividend increases = more free tendies for shareholders.

**Footprint and Competitors**

AMT has a presence on 6 continents, and they continue to grow naturally and through acquisitions. This January they acquired Telxius Towers, which greatly expands their footprint in Europe and Latin America. Post-acquisition, the company said the revenue split will be approximately 51% North America, 10% Europe, 14% Africa, 15% South America, and 10% Asia Pacific.

Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) are the only public competitors of note, but American Tower is bigger and has a larger international presence. You can look into both, but AMT is the best way to get international exposure to 5G.

**Customer Concentration and New Edge Data Centers**

The US telecommunications companies make up about half of AMT‚Äôs revenue, so there is some revenue concentration. The demand for data and cell reception is pretty inelastic though, so no matter what happens to AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile, AMT will continue to thrive. The cell tower market isn‚Äôt exactly a monopoly, but because one tower can serve the whole industry, competitors like CCI and SBAC aren‚Äôt likely to build new towers in the same locations as American Tower‚Äôs existing towers (and vice versa).

They also recently opened six edge data centers (think Fastly or Cloudflare) to keep up with new and improving technology. This is just the beginning, but for a firm that has the resources of AMT, they could choose to expand rapidly if management likes the opportunity.

**Conclusion**

I work at one of the Big 4 Accounting Firms, so I have a pretty good idea of what businesses are worth investing in and which ones to leave for the smooth brained apes around here. American Tower has the management, growth mindset, and secular tailwinds of 5G that will continue to drive market beating shareholder returns.

I have put about 10% of my Roth IRA into AMT and I spent my whole stimulus check on a couple of Jan2023 300 calls a couple weeks ago. I think AMT is somewhere close to fairly priced currently, but the growth and business model mean that buying at today's prices could look like a bargain in a couple years.

I know that a lot of people are going to keep speculating on GameStop, but eventually that will come to an end. If you guys are fine buying companies that lose shitloads of money and have to issue new shares just to stay afloat, that‚Äôs fine, but I prefer to buy pieces of businesses that are profitable. Either way, good luck out there fellas.

I took profits at around the $18 mark in late January but held onto 3000 shares with hopes things will do better for the long term.

4/19/21 07:39,"CLOV DD - No Bullshit CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO‚Äôs class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are ‚Äúnon-tradeable‚Äù and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn‚Äôt have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the ""Hindenberg said this‚Äù and ‚ÄúS3 said this‚Äù bullshit that people have been arguing about...

But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS

Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here‚Äôs why:

The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \~30M short volume on 4/8 and \~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don‚Äôt know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.

https://preview.redd.it/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d

The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it‚Äôs without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let‚Äôs get into the shit that really matters.

First off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)

https://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e

* MACD bullish
* RSI only starting to warm up
* Decent support built between $7-$7.30
* But what‚Äôs really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.

**Now let‚Äôs get into call volume**

[Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)

Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

Next, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:

* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS
* Hindenberg short report
* Short seller price manipulation

The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.

Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: ‚ÄúClover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)‚Äù

Well, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.

It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn‚Äôt hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.

**Wrapping this up**

Now say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC‚Äôs were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.

&#x200B;

No one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don‚Äôt, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.

$CLOV to $100

&#x200B;

EDIT: anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME, it's not. Holding GME, love the setup going into this week.

Also: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah

And for those asking about my position. I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance.

&#x200B;

**Update 4/20:** people asking if they should sell. You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you.

Nothing has changed. The market dumped and people sold. If there's not enough buying pressure selling can take over. Doesn't mean buyers won't take back control.

Long term, my opinion is that anything under $15 is a buy. Dips are opportunities. Not worried.

I know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and ""day-and-date,"" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks.

***1)  ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to Top Box Office Again***

It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released.

***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***

With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal & AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies ""Cruella"" and ""Black Widow"" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's ""Mortal Kombat"" will be out on April 16.

***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***

Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film‚Äôs overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, ‚Äú[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)‚Äù already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan‚Äôs puzzling sci-fi thriller ‚ÄúTenet,‚Äù which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.

***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***

In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March. Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúRaya and the Last Dragon‚Äù is projected to take the weekend‚Äôs top spot, while Roadside Attraction‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Courier‚Äù are other notable new films releasing this weekend. (Source: Bloomberg 4/17/21)

***5) Wall Street ""Hate-Love"" Relationship***

Wall Street analysts absolutely HATED the stock in 2020. From May 2020 to March 2021 there wasn't a single BUY rating. B. Riley analyst Eric Wold was the FIRST to put a BUY rating on AMC since the pandemic. On Friday he said that the CEO‚Äôs comments on the share authorization should be interpreted as good news on AMC‚Äôs cash position for the year.

On Wednesday, Aron told YouTube host Trey Collins in an interview on ‚ÄúTrey‚Äôs Trades‚Äù: ‚ÄúWe hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.‚Äù

Aron also said AMC still has authorization to issue 43 million shares ‚Äúthat we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that‚Äôs a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven‚Äôt made any decisions yet.‚Äù Excerpts of the interview were [disclosed in a securities filing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921050489/tm2113075d1_defa14a.htm)dated Thursday.

Over the past year Wall Street analysts still keeps a fairly high rating on the stock,

***5) AMC Lightens Up Debt Like GME***

Like all companies, going into the pandemic highly levered (with tons of debt) wasn't a good idea, which is not surprising that so many hedge funds went after GME and AMC. GME recently announced that they are going to be debt free and AMC also lightened up their load this year when various PE firms like Silver Lake and Mudrick coverted their convertible notes into equity.

[AMC's debt in coming years is low and at a very low interest rate \(sub 3&#37;\), with the majority of its callable debt maturing in 2026. The company is now generating cash flow again which will easily have plenty of runway to get them through 2021 and to 2026. They should have no liquidity issues this year so as long as theatres continue to re-open. \(Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21\)](https://preview.redd.it/o6kgwc4f9ut61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b8df16a0de21a46980107df20eeb7e1e4df7387)

***6) SHORT INTEREST BACK UP***

Almost at 100% utilization, and 93.92MM shares short interest, next week will be interesting. Borrowing rates have also jumped back up this week. For those who are hoping for a gamma squeeze or short squeeze, I'm sure there are tons of you already reading other DDs and watching YouTube videos so I don't need to explain here. We're all here to make money. I'll be honest, I did a YOLO bet using AMC Call Options on the first pump up to $20 in late Jan and paperhanded and took gainz on the ride up. Now that the stock has pulled back to a decent level, this time I'm using shares, as there is just way too much market manipulation going on in the weekly options expirations with the market makers. This week, I saw tons of tutes coming in buying big blocks (100,000 to 1,000,000 share blocks) of AMC throughout the week, and I started accumulating from the high $8 range. Will continue to watch the MaxPain and options activity in coming days and weeks and play the trading range in addition to HOLDing shares.

4/16/21 19:24,"AMC are playing both the short and the long term game and praise the retal investors. Duh, not a financial advisor.

I loved every word of the interview with Adam Aron. He seems to be watching the market volume closely and plan his actions accordingly.

Quote from the article:

*""the movie-theater chain is once again ‚Äúunder attack‚Äù from short sellers after skirting bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.*  *The volume of short sales ‚Äî bets that the stock will go down ‚Äî rose about 50% in March to 73.8 million shares* *""*

Now, I'm not a market guru but I still believe that AMC are severely undervalued and heavily shorted. Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.

If anything, they are on route to become winners after the pandemic since the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific theatres have announced plans to close permanently.

*""Other theaters have succumbed to the Covid-19-struggle. ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres, two jointly owned California movie-theater chains, announced plans this week to close permanently, underscoring the still-tenuous state of the industry.""* 

The heavily discussed topic about the announcement to vote for the right to sell 500 million shares, which lead to significant price drop and short selling activity, has also been discussed by Adam Aron. The response:

*""If investors at the May 4 annual meeting approve the plan for additional stock, he‚Äôll gain flexibility to buy back debt at a discount or acquire another chain at an attractive price, which would counteract any dilution.""*

And more importantly:

*""Aron, who has long been known as outspoken, also praised the internet investors who see themselves as fighting against ‚Äúconventional‚Äù market participants, like short sellers who profit when stock prices decline. He connected with Collins, who offers online investment commentary under the username Trey‚Äôs Trades, after his 30-year-old son saw a tweet that Collins had sent to his nearly 50,000 followers, known as ‚Äúapes.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMy hat‚Äôs off to you,‚Äù Aron said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm well aware that you have been talking about AMC a lot over the last few months and you have, you know, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, tens and tens of thousands of people watching your shows on the YouTube channel,‚Äù Aron said.*

*‚ÄúI actually work for you,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand for that reason it‚Äôs a special reason for me to engage with all of you.‚Äù*

Read the last paragraph again. He works for us. So is every CEO on this goddamn planet that you guys have stocks in and hold long term. But he is the one who publicly acknowledged it. 

In summary:

1. Adam Aron acknowledged the rising activity in short selling which influences the price. 
2. He acknowledges the debt so he is acting accordingly.
3. Competition (at least on the west coast) reduced.
4. He works for the ""apes"".
5. No plans to immediately sell the 500 million shares they announced. If things get tough, they have the right to sell 43 million shares to cover debt which means bankruptcy is NOT on the cards.

It was a tough year for the theatre giant but CEO Adam Aron believes in a bright future. It was a one in a generation economic and health crisis but AMC survived. The only way to go is UP.

4/16/21 01:35,"AMC Discussion Recently, I've diversified my portfolio and put it all in AMC. Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons:

1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down
2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&P have only moved up 2.3% respectively.
3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.

Alright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.

P.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock.

Edit: So a lot of people have been talking about the pandemic and how watching movies at home is the thing now, so I just to point out 3 things:

1. AMC at some point may shift their marketing strategy so we should dismiss it's growth off the the way it is operating now.
2. Also, watching movies at home is not the same as at a theater, the screen is not as bigger  and the experience as a whole is different. (Think imax and 3d stuff). Plus, people have been binge watching netflix the whole pandemic, by now they are probably ready for a change. 
3. Lastly, when it comes to the pandemic, people are getting vaccinated and they are getting more used to social distancing and masks. The point is not that people will cram back into theaters. They will come back with safety measures (social distancing, masks, etc ) and more importantly, they will feel safe and comfortable with this new normal.

4/15/21 23:56,"AMC filed with the SEC its promise not to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized in 2021 - but what does this really mean? TLDR at the bottom. 

The CEO of AMC has publicly promised yesterday to submit in writing with the SEC that AMC does not plan to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized by shareholders in May. 

Happy to report that as of this morning AMC filed [Statement 14A](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e5d2e721-c60b-4f74-9f90-7e970a8fc426.html) reiterating exactly what AA said in the interview: 

 
>**Adam Aron**: We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can‚Äôt announce intentions and then not carry through it, we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.
 
>. . .
 
>**Adam Aron**: If we need to raise some cash in the short term, remember we already have 43 million shares that are out there that were authorized in the year 2013 that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that‚Äôs a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven‚Äôt made any decisions yet.

This is a cause for cautious celebration - the CEO stands by his statement, and is serious about keeping the promise. 

But, the emphasis is on cautious. First rule of sound investing - read the fine print. That‚Äôs how they screw you. 


>Should one or more of these risks, trends, uncertainties or facts [listed above] materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained herein. **Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.** Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.

Let me unpack this for you. **AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen  they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.**. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can‚Äôt pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don‚Äôt want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares. 

**STAY DILIGENT AND DO WHATS BEST FOR YOUR WALLET**

Seen many people switch to an automatic ‚Äúyes‚Äù on their vote. I won‚Äôt be one of those people. 

I‚Äôm not an advisor or your advisor, financial or otherwise. I‚Äôm just a guy with thousands of AMC shares who likes to read the fine print and make weighted decisions based on facts. 

Full disclosure - I sold a third of my April 2019 shares in January to recoup basis and take profits. The rest is in for the ride as it‚Äôs all pure profit, so naturally I want it to go as high as possible.

TLDR: good news the CEO stood by his promise. Bad news they can still issue more shares if the situation gets worse this year. My ‚Äúno‚Äù vote stands.",45134,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999794662,True

Viacom's audience reach is very broad, as their content is vast and appeals to all kinds of demographics. Let's talk about just Paramount Plus alone for.

* National Women's Soccer League
* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League --¬†*Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.*

In addition, Paramount+ is expanding its exclusive English-language rights in the U.S. with three more soccer properties, featuring hundreds of additional matches.

* Concacaf -- offering more than 200 Concacaf matches, starting with the Concacaf Nations League Finals in June of this year, which will feature the U.S. Men's National Team. Coverage will feature all 41 national teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean across different competitions, including the qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, which will feature the defending champion U.S. Women's National Team.
* Liga Profesional de Futbol -- Paramount+ will stream more than 300 matches a year from Argentina's top soccer division.
* Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A -- Paramount+ will stream more than 360 matches a year from Brazil's premier soccer league.

The service will also be the exclusive home of a long-running, original series¬†***Inside the NFL***. And knowing fans don't stop watching when the players stop playing, Paramount+ will feature CBS Sports HQ.

This is a no brainer. Sports brings in YUUUUUGE revenue and viewership and P+ will have many different kinds of sports that appeal to all kinds of viewers across the globe. Soccer is literally the most popular and watched sport in the world. Honestly from the sports side, all P+ is missing is Cricket. March Madness alone has broken revenue records and the month isn't even over!!!!! Even if corona were to shut it down, VIAC has already gotten more profit than they anticipated, any additional profit are just more blessings!

P+ will also have a bunch of original content coming in the next coming years. Here you can find a list of content coming to P+. [https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/](https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/)

The one that caught my interest the most was Halo. I remember I bought the Xbox console SOLEY for that game alone, along with millions of other fans. I suspect this alone would bring a lot of attention when released to P+.

ViacomCBS also has A LOT of their content licensed out to other companies such as Amazon and Netflix. ""Coming to America 2"" was made by Paramount Studios yet is streaming on Amazon. Why? Because of the shit ton of revenue it brings them.

""When Disney began developing Disney+, it reclaimed every last piece of programming it had licensed to Netflix (though Disney films released between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2018 may return to Netflix in 2026). In doing so, the Mouse House sacrificed hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative licensing revenue in order to build an exclusive in-house library. Yet Paramount Pictures spent 2020 selling off most of its theatrical features to rival streamers while Paramount Network licensed cable‚Äôs biggest hit (Yellowstone) exclusively to Peacock. Why? Because ViacomCBS President & CEO of Streaming Tom Ryan believes strategic licensing can be a boom for Paramount+ long-term even if it costs the streamer exclusive access."" See: [https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/](https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/)

Netflix has gotten significant attention for its massive spending on content. Over the last year, the company's spending on content topped $14.6 billion. ViacomCBS suggested it spent about $13 billion last year on content. It's no secret that spending on content seems to drive streaming revenue. However, some are speculating the company's recently announced $2.5 billion debt offering could be an act of desperation. There is little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic represents a significant challenge, yet ViacomCBS seems to be positioned better than some of its peers.

For those worried about closed movie theaters, last quarter the company's theatrical revenue equaled just under 2% of total revenue. It's true that advertising makes up the bulk of the company's revenue, yet the company's consistent high-quality content should continue to attract ad dollars. When people are stuck at home, it's likely they are going to watch more video. Whether that means Pluto TV, the traditional CBS, Showtime, or CBS All Access, the company should be able to grow its audience. As the public health crisis eventually fades, the returning ad dollars, combined with a bigger audience, should serve investors and the company well.

As proof that streaming seems to be the future of ViacomCBS, the company's subscription and video advertising business is expected to grow by 35% to 40%. ViacomCBS has multiple offerings driving its streaming business. The company's Pluto TV service increased its monthly active users in the U.S. by 75% annually. Paid streaming subscriptions increased by 50% year over year domestically. On the flip side, Netflix is witnessing a split in its membership growth. On the domestic side of the house, Netflix's paid memberships increased by a pedestrian 4.4% annually. International has become the company's growth engine, with paid memberships increasing by more than 31% year over year.

Though both ViacomCBS and Netflix are reporting solid growth in subscribers, the former generates significant free cash flow. In the past 12 months, ViacomCBS generated core free cash flow (FCF) of over $3.4 billion.

The coronavirus may challenge ViacomCBS' short-term results and cause volatility. However, with a yield of nearly 6%¬†an almost comically low payout ratio, and a growing streaming business, this represents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Don't forget Netflix is also cracking down on password sharing. As far as I know, P+ can be shared and streamed on multiple devices at once. I am always streaming my P+ on my computer 24/7 and can watch a soccer match from my mobile device at the same time. Also, P+ doesn't ask me if I am ""still watching"" like Netflix does after some time.

ViacomCBS also owns Paramount Pictures, a movie studio that has produced so much great content over the years. Last time I checked, movie theaters are PACKED and movie revenue will continue to explode as we get closer to the summer and as we get more people vaccinated.

Another interesting thing regarding ViacomCBS is that is currently trading with a P/E ratio of 24.22, much lower than Netflix(85.21), yet Netflix doesn't offer live sports or news and does not generate cable revenue. ViacomCBS is still undervalued and has a lot of room for growth. As of now, the public float of shares is around 543 million shares, while the amount of shares shorted on VIAC is about 19.36% (around 105 million shares). Along with that, there is high institutional ownership of shares (currently 93.86%, see: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional)) and is very possible that an there potential an activist investor has been buying up shares since August of last year. (see:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge))

Institutional money has some of the BIGGEST diamond hands ever and they are seemingly continuing to buy up shares and hold, another reason you continue to see VIAC have a strong, daily uptrend. With such high institutional ownership and very low insider ownership (0.2% of total float), that leaves about 6% of shares left available (543 million shares).

see:[http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/](http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/)

Viacom operates a largely decentralized business model. It gets almost 80% of its revenues through a collection of network channels that include MTV, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TV Land, CMT, BET, and Spike. The rest of its revenues come from Paramount Pictures (film) and Harmonix (video games).

Those subsidiaries have their own management teams that are silo-ed off to act in their own self interest. Even when Sumner Redstone was in his physical prime and applied a micro-managing spirit to his holdings, he wasn‚Äôt make individual business decisions‚Äìhe was firing the managers of his subsidiaries for not meeting his short-term expectations. This isn‚Äôt Steve Jobs orchestrating the iPhone; Sumner Redstone did not bring you SpongeBob.

While most Viacom shareholders are understandably paying attention to the public spat over board control, that is not the issue that would keep me up at night if I were a long-term shareholder. Considering that 80% of revenues come from network channels, my predominant focus would be: How many minutes are being delivered per month by the channels we own?

We‚Äôve had four nasty recessions in the past century. These are illustrative for helping us figure out the durability of a company‚Äôs profits during times of deep distress and aid us in quantifying the harm posed by perceived risks. In the case of Viacom, it actually grew profits from $2.38 per share in 2008 to $2.56 per share in 2009. Profits went from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion even as minutes distributed through the network channels declined by 5%. Advertising rates plummeted, and minutes watched declined by a little bit, and yet the media giant still churned out more cash.

Viacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings. It has repurchased 35% of its stock since 2010, taking the share count down from 608 million to 390 million. Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Profits have declined $200 million from $2.2 billion to $2.0 billion over the past five years. That also coincides with a significant period of buybacks so that earnings have actually grown from $3.78 per share in 2011 to somewhere in the low $5 range right now.

Put another way: Viacom the corporation has seen profits decline by 1.89% per year over the last five years, while Viacom shareholders have seen their profits climb by 6.17% per year over the past five years.

Edit: good read and news, more income for VIAC - [https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs)

The Play:

I believe VIAC will see $175 or higher by EOY. I already have several calls at different strikes, but I plan on getting many more far OTM calls with 2023 expirations and plan on getting more shares. I believe anything after 4/16 expiration with $90-120 strikes would be a good call to look at.

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

\*EDIT: Although I still believe $175 EOY is possible, I think $150 is more likely and conservative. I can very much so see this stock at $200 in 2022. I have already gotten OTM LEAPS and will hold on to them like your wife holds her boyfriend at night. For shorter term calls, I would look at $52-$60 calls with at least 2-3 months to expiration, obviously more time is better. This week will be important, if the sell momentum has died down, the only other direction this stock can go is: UP!

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

Also I am anticipating YUGE sub growth in this year and next. Even if you hate their streaming service, I'm willing to be that you have watched at least 1 VIAC produced show or movie on any of the other stream services you do like and subscribe to. They are going to make money either from you directly subscribing or you watching their content on other services....\*cough\*coming to america 2\*cough\*....

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

I can imagine a scenario where others who like the stock also like and support the stream with a sub, and unlike other services like Netflix that stops streaming after some time asking you ""are you still watching"", Paramount Plus doesn't. I mean hey, I LOVE VIAC and I LOVE P+ so much that I just  
üëÅÔ∏èwatchüëÅÔ∏è shows 24/7. I would love to üëÅÔ∏èwatchüëÅÔ∏è all their content, although I do fall asleep at sometimes, but the shows and movies keep playing, so I NEVER MISS OUT. Even while at work, on my other computer I leave the shows üëÅÔ∏èplayingüëÅÔ∏è so I NEVER MISS ANYTHING. Could you imagine others loving the stock and company like I do, üëÅÔ∏èwatchingüëÅÔ∏è all their content NONSTOP? I could only imagine their upcoming üëÅÔ∏èearnings reportüëÅÔ∏è would be insane in that case, and would do wonders to my lovely stock... but again, I'm retarded so what the hell do I know right?

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

If you know, you know.... üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

Now I also believe there may be a great opportunity here for those who has been hurt or downed in the battle of GME and AMC, and there has been MANY. Look to VIAC as the healing spell that has been cast on the market. VIAC can rejuvenate your tendies, so you can have more ammo to fight against the hedgies! Should you choose let VIAC heal you, I suggest you leave some tendies with VIAC to continue to grow and multiply, just in case if you go back and goto the GME or AMC fight and get hurt or down in battle once again. That way you can return to the VIAC tendies you had left and didnt touch, which have now created tendie clones that you can use once again in the GME and AMC battle, should you choose to do so! For the battle of GME and AMC will be long and drawn out, you must be adequately prepared!!! TENDIES MAKES MORE TENDIES!!!!

VIAC is the water of life, it heals all those who are weary from battle! Use this power wisely, fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates!

As you can see, I started my stonk journey in February, and pretty much bought whatever looked good, at the time. First, I threw $10,000+ at GME on FEB 1 thinking, ""This can only go up! I'm gonna be sooo fuckin rich!!!"". It did not. Also bought a shit ton of AMC, thinking that ""if GME won't work, AMC will just pull a January GME, and send me to the moon. It did not. After that, I just bought whatever was up that day, thinking they would boost my amazing GME gains. Again, they did not. Last week I added ASO and VIAC to the dream team, hoping they would boost my portfolio, because they looked good. As you can see, they haven't helped much, as GME has been steadily tearing me apart since February. Oh, and I bought M, thanking that ""if retail is going up, it only makes sense that the biggest retail store in the world would moon, surprising even WSB, who wouldn't even see it coming. I was gonna be Macy's version of DFV. And, it has been going up most of the time, but it's not really helping me here, and has not mooned the way I thought it would.

4/30/21 23:21,"Quick TA DD on CLOV as of 4/29/21 Hello my fellow apes, I have been a long-time lurker of this sub ever since I joined, but today I have decided to bring you a TA DD as of 4/29/21 price action for CLOV.

As of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons:

* The market displayed a bearish sentiment in general against the medium/small/micro market caps while most of the large market caps was up (ex. FB) which explains why DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 were all up by EOD.
* MVIS crashing hard which caused a ripple effect of panic selling across popular stocks like CLOV, AMC, GME, and MNMD.

&#x200B;

[Daily chart of CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/byclt37gzaw61.png?width=3766&format=png&auto=webp&s=156907323ac0c10051c6051276d9d110e5c4640c)

**Fibonacci retracements:**

Looking at the chart above, Fibonacci retracements clearly show that we failed to cross over the 38.2% resistance level of $11.14 due to the reasons described from the previous paragraph. The 38.2% resistance level will be crucial heading into today's trading session (4/30/21) as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34.

If we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up.

&#x200B;

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more.

With wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon.

As for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off.

&#x200B;

**Other:**

* Golden cross pattern detected on the daily chart, highly bullish sentiment.
* RSI is centered out. Depending on today's (4/30) price action, we will find out if we are still in bullish sentiment or heading back to bearish sentiment based on RSI.
* Daily MACD chart is still looking bullish as MACD line is still above the signal line, reinforces the idea that we are still in the bullish phase.
* Triple bottom and we've bounced off every single time, another bullish sentiment.
* All around we are still seeing a lot of bullish indicators. Let's hope that yesterday's price action was a bear trap.

**Conclusion:**

All this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon.

**Tl;dr: We are going to the fucking moon, don't be scared of the setbacks and don't panic sell.**

Some takeaway from the interview:

‚ÄúSo big debut on the NASDAQ today, but I'm looking at the stock and it's down 26%. So take us through what's going in your mind right now?‚Äù

JR RAHN: Well, look, I think we had a massive run-up on Friday and also on Monday. This was a very hotly-anticipated listing by many of our shareholders. And so I think now that we are on NASDAQ, we're going to start to see a little bit of some stability here today. It seems to be re-tracing a bit. But you know, this isn't just about share price. This is really about-- NASDAQ is about, how do we allocate capital to mental health?

And how do we build an entire new industry? These are still very early innings for us. And so we're not going to be dictated by the day-to-day fluctuations or hour-by-hout fluctuations of our stock. We have 180,000 shareholders last time I checked, and a lot of them are very mission-driven. I think, yes, they are interested in investing into us for gains, but I think, importantly, a lot of them share what 40% of the US currently shares, which is that they have a form of mental illness or addiction at the moment.

And so this is not just about investing. This is about investing in a company that is going to have a large impact on society. And that really is our mission.

‚ÄúYou mentioned your investor base-- you've got some pretty passionate investors there. And I understand you're also trending on WallStreetBets today-- not quite sure if investors are seeing MindMed as one of those meme-type stocks like we saw with AMC and GameStop. But what's your take on what you're seeing happening sort of at the grassroots level with investors-- with individual investors and your company right now?‚Äù

JR RAHN: Well, these are chaotic times. And when you have chaotic times, both in the markets and in society, mental health is a big component and a problem that needs to be looked at. I think our being mentioned in WallStreetBets and on our MindMed investors club-- this is just a natural outcry from normal people that want to see a change in mental health. And suddenly, they can identify with something.

I think it's great. I love to have empowered and passionate shareholders. We're very, very receptive and supportive. And you know, I think there's been a lot of hype around WallStreetBets, and meme stocks, and all of these things. But at the end of the day, people make markets.

But yesterday, I've stayed late just to see maestro (cocaine snorting, hand waving bear-sucker, which is afraid of stocks with high short interest).  
He mentioned the ""mob of wsb"" I think like 10 times. Also said that degenerates made AMC and GME worth something and most probably made something from nothing. And seems like it's MVIS time.  
So I was wondering, being not a fan of JC - he started mentioning WSB actively just lately (after Jan GME rocket) or he is picking on WSB for quite some time?  
Also I think he wants to say, that he is harassed and doesn't like this. Who poked the bear again? Somebody posted something on his twitter again?

I love GME, and AMC, I will own them and continue to buy GME like a 401k till I die. However, MVIS (large position at 11 (gain)), CLOV (large position at 15 (loss)), BB, SPY PUTS (Margin Called More times than I like to admit), etc are just squeeze or yolo plays.

MNMD is something else, it not only presents possible endless tendies but fuck we could be looking at the new generation of treatment for depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, and many other mental health disorders. I had people in my life that I wish had the opportunity to experience this type of treatment. A treatment outside of conventional pharma or therapy, both of which I am a huge advocate for (please always seek help), but sometimes there is a different means. Something that could have helped the person who everyone said they ""tried everything"" for. I'm sick of hearing we tried everything when there is more. I hope we can continue to progress and alter our perception of how to treat the many different things that so many struggle with every day.

Even if the only thing this company produces is one new treatment at least it adds one more thing to the ""tried everything"" process, because it's one more thing that could have maybe helped him.",45628,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.992143869,True
4/28/21 11:42,"PROXY STATEMENT SUPPLEMENT FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON MAY 4, 2021 Huge news for AMC APES!!! The only questionable thing holding back the squeeze was the vote to allow AMC to create 500M new shares. The vote was planned for May 4 (May the Forth Be With Us Apes). CEO Aron later announced (and filed with SEC) that he would not create any of those shares in 2021! Huge news. Small spike.

People were still worried if they could trust him. Then TODAY, they just removed that final road block. They cancelled the request to add more shares. No move vote on adding shares... no dilution.

Silverback Adam Aron lured shorts and eviscerated them!!!

Nothing holding back AMC on market open tomorrow. The glass ceiling has now become a diamond floor for us to stand on and rocket upwards.

Therefore, I was very interested in hearing everything Gensler and crew had to say. For anyone who actually sat through that garbage, I feel for you as well. 

That scripted act put on for the public was an embarrassment. For the most part, they were served up softball questions easily hit out of the park. If you listened closely to what Gary Gensler said and the way he reacted when thrown the couple of hardballs to him, you‚Äôd have to know that he‚Äôs definitely not on the side of the little man investor. 

He leaned HEAVILY towards more regulation of investors on ‚ÄúAPPS‚Äù and social media, even though he said we do have a right to free speech unless it crossed certain thresholds. His answers to questions heavily leaned towards the larger firms. There was no serious indication that he would be cracking down on the RIDICULOUS naked shorting of the markets (which by the way NOBODY wanted to address, which in and of itself says it all).

Here‚Äôs the article: 

May 6, 2021 07:09 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Fintech

TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, E*Trade, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), and Webull collected $1.02 billion in payment for order flow in the first quarter of the year.
$436 million of these payments came from equity trades, while $587 million have been paid for options trades

The top two paying venues were Citadel Securities, with $445 million paid to the top 5 online brokerages, and Global Executions Brokers with $181 million.

The first quarter of 2021 saw a substantial spike in retail trading activities, mainly caused by various short squeezes in stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Entertainment Holding. Google trends show the peak in search volume for terms like GameStop, Short Squeeze, and Day Trading in the last week of January.

Especially the trading apps Robinhood and Webull saw a significant increase in app installs and new accounts. As a result, the payment for order flow income for Robinhood grew from $91 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $331 million in 2021. Webull had the most substantial percentage gain with $3 million in Q1/2020 to $46 million in Q1/2021.

The payment for order flow split by broker for the first quarter of 2021 reveals that TD Ameritrade received most payments, followed by Robinhood and E*Trade.

TD Ameritrade: $429 million
Robinhood: $331 million
E*Trade: $139 million

This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/q29ncm07m3y61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e400362006ce7ce4571361731cece094ba3b9d38)

GME is back at the top again this week. GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions. This can be reflected in the sentiment as well. AMC has experienced a continuous decline in discussion volume and now is in the 8th position. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/sdfgfdncm3y61.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc44dd645aa9f8fdba923805c7013156328d8b70

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. 

**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank. 

**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment. 

**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report. 

**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  

**SOME FAQ‚Äôs:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc).

5/20/21 00:40,"I promised memetron9000 to compile a textual TA after he re-approved my post with inverted MC Hammer and a bull dominating a bear. I am a man of my word, so here‚Äôs UWMC current state TA take. Unbiased, as all the things should be. Just a quick heads up, retards! We are getting famous! My yesterday‚Äôs AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

&#x200B;

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move.

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL:DR: My Thesis**

I think Netflix was secretly trying to drive these companies into the ground and hold their heads underwater with their hedgy henchmen. Their plan was within sight with the Lockdowns as both companies were hit hard. They were very close and slotted for BlockBusters fate until **we stepped in and fucked it up**. With everyone straped into their couches this last year binging tiger king how do you increase revenue? They've been trading sidways ever since. Now Netflix is fucked. The release of Cuties shot themselves in the foot (lost 800,000) viewers at such a competitive time in the streaming sector.

Karma's a bitch, just like my stepmom: Netflix has it coming, and that's why I'm not very tall and I hear they have hedges in between the Eiffel tower. *yeah you like that?*

I personally just don't like Netflix as a company, and for that ***I don't like the stock***

5/17/21 03:33,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company‚Äôs latest earnings report. Even though the company‚Äôs revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to ‚ÄúCookie Crisis‚Äù - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data ‚Äì through third-party ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk‚Äôs business model. ¬†

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%.¬†

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company‚Äôs earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it‚Äôs not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.¬†¬†

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO‚Äôs announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company‚Äôs share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst.¬†

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Citron Research (Andrew Left) came up with a lame short report yesterday after shorting it down 20% the prior day, only for it to blow up in his face &amp; the stock running +7% yesterday, leaving them miserably unable to cover the short. Citron Research desperately followed up with 2 more tweets intraday, but management immediately clapped back directly on twitter, and the stock rallied further. 

It‚Äôs interesting to note that 6x the daily average volume was traded on Wednesday, where it fell -20% despite an excellent earnings print. This could possibly be multiple hedge funds collabing behind this short.

Andrew Left said his firm will stop ‚Äúactivist short selling‚Äù after the GME blow up, only to go back on his words a few months later. What‚Äôs worse, he‚Äôs shorting a charitable public benefit corp in Lemonade Inc.

5/14/21 12:27,"Palantir, how to build a theoretically perfect business, the possible incoming golden age of America, and why you shouldn't feel stupid for buying the dip. by now you all should be sick to death of hearing about Palantir. shit stock, hype company, everyone knows this already. most of you barely understand what they do. some of you do understand, and root for the potential of the birth of yet another trillion dollar company, but that's not what I'm going to talk about. There is an aspect to all this that I have not yet seen discussed anywhere, and as soon as people figure it out, I suspect Palantir will see activity beyond anything anyone right now has predicted. 

Lets start by asking a question. If you had to create a company that was perfect in every way, that was untouchable by competition and greater than any company before it, one that would make google or amazon look like AMC by comparison, what would you need to do?

first it would need to be a monopoly. no question there right? but a monopoly of what? There are currently 2 options that fit best and are also realistically achievable. those to things are information and energy. both will always exist, they will always be in high demand, they will never go out of style, and whoever finds a way to gain absolute control over one or both will effectively become the most wealthy person ever. 100 thousand years from now when humanity has transcended existence and all material wants we will still need information and energy. Palantir is attempting to monopolize information and to better understand why this is such a big deal, lets see what it would take to monopolize energy. 

the first and surprisingly easiest step, would be to create a viable source of free or almost free energy that you would then sell, probably through monthly payments, to the entire world. miniature thorium reactors, or breakthroughs in fusion technology could potentially do this. There is more to be done however...

1. In order for your business to last for centuries, your device needs to be impossible to recreate by anybody except your business and those associated with it. 
2. it needs to be cheap, very cheap, and yet generate revenue regularly no matter the conditions or state of the world.
3. It needs to be constantly improved, or somehow protected from the possibility of someone creating an even better idea and putting your company out of business. 

assuming all these goals are met, you would now be the owner of a business that will always generate profit, that will always exist and bring value to customers, and that exists in a market that grows as humanity grows, meaning your potential is linked to the success and proliferation of humanity.  With no possible competition, you would be the creator of the most successful company to ever exist. 

How now,  could this be accomplished with information, and how far is Palantir from achieving these same goals? is their product impossible to recreate? is it cheap and consistent with revenue? Is it immune to any possibility of anyone catching up with something even better? 

Almost. not quite yet, but they are surprisingly close.

&#x200B;

1. can their product be recreated?

technically yes, but both Gotham and Foundry are seeing adoption by some very important organizations. Gotham is already joined at the hip with the United States government, and with continued proven effectiveness and Palantir's willingness to make deals with other countries, its pretty much guaranteed that Gotham will be seeing mass adoption into other countries as well. Like a really nice disease, eventually everyone aligned with the United States will use it. 

Foundry's the big fish here though. The real deal and the reason Palantir is on track with their goal of becoming the biggest software company in the world. That's not me saying that, they literally make that claim in their most recent earnings report. 

All businesses and people essentially have the same problem. Data is very valuable, probably one of the most inherently valuable things in existence. Don't believe me? take a look at your computer. data is just the transfer of information and a computer is simply a really big bundle of information and tricks to measure that information.  A whole bunch of transistors turn on and off and through a massive amount of clever engineering and abstraction, all that data of whether or not something's on or off, 1 or 0, gets turned into your afternoon midget porn.  this is an extreme example of how much value can be pulled from data no matter  how  unimportant or useless it may seem. 100 years ago nobody would have ever guessed that stringing a bunch of lights together and having them interact through rules determined by whether they are on or off would possibly lead to what we have today but here we are. 

Data has value. The problem that every business has is that they have all this data, but how exactly do you extract value from that? how do you extract the most value possible? everyone has their own solutions to these problems, but there is no unification to any of it. This is where Foundry comes in.

Data that the Country or Business or person owns gets fed into Foundry, and everyone using it can assign specific rules to this data. This is a drastic oversimplification, but you frankly don't need to know the gritty details because they don't really matter here.  All you need to know is that  this oversimplification applies to computers as well. Computers are a massive collection of data, governed by rules where the result and potential uses are completely controlled by the person using the computer. 

There are plenty of questions here, how it works exactly, how private it is, what the use cases look like, and you can do this research on your own. What's interesting here is that while this product can definitely be recreated, its much much harder then it sounds and the fact that IBM and AWS have already given up and simply partnered with Palantir rather than try and recreate this technology just goes to show just how hard it would be to make a better Foundry or Gotham.  However, assuming that everyone eventually starts using this tech, what would happen if something better came along? 

2. Is Palantir's product immune to new and disruptive competition? 

The answer here is yes and absolutely. the REALLY neat thing about Foundry is that it essentially creates a perpetually self improving system. People input data and assign rules, but that data never disappears and those rules never change or are forgotten unless overruled by other more complex rules. this means that ANY new data added to the system is used to further improve the system.  Again if you  want more details do the research because I'm trying to talk to children here. 

I've been talking about data a lot but I feel I should stress the fact that your idea of what data is or can be is likely underdeveloped. did you poo today? what color was it? how soft was it?  was it chunkey or smooth?  how long were you on the toilet?  can any of this info be used to determine what you ate? how healthy you are?  what time did you poo?  do you poo in cycles or does it come randomly? can any of this information help predict when you will poo again?  maybe knowing these things can help you poo even better and more comfortably? 

This is all Data.  All of it can be used, and all of it has value to be found.  everything you see, do, feel, and think is data.  The number of ways this data can be connected and utilized to better understand the world and yourself is potentially infinite.  Therefore, a company that is able to create a product that can monopolize this potential could possibly grow even larger then one based on energy.  a product that is perpetually self improving will never be outpaced by anything else ESPECUALLY if they get a head start which is exactly what Palantir has spent 17 years and billions of dollars of R&D on. 

3. Is Palantir's product cheap and guaranteed to be profitably no matter the state of the world? 

I think it goes without saying that Software is the best business to be successful in. This is Unfortunately where Palantir is at their weakest currently, but as stated in their earnings report, they are hell bent on focusing on growth over everything else.  First they bag huge companies with lotsa money, then medium ones, then small businesses, and finally everyday average people.  Assuming company's continue to sign contracts, there will one day be a turning point where Palantir goes from a WSB name to a household one.  you wont even notice it happen, it will just happen. As for profitability regardless of the state of the world, Covid has already proven that Palantir's services are in very high demand. 

&#x200B;

On top of ALL this, Palantir is exclusively aligned with United States interests. Imagine if every country in the world used Palantir to some extent, and all that added value and power was exclusively controlled by the United States. There is an even bigger discussion to be had on the current technological race between the USA and China over who will perfect AI first, and the role Palantir will play in all this. The conclusion here is that whoever does win in the end, they will essentially decide the direction the world takes and how people in that world will live. This situation is very similar to the race between the U.S and Germany over who could invent the atomic bomb. luckily for us there's a lot less hot fiery death and a lot more new world order overshadowing the old one through the always watchful eyes of artificial intelligence. Elon musk is damn right to be afraid of AI, and If I had to pick one country to take it all I would like it to be the USA. This means that investing in Palantir is almost like betting on the United states in this all for one game. Make no mistake there is a very very good chance that whether or not you care about Palantir, your life is going to be affected by them one way or another. 

The moral of the story is buy the fucking dip and don't be a pussy about it. when you believe in a company enough it doesn't matter how much it dips because unless Karp and friends die in a fireball of death after boarding a small private jet to their mansions in Hawaii for a night of  drug fueled indulgences, the future will always be bright. If you're unsure about Palantir still don't worry.  They aren't going anywhere and there will be many many many more catalysts to fomo into and lose 50% of your portfolio on.

As it stands, I think the cruise industry got hit the worst by covid, but I think its popular enough that it will be around long after the plague ends.  This stock was in the high 60$s in 2018, and down from some mishaps to the 50$s and high 40$s in 2019.   Its got good potential in a long run of doubling any investment, but that could be 3 to 5 years at the earliest.  For the short haul though, it has dipped back down to 25$\~ and could easily rebound as it has the past 3 months bouncing between 25$ and 30$

5/14/21 06:35,"$DGX suddenly a PRIME Short Squeeze candidate DD Congrats to those who have made some tendies following my previous $DGX DDs series over the past 3 months (see post history). Although the returns have already been excellent, I stumbled across some additional data over the past 48hrs that make $DGX Quest Diagnostics even more enticing. Astonishingly, short interest has TRIPLED recently. No, this isn't your 50%+ short **obvious** short squeeze play, but hear me out. This short interest is a suicide play that's flying under the radar.

* $DGX is a relatively low volume stock. Hence this tripling of short interest has resulted in a Days to Cover ratio of 8.6. For perspective (**not** to disparage these plays), Days to Cover is below 1 for both GME and AMC.
* 8.6 Days to Cover is ABSURDLY high for a safe blue chip stock with elite financials and tons of cash on hand. Again, for even more perspective, close competitor $LH Labcorp sits at 1.9.
* Now here's the icing on the cake. The cherry on top. The tug after the massage:
   * **93% of $DGX float is owned by institutions**. After recent buybacks, their float presently sits at 130m shares, 121m of which is owned by institutions.
      * Vanguard is the largest holder. Blackrock recently increased their large stake as well. Safe dividend stock = low churn from institutions. They hold.
   * $DGX recently approved $1.5 billion ASR (accelerated share repurchase), meaning they are GUARANTEED to repurchase nearly 10% of float by Q4: roughly 10 to 11 MILLION shares.

**Napkin crayon math:** Present float of 130m LESS low churn institutional holdings = ""Retail"" is playing with 10m shares. The ASR alone requires the repurchasing of 10 million shares. Now add in that short interest recently spiked to 11 million shares.

**Result (TL;DR):** Assuming institutions continue to mostly hold this safe dividend, blue chip stock with incredibly strong financials and a mountain of cash on hand, the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase alone would propel this stock upwards. Throw the massive short interest spike on top and $DGX can rocket. This is honestly one of the dumbest short positions I've ever come across in the market. It is a suicide mission with high risk, minimal reward ($130 is rock bottom floor for this stock). It's so irrational that when I first saw it 2 days ago, I assumed it was a typo. It's too large to simply be a hedge. See DDs for non short interest related analysis.

5/14/21 05:13,"An honest question with reasons below. Why is anyone supporting AMC? The effort to stick it to the hedge funds was a great cause especially for GME but WSB's purpose for AMC is one that allowed execs from AMC to take clear advantage of everyone on WSB. 

In February, AMC top executives took bonuses of $8.3 million (literally for carrying them through the pandemic, which is interesting because they shutdown operations and made near zero income. Zero! So exactly how did they carry the company through the pandemic?). Yet WSB comes along and catapults the stock value so now these clowns are worthy of million dollar bonuses? This is no different than the banks taking TARP $ in 2008-09 and were instructed by the Fed to loan $ out to consumers but instead paid massive bonuses to themselves. Doesn't any of this anger anyone? It does me, I'm seriously pissed. 

Don't believe me, check it out: 

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-entertainment-awards-ceo-adam-aron-3-75m-bonus 

Even worse, NOW executive compensation has exploded. When movie theaters closed in March 2020 as the coronavirus took hold, AMC‚Äôs top executives including Aron agreed to cut their cash salary by 15% and decrease other compensation over three years (which is noble) in exchange for stock that will only vest if the price doubles or triples. (Uh, that would be fair if they championed the turnaround in the stock, which they didn't do, WSB did). 

See how that worked out? WSB saved the company (which is great because going to the movies is practically a need in life along with food, shelter and clothing). But again, the executives had zero involvement with the performance of the stock, ZERO. WSB is what championed this turnaround making the executive compensation pathetic.  So now what? Sell? Hold or something else? Either way, why was this company supported from the beginning?

5/13/21 05:14,"How to make ""free"" money by lending out your AMC shares Right now, short sellers are willing to pay very high interest to short AMC stock.  You can track borrow costs at [iBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc).  If you lend your shares out to short sellers, you can get paid for holding AMC.  You can get paid like 10% annualized or more.

**Method A**:  If you use Interactive brokers, sign up for their ""yield enhancement program"".

**Method B**:  Lend your shares out through the options market.

Here's how you do method B.  Buy a call option and sell a put option at the same strike price.

For example, you can buy a June 16 $11 call for $1.70 and sell the $11 put for $2.38.  If AMC goes sideways (its current price is $10.41), you will lose $0.59 on the put option.  So, you are getting paid **$0.09** for holding AMC until June 16 (37 days).  No matter what the stock price does, you will be 9 cents ahead of just owning the stock directly.

If you don't hit the bid/ask spread and use limit orders to get your position, you can probably buy the call for slightly cheaper and sell the put for slightly cheaper.  So, that would let you make more than 9 cents per 100 shares... it's somewhere less than 18.5 cents.

The bid/ask for AMC and the options are:

AMC  $10.43 / $10.44  
$11 call  $1.67 / $1.70  
$11 put  $2.37 / $2.50

If you paid the midpoint price for everything, you'd make 18.5 cents.  Usually the market makers will cheat you so you lose money to transaction costs.

**Method C**:  Don't lend your shares out.  Just buy a deep in-the-money call option on AMC.  Deep in-the-money refers to strike prices lower than the current trading price.  If the strike price is really low, then the call option will be extremely similar to owning the stock.  For example, a $0 strike price would almost be the same as owning the stock (except for the borrowing costs reflected in the price of the options).  The problem with buying a really low strike price is that the spreads are wider --> your transaction costs are higher.

The $9 call has fairly low spreads because options under $3 get price in penny increments.

So let's say AMC is trading at 10.46/10.47 and the $9 call is trading at $2.46/$2.51.  If you buy the call and AMC goes sideways, then you lose $1.035 per 100 shares because the options premium on AMC is very expensive.  But if the stock goes to 0, then the options premium would be worth it because you lose $2.50 instead of $10.465.

==============

# Why some dirtbag investment professionals don't lend their shares out

Suppose that a lot of AMC shareholders moved all of their shares out of their margin account and into a cash account.  This would lower the supply of shares that can be lent out, potentially driving the borrowing costs to something ridiculous.  If the borrow costs are too high, short sellers will start covering their positions (e.g. buying the stock) because they don't want to lose money on their trade.  Sometimes they have no choice- if the broker cannot locate shares to borrow, the broker will force the client's account into covering the short position.  (The broker is legally obligated to do this because naked short selling is supposed to be illegal.)

What they try to do is market manipulation.  They buy lots of shares and put all of them into a cash account.  The rising stock price creates a short squeeze along with some potential forced covering from short sellers who cannot locate shares to borrow.  Market manipulation is illegal by the way.

But anyways, that's the only argument against lending out your shares.  So, you should probably take advantage of the free money.",47264,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999627352,True

One could argue that they may be buying these stocks to lend them as shorts, however I believe that may hold a significant percentage. They realize what is happening is in fact without exaggeration: 
Historic.

In a nutshell if the retail investor can spend hours on social media focused on AMC and spend their hard earned cash on billboard, planes, strong DD, creating YouTube stars, and gather international new fans

*well...as an investor you bet they can afford a 10$ movie ticket for a 60 foot screen watching a great film.*

You might need a drink and popcorn, perhaps tendies, either way you‚Äôll enjoy a different type of experience that you would have at home. Perhaps it‚Äôs a date or just something different to do. If the movie was epic, it becomes a memorable event ‚Äú ya I remember this movie, I saw it in theatres, in fact I was with ... ‚Äú


Even without a squeeze it is increasingly becoming apparent that AMC will generate revenue at increasing rates. In fact the passion of retail investors who for the first time ever own the majority of AMC, love this Company. 

Whoever tells you cinemas are dead does not understand that for the entirety of its history the cinema industry made more Ticket sales in this day and age then ever before . Take a look at the past 10 years of box office hits, they are record breaking compared to to its previous 100 years of history. 

It‚Äôs hard to bet against what is currently happening. In fact it‚Äôs never been done in the history of AMC or the stock market.

- new fans around the world 
- social media and the power of the internet 
- planes, billboard, receipts, celebrities, word of mouth, news, and it continues growing.

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

5/31/21 01:20,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find last weeks post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nj7tco/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!   

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/ke62zgv6o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=67333daccbb4aefc351eff62aad5e9d8b0f1d40b)

Overall, it was a good week for meme stocks in the market. It took a 176% rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week.  GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market. Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight. Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry. If a stock could run for President, it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Electric car makers are still continuing to generate interest following the launch of Ford‚Äôs F150 lightning. 

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**  

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kpnkug68o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88d4c286c7bf60e4e94cbf0ac3760cba0a90b35)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.

**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** 

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f64d87ae205fce62b2be427ecd81638af12b868)

No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company‚Äôs first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.

**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO‚Äôs and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.

**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.

**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don‚Äôt expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.

**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

5/30/21 12:14,"Why is no one talking about BBBY? I know everyone is all about AMC and GME right now and by all means I have nothing but love for the Apes putting up the fight. I paper handed my AMC shares literally right before this last jump like an idiot. I bring up BBBY because right now it has a higher short percentage of float than both AMC and GME.

According to Yahoo Finance as of 5/14/2021 the short percentage of float for each of these companies is:

GME - 29.34%
AMC - 21.13%
BBBY - 64.38%

BBBY also just announced a partnership with DoorDash to offer same day delivery. The stock jumped on this news. Additionally, BBBY is poised to benefit from restrictions being lifted as a reopening play.

Unfortunately, the analysts don‚Äôt have much consensus on the stock. BofA recommends it as a buy with a 12 month target of $38 in a report published on 5/28/2021. Morningstar recommends to hold with a target price of $22, but that report was on 4/21/2021. I suspect Morningstar will come out with an updated report in the near future. CFRA rates it as a sell with a target price of $16 in a report published on 5/29/2021. Seems pretty conservative given that the stock hasn‚Äôt been at that level since September of last year.

5/30/21 03:55,"AMC Volume Price Analysis   

Hey fellow traders. Today, l‚Äôll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It‚Äôs an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it‚Äôs one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don‚Äôt know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff‚Äôs law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day‚Äôs close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski‚Äôs work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day‚Äôs close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday‚Äôs price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff‚Äôs work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool‚Äôs errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I‚Äôve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

20$ 07/16C AMC

30$ 07/16C AMC

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski‚Äôs HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know. More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target.",47573,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.777378857,True
5/30/21 03:12,"Potential of Nano Dimension $NNDM 

Disclaimer 

This is my first shot at a DD since joining a year ago. Just as a disclaimer I‚Äôm kinda retarded and not an expert at financial advise. I also hold 70 shares so I‚Äôm definitely biased. 

What the hell is NNDM? 

Nano Dimension is technology company that specializes in 3D printing computer chips. The are aimed at disrupting the current method of computer chip manufacturing called PCB (Printed Circuit Board). 

Why should you care? 

As technology develops the need for more complex computer chips increases. Normal PCB fabrication is limited in is manufacturing capabilities. Nano Dimensions printers can print in 3D with multiple materials, allowing for better optimization of electronics. This has the ability to disrupt the ~$60 billion dollar PCB market. Also imagine having the capability of 3D printing chips in space without having to be resupplied every time you need electronics equipment. 

Not only does their product have the potential to be revolutionary but they manufacture and supply all the bulk materials for there product. So once a company buys their 3D printers they almost have to buy the consumables from NNDM. 2/3 of their revenue comes from the printer itself while the other 1/3 comes from support/consumables. 

They are buying up smaller nano printing companies and have secured almost all the competitive patents. One article said the next competition is 2-3 years behind NNDM 

What are the downsides? 

NNDM has been underperforming over the last year or so in its transition to mass market vendor. They are also struggling to gain a foothold in the PCB market right now. 

It‚Äôs also been a rollercoaster of a stock, I have seen massive gains and subsequent losses all with in a few months of each other. 

Conclusion 

This is not a stock to buy if you‚Äôre expecting instant gains with in a week or so. You invest in this company if you like the potential in their technology. I believe the stock right now at $7 a share is a steal because if they can optimize production for mass market I believe their stock could be $30+ in a few years.

5/30/21 02:21,"AMC & GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze What's going on y'all

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

I‚Äôm asking for a retard friend who saw his in the money AMC calls fucking ballon on today‚Äôs opening run up then fall to shit and expire worthless. 

(Some context) purchased 1 day calls options expiring on 5/28: 10 26$ calls 10 27$ calls 10 28$.
Note this was the retard‚Äôs first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking ü§ë tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run. At the height of AMC‚Äôs run at opening he was up over 500% until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run. 

What are your options risk and strategies to keep your P&L from going tits up?

5/28/21 15:45,"Genuine AMC question (related to any short squeeze) So this is something I can't figure out and I'd really appreciate it if someone helped me understand.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

5/28/21 14:12,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail) This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",47660,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999695778,True

5/27/21 12:00,"Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

5/27/21 10:30,"Cramer said‚Ä¶. CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Wednesday he‚Äôs not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
‚ÄúAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,‚Äù Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC ‚Äî which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming ‚Äî is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That‚Äôs compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt have unlimited firepower, but they‚Äôve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.‚Äù

5/27/21 06:34,"UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",47859,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999452174,True
5/27/21 04:31,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?  

[GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/7f0br59p2i171.jpg?width=2379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8235e35a004aee7fa7f74e591251a636aa2421ce)

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",48023,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.722599506,True

This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.¬†We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker‚Äôs Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it‚Äôs slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford‚Äôs CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ‚Äôs:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

6/13/21 00:03,"Why you should make a WISH I just WISH to highlight some facts from my own analysis on why I think WISH is worth a look. I used several criterias and detailed the methodology used for each one as well as the results. Enjoy the reading.

&#x200B;

**Analysts Opinion**

* *Methodology*: Comparing the price target of WISH as of today with some others meme names the day before they started rising (obviously those dates are subjective and my choice might differ from yours).
* *Results:*
   * The average price target (PT) for WISH is 18.4 (+84%) whereas meme stocks had averages below (GME, AMC) or close (BB, CLOV) to their respective PT
   * WISH is the only stock where even the most pessimistic analyst has a PT above current price ($12 / +20%) and 0 sell recommendation
   * Majority of analysts are positive on the stock (81.8%)

https://preview.redd.it/hz996cpiyt471.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=6900c69c7094e8b4a74c69d20a01da22e94077e1

**Fundamentals**

* *Methodology:* Comparing expected price-to-sales ratios, expected revenue CAGR and expected adjusted EBITDA margin based on analyst forecasts at end of 2023. Note that the selection of meme stocks is subjective and so are the resulting averages in the table below.
* *Results*: WISH has, by far, the smallest expected price-to-sales ratio although its expected revenue growth and EBITDA margin are only slightly below average

https://preview.redd.it/u5kfi4sazt471.png?width=261&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef1595e4859e2447b4232d66df85109b3a905cc7

**Short Interest**

* *Methodology:* Comparing the short interest as a % of float of WISH, as of today, with some other meme names before they started their rise (again: dates choice are subjective). Note that I only have access to short interest information updated twice per month; therefore I sued the closest date as a reference point.
* *Results:*
   * WISH has a short interest ratio close to BB when it became a meme stock
   * The lock-up period on WISH shares ended in May and its float increased from 60.6m to 376.5m shares. The ratio before the end of the lock-up was then around 45%

https://preview.redd.it/3gwtyvsxzt471.png?width=285&format=png&auto=webp&s=116d3a72acc56d8daa289d718795ea3f683b6d66

**Technical Analysis**

* *Methodology:* Using trend lines, resistances and exponential moving averages. Note that this is highly subjective.
* *Results*:
   * A major downtrend line has been broken recently, which led to a furious increase towards a strong resistance at 15. $15 used to be a support until beginning of April
   * The exponential moving average of 25 days used to act as a resistance and might now act as a support (Friday close just above it)
   * If the downtrend is indeed broken, this pulldown would be an interesting entry point

https://preview.redd.it/eg10o7kd3u471.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef3165832dcb31ea7fb7948bef5b90e08be9030

**Conclusion** *(personal and subjective)*

I believe that WISH has strong attributes to become a winning meme stock: 1) an under-valued price as suggested by analyst forecasts; 2) a high short interest ratio; 3) a potential entry point based on technical analysis

The Chinese ‚Äòtesla‚Äô (I hate calling it that), has been working its way up from the low $30s and is now at $45 already a significant move. This is a critical point and in my opinion will continue to show bullish momentum. A golden cross of moving averages (4hr chart) is imminent but a hold of this key support level and consolidation at this point will mean a move up to the low 50s with the potential to move back up to the 60s.

6/12/21 20:32,"That Four-Letter Word in Your Vocabulary... Dear Apes and Autists, 

I want to talk about that four-letter word we all know and use frequently, whether it be consciously or subconsciously. RISK <-four letters; not the word you were thinking of right?

Fundamentally, risk is a life philosophy and how we each measure the potential for reward vs penalty. (blah, blah, google stuff, theory on decision analysis, statistics and practical examples)

Here's my simplified version:

**RISK: Four Tenets for A Four Letter Word**

1.  **Live another day**. (Lesson from wreck and cavern diving) Don't go in so deep you can't make it out when everything goes wrong. Same applies to depth and (lack of) diversity of investing plays. Someone asked in r/thetagang about what to do with 100 naked calls they sold that are now ITM. Others YOLO their tuition /rent /mortgage /savings /medicine money. Don't do this.

 [I‚Äôm dumb and feel so hopeless. Never SELL NAKED CALLS. My 100k loss turned into over 600K in minutes with AMC. I‚Äôm not even sure how I can recover from this. : thetagang (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/nqy5nk/im_dumb_and_feel_so_hopeless_never_sell_naked/) 

2.  **Have a Plan. (aka Exit Strategy)** (military maxims) ""Failure to Plan is to plan to fail."" ""A plan is a baseline for change."" This is about figuring out ahead of time what your personal exit points are. There was a guy one weekend on WSB holding options up 3000% and wondering if he should sell some.

3.  **Call it off when it's going wrong**. (diving, trail riding). This is not a life or death mission. If it's a bad day and things are going screwy, recognize it, and call it early, rather than late. Have a beer and talk about what might have been...Do not ""double down"". (Like I did when CLOV was being suppressed in May, but I was on hopium, so I bought more calls, and they all became worthless.)

4.  **Recognize how little you know.** (every sport, hobby, and pastime) The world is full of excited, happy hobbyists! People who know a lot about subject are experts and usually do it for a living. Experts can recognize the limits of their own knowledge, unusual situations, and unashamedly seek counsel from trusted peers. Hubris is a common character flaw in Greek tragedy plays. Be aware of your own limitations; there's no Deus Ex Machinas out here! Seek advice before you get into trouble!

There a bunch more I could have added, but I know there's some awesome experience and brainpower lurking on various subs (and yes, even here) who can add what the average investing hobbyist should look for under one of these four headings.

Recognize that you WILL make mistakes, and that the market can move in mysterious ways.  Have a plan to get above water.  And may your tendies be hot and crisp.

6/12/21 13:17,"Why $SENS makes sense sentimentally By now, you retards have likely seen that SENS has a solid short float (25.81%) and promising, long-term value.  If you haven't, just buy SENS.  Or don't... I don't really give a shit.  But please do one thing, though... Spare me the comments (and downvotes) that AMC and GME are the only true plays and/or that my account is new (been lurking Reddit without an account since most of you were a bunch of neckbeards).  As a Type 1 diabetic, I'm on some sentimental shit with SENS and why the shorts can get rekt. 


*  Diabetes is a serious, long-term condition with a major impact on the lives and well-being of around 500MM individuals globally
   *  This half a billion number is projected to increase by 25% in 2030 and 51% in 2045
* Diabetes is among the top 10 causes of death in adults, and it was estimated to have caused four million deaths globally in 2017 
* In 2019, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes -- 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose in 2012 

Here's the thing... Deaths and major complications caused by diabetes are 100% preventable with the right technology to help manage blood glucose levels.  Companies like SENS are literally saving lives with their technology.  I can personally say that continuous glucose monitoring significantly reduces the burden of living with diabetes and improves quality of life, and I'm grateful that diabetes technology has come so far. 

Even if you don't give a shit about the sentimental value of seeing SENS succeed, the market for its products is sizeable, given that this chronic illness affects nearly 500MM people. 

TLDR: Fuck Diabetes. Fuck the shorts. Buy $SENS.

The book ""What Works on Wallstreet"" analyzed 40 years of stock market data.  It determined that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  It also determined this was the most important ratio to use in valuing a stock.

I disclose I am short 120 shares of AMC, starting two days ago.

2019 their sales were 5.47 billion.  Now they are 1.24 billion

(1.24/5.47) x 47.8 = 10.84

So when things return to normal and their sales go back to normal, the price to sales would be 10.84  assuming the stock stayed flat.

This 10.84 is a high level.  This level of high price to sales is where Microsoft lives; at 12.1 currently.

6/12/21 02:57,"With Vaccine Rollout in NZ, and future plans for border re-opening in 2022-24 Hey fellow apes, first time posting after being introduced to you through GME (bought @ 300+ and when it dipped to $90, earned my chicken tenders to say the least)
As I know there is a lot of stocks from GME, AMC, Palantir, etc. catching a lot of interest, I want to bring you guys some information from doing some DD in New Zealand where I am currently living and why you should look to put some money aside as the bounce-back for airlines comes into play with vaccine roll-out and sequentially border re-opening, especially those that are more affordable, namely Air NZ, and Qantas, but not limited to.

As you may know when Countries ran full restricted lockdowns, air-travel via tourism and delivery of goods via air (not only) received a huge economic hit.
During the increase of cases leading up to the lockdown, there was a huge dip in stock price from Air NZ, Qantas, and namely Air Canada as well as Delta airlines for you guys in the US.  It all hit relatively at the same time between Feb 2020 - March 2020, when the pandemic spiked.

Some airlines especially larger economies such as Canada and US airlines stocks are recovering. In order, Air Canada @ Peak 47$ dropped to $12.41 and is currently @ 27. Delta (one of many US airlines) @ Peak ~60$ dropped to 22$ and is now @ 48$.

Similarly, Qantas (Australia) @ peak 6.50$ dropped to 2.36$ and is now 4.71$ (it was closer to 8$ @ peak but it dropped a bit before it fell off completely at the timestamps, so keeping things specific to the pandemic)

Finally, Air NZ @ peak $3.00, dropped to 80 ¬¢ and is back up to $1.63. Now I don't expect insane % increases the likes of what we see in e-commerce, and that of the diamond handed folk of WSB, but as the economy begins to recover over the next few years and Air travel for tourism and goods will return, expect the stock to return to normal (or increase as tourism will increase as borders re-open)

I have more DD from ministry of health vaccine roll-out plans (publicly available and being a health student am now able to receive my vaccine) that lets me know that the current turnaround to have everyone vaccinated with relation to achieving herd immunity, and previous vaccine data of other diseases let's me know that it will be a few years before a solid rebound occurs.

DD of publicly available GDP sources of our economy in the form of tourism and recognizing over-stock of perishables in wholesale, etc. That I can explain in another post.

DD of previous cases namely Oil and gas, traumatic events and a variety of others that plummeted stock prices that have recovered to-date.

Now I am not one to say it is good to be making money knowing it is because of the cost of lives lost that resulted in it. But I don't expect to be using this money on myself, you all have shown me what good can come from your donations, and I plan to do the same, or at least take care of my family.

Them being GMC, AMC, and CLOV.  The goal has always remained the same - getting a glorious ride down to Tendietown. The question becomes: what vehicle will take you there?

https://preview.redd.it/sdedudrktm471.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=0133522e11a119a16c9543fb4d83ee6a095b7fcb

Two of the stonks mentioned above are quite familiar, if not exhausted on WSB. Yes, yes, we all love GME & AMC but the newcomer of the group is the most tantalizing at this time. That's Mr. Clover Health. Currently, CLOV has the highest percentage of free float on loan (52%). Of all three of Ihor's top picks It is the most shorted large cap stock on the market. It also has the lowest share price due to not squeezing like we've seen with GME and AMC.

Now that my $50 per month (fuck you Ortex) has deduced that CLOV it's ripe for the picking, let's discuss why this big green banana hammock is much different than our previously mentioned WSB conquests. I'll roll through a few potential catalyst for Clover that could send the stock skyward resulting in an epic ""Get Shorty"" moment.

1. For one, GME and AMC were both burning through cash and on the rainbow road to gay bear bankruptcy when the suits decided to short them into oblivion. Clover Health is a bit of a different story. They had sales of $670M in 2020 and are guiding for $800-900M in 2021. They are sitting on close to $1B in cash. The primary difference is that they are a technology/growth company rather than a legacy company needing to restructure and take on debt to stay alive. That means no dilution. A rare case for such a heavily shorted stock.
2. **Russell 3000** At the close of June 25th Clover Health will be added to the Russell 3000. This means every ETF that tracks the fund will have to add shares of CLOV to their portfolio. This is enough of a catalyst to move any stonk. But it could create back breaking movement for the bears. [June Russell 3000 Additions](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf)
3. **Markets** CLOV operates in very few states right now. They have ridiculously small percentage of the Medicare spending pool which was estimated over $800B in 2020. They are scaling rapidly and onboarding in new states every quarter. They also inked a deal with America's largest employer - Wal Mart. [Bloomberg - WalMart Partners With Medicare Startup Clover](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/walmart-s-next-health-foray-is-medicare-plan-with-startup-clover)

They do this using the Clover assistant, which has a growing penetration rate among physicians  and aims to save the government lots of doll hairs. This will open more doors for CLOV.
5. **Medicare Expansion**  Sleepy Joe Biden would love to lower the Medicare age to 60. Why? I don't fucking know. Because more free healthcare is cool now I guess. [JoeBiden.com Health Insurance Plan](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/) This kind of policy would increase the total addressable market share immediately for a company like CLOV.
6. **Management Team/Stock Lockup:** The CEO, executives and investors have most of their interest in the company tied to the stock. The CEO does not receive a salary and insiders cannot sell until CLOV reaches an average share price of $30 for a 90 day period. We're not going to have a mass insider selloff ala' Palantir. **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board was a former CFO of Livongo/Teledoc while Chelsea Clinton is also a board member.** If we know anything about the Clinton's, it's that they get their money and have plenty of government influence.

So in a nutshell, you've got too many positive catalysts for all the suits on Wall Street to be betting against this future disruptor. Way too many, in my smooth brained opinion. They got caught with their pants down this week but the short position remains higher than ever. I think it's an undervalued stock with tremendous growth potential.

It's late now and I ate too many crayons today so I'm going to bed. I' am not a financial advisor but I do own own 14,000 shares of CLOV. Other more intelligible DD's can be found here, here, and here:

TL:DR CLOV is unequivocally the best in breed short candidate on the market today as it has a number of growth catalysts ahead. Unlike other options, it does not need more cash or a business restructuring to be successful. This thing is a kettle pot ready to explode. Consider boarding this train before it leaves the station.

6/11/21 23:34,"ü¶ç‚ù§Ô∏èü¶çI am now 100% confident that we are 6-8 MILLION APES owning the float of AMC by MULTIPLE TIMES!! Billions of naked shorts is the only way it all adds up. MOASS INCOMING, PREPARE FOR TAKE OFF! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåô AA tweeted yesterday that their average share calculation is made very simple. It is the shares outstanding divided by total number of shareholders. This includes institutions, insiders and shareholders abroad. Pay special attention to shareholders abroad, as I will explain this later. First we will look at the numbers.

\---> BREAK DOWN OF THE AVERAGE SHARE CALCULATION <---

501,780,240 Shares outstanding

/ 4,100,000 Shareholders eligible to vote

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

= 122 Shares in average for all shareholders using outstanding shares

This is what AA gave us and he rounded down to 120 shares in average for both institutions, insiders and retail investors. The number of institutions is 397 and insiders 35 and these are therefore negligible compared to the millions of retail investors, and thus they do not matter in the average share calculations.

We know officially that there was 103 millions reported shares borrowed and sold short May 28th. These shares all have new owners and could be added to the float being held.

501,780,240 Shares outstanding May 27th

\+ 102,300,000 Reported shorts May 27th

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

= 604,080,240 Shares officially held

Using this the average held shares can be calculated like this:

604,080,240 Shares officially held

/ 4,100,000 Shareholders eligible to vote

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

= 147 Shares in average for all shareholders using official reported shorts

So this is the absolute minimum of average held shares. In an ideal market with full transparency this would be the real number. Spoiler: It is NOT!

Now, let's go back in time and make the same calculation for another key date, the 11th of March.

450,160,000 Shares outstanding March 11th

/ 3,200,000 Shareholders eligible to vote

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

= 140 Shares in average for all shareholders using outstanding shares

450,160,000 Shares outstanding March 11th

\+ 49,310,000 Reported shorts as of March 31st

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

= 499,470,000 Shares officially held

Using this the average held shares as of 11th of March becomes

499,470,000 Shares officially held

/ 3,200,000 Shareholders eligible to vote

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

= 156 Shares in average for all shareholders using official reported shorts

So, using AA's official tweet an average ape held about 140 shares March 11th and 120 June 2nd. Using the officially reported shorts an average ape held 156 shares in Match and now they hold an average of 147.

AND THIS OF COURSE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I HAVE ONLY ADDED TO MY POSITION. I'M 100% CONFIDENT THAT APES HAVE ONLY ADDED TO THEIR POSITION. WE HAVE BOUGHT THE DIPS AND WE HAVE BOUGHT THE RIPS!

So we owned the float already in March and not just once. Now we own it even more. I have tippled down since then. I know others have too. I hold for you and you hold for me.

SO LIKE WE ALL KNOW: WE HAVE WON. WE WILL MOON. MOASS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!

If the number of shares were actually reported to AMC in the shareholder count, it would have at least included all the shorts (as a short creates a new share and it also has a buyer and therefore is an actual share held by a shareholder).

I 100% believe that AA and AMC is using the outstanding shares because they have been advised to by their lawyers and possibly SEC running an investigation. AA (like all of us) knows that the officially reported shorts is underreported and shorts are hidden in ITM calls, FTDs, naked shorts, synthetics etc. lets called them all phantom shares.

\--> BREAK DOWN OF THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDERS <--

AA has said that retail now own more than 80% of the shares. On May 4th AA said that retail owned 80% already on March 11th count. Since then we have grown by 28%.

Let's break down the 4,100,000 shareholders. A person living in the US and Canada count as 1 shareholder. But a person living abroad (like me) are mainly counted through proxy (we can not vote and our shares are stored all together at our broker), meaning that the 15.000 shareholders at my broker (Nordnet) only count as 1 shareholder. Also it means that the growth of 28% is only in the US.

4,100,00 Shareholders June 2nd

\- 3,200,000 Shareholders March 11th

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

= 900,000 More shareholders in the US and Canada

The US is as Borat would say ""The Greatest Country in the World"", but the majority of the Worlds population lives outside the US. I would not be surprised if there are 50% or 100% more shareholders living outside the US.

\--> ESTIMATE OF ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES <--

The polls made by Matt, Trey and more have given us an insight in the number of shares held as of 4th of May 2012. I can't remember what they were at the time of writing this and they have likely grown as most are using every salary to buy additional shares.

125 shares x 4 million HODLERS = 500 million shares (500 outstanding, 0 short, 0 naked shorts)

150 shares x 4 million HODLERS = 600 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 0 naked shorts)

150 shares x 6 million HODLERS = 900 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 300 naked shorts)

200 shares x 6 million HODLERS = 1200 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 600 naked shorts)

200 shares x 8 million HODLERS = 1600 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 1000 naked shorts)

300 shares x 8 million HODLERS = 2400 million shares (500 outstanding, 100 short, 1800 naked shorts)

I think we own AMC not one time, not two times, not three times, not four times....It's more and we own AMC like a lot!

TLDR;

The 4,1 million shareholders as of June 2nd includes institutions and insiders in the US, CANADA and mainly brokers abroad, not individuals abroad. There are easily 50% or 100% more apes owning shares in AMC. That is 6-8 million shareholders!!

The average of 120 shares held as of June 2nd would have been 140 shares as of March 11th. AA confirmed yesterday that he simply used the outstanding shares. Hereby he confirms that he is not counting synthetics or even legal shorts.

We are dumb money, but we are smart enough to understand that AMC cannot legally tell us this that Shitadel is STEALING as they say in TEXAS. There is an ongoing SEC investigation.

The numbers proves that almost nobody has sold since March. We are more apes than ever. We have added to their position through dips and rips. We owned AMC in March and we own AMC in June.

AMC is owned by apes multiple times. There must be billions of phantom shares for it all to add up. I'M MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER!

SO LIKE WE ALL KNOW: WE HAVE WON. WE WILL MOON. MOASS WILL BE SPECTACULAR. MOON I'LL SEE YOU SOON! HODL!

Not financial advice, I'm plain dumb and only an even dumber retard would not take this with a grain of salt on a banana! Do your own DD and challenge this.

6/11/21 20:23,"The Real Deep Value Play - $DIS Most of us grew up watching Disney movies. Disney brought us happiness when we were kids, and now Disney is going to bring us happiness tendies as adults. 

Here‚Äôs some stuff that Disney has:

* PARKS
* Star Wars
* Fox and Friends
* Marvel

It‚Äôs currently suffering from post-earnings dump and meme market, because revenue and Disney + subscriber numbers missed estimates. However, it‚Äôs still a very bullish company imo.

Bullish factors:

* Disney parks are chock-full of people right now, with people fully getting into the summer swing and trying to take advantage of the restrictions being lifted. Loki just dropped on Disney + and viewer numbers for its opening day have beat numbers for both WandaVision and TFATWS. 
* Multiple movies are scheduled for release this year, such as Black Widow and the Eternals, which will no doubt bring big money numbers in.
* Per IBKR, analysts have raised price targets with an average target of $207.32 (real), high of $230.00 (super real), and a low of $147.00 (fake). 
* Last earnings reported $15bn revenue, despite the lockdowns and virus fears. Compare that to its pre-COVID revenue number of $20bn in December 2019, back when Disney + was first getting started.
* Park attendance numbers are going to shoot up, movies are getting released, and Disney + is still raking in money. 
* What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs now charging people to watch new releases on Disney +, allowing it to keep a LOT more money than it used to with traditional theatres.
* Also, AMC apes flocking to theatres to support their favourite stock can only mean that it drives movie viewership numbers up üòâ.
* Once Disney acquires WB, we‚Äôll see $500 (we all know it's happening).

Risks:

* Clown market
* Second/third/fourth wave

Positions:

* October 180c

First off, this is not professional financial advice‚Ä¶invest at your own peril. 

It‚Äôs been a crazy week for meme stocks. Congrats to everyone on whatever gains you might have. My condolences to those with large bags.

This week I‚Äôll give the sector overview (obviously), but also throw some memes in there. Additionally, I want to take a quick look at the RRG of the steel industry stocks b/c I‚Äôm balls deep in CLF at the moment.

[CLNE, BB, SNDL, AMC, WKHS, TLRY, GME, & CLOV had some nice runs this week. But it looks like CLNE \(#cowfarts\) still has the most steal from a momentum standpoint.

**Discussion:**

The graphs I‚Äôve shown above should be used as a data point when making your own decisions. I typicall use these graphs to identify companies, then 1) I do my own DD, and 2) check other posted DD before legging into my positions.

**What‚Äôs a good bet in the short term?**

Pretty much anything steel. Earning are coming up and steel prices are high. There‚Äôs a lot of other stuff that goes into it though. Here is some great DD by u/cheapballpointpen :

https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/nwc9zw/welcome\_to\_the\_steel\_jungle/

CLNE also looks good once it dies down a tad. Considering opening some CSPs. Made some solid coin with calls on the run-up.

**What‚Äôs a good bet in the long term?**

XLRE is on a fairly strong trajectory. Same with XLE. Most of my bets are short term though (i.e. less than 3 months).

In general the SPY is performing decently well, albeit flat. I have a few LEAPs for June and Sept of 2022.

**Honorable Mention:**

I‚Äôve been in ET for a while, and did a DD on it a while back and it‚Äôs been performing great. Recently though it‚Äôs been on a steady tear. Can‚Äôt wait for earnings, I expect a large decrease in debt with a lot of cash on hand.

6/11/21 08:45,"It's time to Short Squeeze Spy Lately, the DD around here is to short squeeze anything and everything, since DD exclusively means short squeeze. We've missed out on the best short squeeze target of all - SPY. The time is now to SHORT SQUEEZE SPY üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Here's how:**

First you find a thing people know, so it has meme potential and you don‚Äôt have to build brand recognition. This is actually more important than if anyone has shorted it. SPY has high name recognition because it refers to the James Bond movie series, which everyone has seen.

Then you declare a ‚Äòshort squeeze‚Äô is possible. Again, it doesn't matter how much it's been shorted. I already declared that a SPY short squeeze is possible. So we are good here.

Lastly‚Ä¶ You ‚Äòshort squeeze‚Äô (*By buying tons of call options, which is actually a delta squeeze and then a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze SHHHHH*).

You may be thinking‚Ä¶ what could be more idiotic that short squeezing the entire market? Is there a faster way to lose money? Didn't the SoftBank guy basically do this over the summer and lose $3 billion? The answers are of course ‚Äònothing‚Äô, 'no' and 'yes'.

**But those thoughts don‚Äôt serve up confirmatory bias. So instead, here‚Äôs a list of things that may help you with confirmatory bias:**

1. Tendies
2. It‚Äôs actually the SPDR, or Spider, S&P 500 ETF Trust. Spiders are vicious ambush predators, the type that would trap and feast upon the tendies of a hedge fund manager if they could.
3. Citadel Securities, Melvin Capital, and ‚ÄúThe Hedge Funds‚Äù have surely shorted this at some point, and I hear they aren‚Äôt so popular around here.
4. The short interest is 16%. That may not sound like a lot, but if 21% was good enough for AMC, surely 16% is close enough. More importantly, that is 362 BILLION DOLLARS of shares short. Even at its highest points, GME had something like 15 or 20 billion dollars short and the shorts had no choice but to cover. Even Stevie Cohen and Citadel can‚Äôt bail a bunch of hedge funds out of 362 billion dollars in an epic short squeeze of SPY! It would take a fed intervention, and they never do stuff like that.

But it gets even better! S&P 500 futures trade in arbitrage (fancy word for ‚Äòsame way) against SPY, and there are currently bout 2.8 million of those outstanding. Each one is $210k, so this is another $588 billion dollars of exposure‚Ä¶ and because each one technically has a long end and a short counterparty, it is in a way 100% short. Wow!

AND IT GETS EVEN BETTER. Because this ETF contains all companies of the index, you ALSO get to squeeze any shorts inside of that! You literately will be able to squeeze a good part of all shorts globally. That'll really show them!

Here's visual DD to help those who are illiterate but can still trade derivatives contracts. The rest of you are craving it too:

**Risks:**

Aside from the fact that this is an incredibly stupid idea that you should not try to do under any circumstances, I am aware of a few risks:

1. The hedgies will play dirty and do what is called a ‚Äòshort ladder‚Äô attack. This consists of them going to home depot, buying a foot ladder, and swinging it in a low motion at your shins. It also makes your stock prices go down. I recommend buying cowboy boots to defend against this.
2. The hedgies also can do 'naked shorting'. This is when they take off their clothes and dump ES futures which banks will buy and then hedge by dumping SPY. The countermeasure to this is to put sharks in their pool, since they usually do this while at their mansion in Florida, and swim afterwards, since they already took their clothes off. Paul Tudor Jones used to trade SPUs (big sized version of ES) while drinking, so I assume modern hedge fund managers are the same, so they won't notice the shark because they are tipsy, and will end up margin called since they won't be able to manually close their trade.
3. You guys will get distracted by a struggling retailer or mattress company or health care company under sec investigation or purveyor of lethal intelligence or something.

6/11/21 08:29,"$CLOV was a meme stock, but it was undervalued before the surge I‚Äôll admit it, I didn‚Äôt do any fucking research into CLOV beyond the meme potential and have noticed it drop of the map on mentions/comments/posts. So if you‚Äôre like me and still holding on to some this is for you, and if you‚Äôve seen the massive spike AND drop that happened after the last few days and you‚Äôre thinking about buying up shares or calls then read on. 

So as far as I can tell here are the big points consolidates for easy reading 

‚Ä¢ The company has 4 employees? Obviously not. It was merged back in January with a SPAC run by Chamath Palihapitiya which is a guy known for supporting meme-rising stocks like GME and AMC. So P.P. Pretty much owns the company as far as I‚Äôm concerned.

‚Ä¢ the inflation numbers that came out definitely hurt SPAC‚Äôs in general, plus with a huge spike the price was coming down regardless. I sold most at the top and made great gains but depending on tomorrow if it drops lower I‚Äôm dropping everything back into it for longer term. 

‚Ä¢ CLOV had a HUGE bullish bet from P.P. before the stock even exploded and the dude is known for merging private company‚Äôs with SPAC‚Äôs, going public, and making profits. That was Jan and now we‚Äôre in JUNE.

‚Ä¢ crayons and graphs tell me that this company was on its way up past $20 during the merge but there was in investigation started up about the company misleading investors. That being said, the company‚Äôs still didn‚Äôt get shorted like the rest of these easy-to-short companies around the time. 


If you‚Äôve gotten this far congrats you can read and if you haven‚Äôt here‚Äôs the TLDR/summary: 

CLOV is undervalued being blow $20. There isn‚Äôt much short interest on the company so this isn‚Äôt a fucking ‚Äúmeme war‚Äù stock but something to invest in and make some money on in the next month or two after nerves settle from stupid ape-shit meme‚Äôing and inflation data becoming older news.

Without further ado, let‚Äôs get to the business: the first thing to look at, is a beautiful triangular wedge formation at the core of each chart. WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC‚Äôs price action after the breakout. \[Juicy is what juicy does\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc\_looking\_juicy\_next\_resistance\_targets\_1623/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.

As you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it‚Äôs fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. 

So far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.

Another thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.

And the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).

Overall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?

Love you and fuck you with all of my heart,

Roman, aka TA degenerate.

Oh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:

6/11/21 03:58,"AMC. WHOS WITH ME. ü¶ß Today is a big day, and this week is a big week. While $AMC share price has been suppressed in last few days, we just had the announcement today about $AMC share counts. The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.
I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.
- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021
- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting
- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.
Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192
- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm:
Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6%
Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4%
Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2%
Insider Ownership 6.5%
Other 67.4%

Total of institution ownership:
12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2%
Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors:
26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7%
Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners:
32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares
Shares needed to cover the records:
-63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M
- Synthetic shares:
total number of synthetic shares: Z
naked shorts: X
naked call contracts: Y
other naked shares: W
Z = X + Y + W
Short interest:
Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares
Minimum number of synthetic shares from public records:
100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely)
Hidden number of synthetic shares:
U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge.
Minimum number of synthetic shares
37M + U
- Bottom line:
37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.

Hope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought. GLTL.",48751,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999867678,True

6/11/21 01:55,"6/18 $40 call #AMC #DD I thought this looked a little strange. 

3 weeks ago, 5/25, there were 243,000 plus open call options for the 6/10 $40 call options with a volume of 23,000 plus that same day. So the next day there were 266,000 plus contracts open on that date for the $40 strike. 

This was when the stock price was at $21 and IV wasn‚Äôt nearly as high as it is now so theta was not very high at all. IV was 0.18 or $18 and each contract had a price of $0.54 or $54. I know this becuase I bought 4 of those contracts that day. 

Today those contracts are worth $1,400 a piece. I was looking at the open interest today and saw that there were only 118,243 contracts on that same strike price now. 

I know some people have probably day trades that contract or paper handed it during dips but a more than 50% drop just doesn‚Äôt seem logical. Now that we know Market Makers ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù, saying this for legal reasons, collude with hedge funds, thanks to Wes Christian proving this in over 60 cases theoughout the years, does it not seem a little suspect that so many call options for that strike price on 6/18 have ‚Äúclosed‚Äù? 

We have basically proved there are naked shorts out there with the new shareholder count, which doesn‚Äôt even include all investors, we have new rulings by the SEC coming into effect soon, there are lawsuits being filed for market manipulation, and all of the momentum is on our side. So why would that many people close their position when there are still 8 days to expiration and they are up 2,150.00% on that call heading into a big week? 

Even from yesterday, there were 125,000 plus open interest and another 14,000 plus volume on that call.

6/10/21 12:45,"Technical analysis June 9th This is not trading advice.

AMC had an absolutely incredible bullish move supported by technicals and volume (and shorts and gamma). It now looks to be creating a failure swing (lower high). You can see on the backside here we've lost the parabola and the bullish trendline. Volume is not supportive of this bounce. You can see that volume has declined on this bounce vs the increasing volume that we saw on the initial rally. RSI / MACD are rolling over.

The one thing I will say about AMC vs GME or BB right now is there are 125,000 calls in the money expiring next week on AMC at the $40 strike. If it's able to hold the $40 level into next week we might see another gamma move. For now though it looks like bears have control. Based on this setup I would expect we end the week pretty close to that big $32 level. If we lose $32 we should head towards $14.

I do have a position against AMC which you can see in my previous posts.

6/10/21 12:16,"Clearing up common confusions and misunderstandings with CLOV & Additional DD **Posts have been surfacing all around Reddit/Twitter/Stocktwits regarding uncertainty and confusion about the integrity of CLOV due to its sudden thrust in to the spotlight this week so I'm creating this thread to answer common questions and provide some insight.**

CLOV SEC Filings/Recent Releases/Events: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/investor-relations](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/investor-relations)

\_\_\_

**Common Questions and Concerns (Sources numbered at the bottom):**

**Q:** **Clover Health has 80/90/100%+ institutional ownership! This is very clearly a collaboration by the hedge funds to earn back their lost money from shorting GME/AMC/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**

**A:**  Institutional ownership =/= shorts.

Institutions decide if they are shorting a position or holding for the long haul. CLOV isn't just a meme stock, they are a disruptor in the Medicare advantage field with promising and improving results quarter after quarter. They were added to the MSCI index in May**^(1)** and are being added to the Russell 3000 index on June 25th at market close**^(2)**.

CLOV has had a high short interest for months**^(3)** driving the price down from $17 in December 2020 to bottoms of $6 making this a prime long pick for non-shorting institutions in the intermediary time between then and now. Citadel isn't even in the top ten for institutional ownership**^(4)**. Do you know who is in the top ten? Vanguard and Blackrock, both very well-known for investing in to companies most likely to be successful.

Number one in institutional CLOV holdings? Greenoaks Capital. ""***Greenoaks Capital believes a small handful of high-quality technology companies define each generation. Their mission is to identify those companies early in their life cycle and partner with them for decades.***"" **^(5)**

\_\_\_

**Q:** **Citadel owns 500,000 shares of CLOV, this must be a distraction scheme to cover their positions for AMC/GME/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**

**A:** Citadel DID indeed own 500,000 shares of CLOV as of 03-31**^(6)**‚Äî Citadel also happens to have been holding over 700,000 shares of AMC as of the same date**^(7)**. Citadel owns approximately 0.45% of the entire existing non-shorted float of CLOV. Shorting Institutions often hold long and short positions at the same time. This is a normal occurrence.

6/10/21 11:05,"Realistic DD on UWMC This has been a great 2 weeks for stocks. In this time AMC led the way and showed the shorter sellers the power of retail. This week, we saw the boosts of CLOV, BB, GME, TLRY, WKHS, CLF and CLNE. One name has probably been in everyone‚Äôs peripheral vision: UWMC. 

Today was a mixed sentiment day with many of our tickers seeing pullbacks and folks taking profit. UWMC was able to weather the storm. In a full day session, UWMC not once dip below 6% green. It held strong even as the other popular ticker experienced sell downs. The reason for this is simple: it‚Äôs a GREAT company.

Here are just some highlights of upcoming catalysts:

1. Increasing short interest, 55% over the past few weeks. Despite the stellar performance over the last few days short interest went up.

2. Resilience to short attacks. Through the day there were several obvious short attempts to pull the down the stock but UWMC recovered instantly each time. This demonstrates an enormous pool of buyers with eyes locked.

3. Russell 2000 inclusion this Friday. I don‚Äôt think I need to point out the obvious benefits of ETFs in this play.

4. 4% Dividends will be distributed on July 6th. Many of these dividend distributions will find its way back into the stock.

5. 50K share insider purchase this morning. When memes go up, insiders sell. This is Not the case with UWMC. Insiders are buying! That‚Äôs how much management believes in the company.

6. There‚Äôs still the 300M share buyback that‚Äôs taking place while we ride.

6/10/21 08:16,"A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

6/10/21 07:58,"WWE Most Memeable Stock in WSB History (see inside for details) APES,

By now WWE should be on everyones tendie radar after today's outsized move on large volume (6x the normal daily volume). The combination of low float (\~44M), high short interest (18-22%) and the sheer number of extremely memeable wrastling GIFs set this one up to be one for the history books. The options chain is also primed to explode. I could easily see this running back to the old ATHs within the next few months.

On top of that we have the return of live events next month in Texas and potential buyout rumors floating around adding fuel to the fire. This summer is setting up to be big for McMahon and his merry crew of men in leotards, we should all profit from this greatly.

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD‚Äôs and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal √† 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month‚Ä¶.

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y‚Äôall degenerates

P.S. This is not a financial advice, I‚Äôm just posting for fun and for educational purpose. Have a good day and make DD‚Äôs :)

6/16/21 06:26,"DD on BBBY: grotesquely over-shorted stonk with great fundamentals compared to competitors I'm not going to talk about BBBY's new management that's turning the company around (just like in GME!), or that 32% of its float has been shorted (that's pretty ridiculous all by itself) - I'll just post some fundamentals for y'all to look at and make your own conclusions:

1. P/E ratio of 18.47 vs industry average P/E of 19.57.

2. P/B ratio of 2.66 vs industry average of 5.83.

3. P/S ratio of 0.35 vs industry average of 0.89.

4. P/CF ratio of 11.79 vs industry average of 23.19.

Quarterly earnings will come out in less than a month, on July 14th. BBBY has been under intense short-seller attack after briefly spiking at $44.51 on 6/02. Just last week, it got driven down by 9% on Wednesday and another 9% on Thursday. All of that was on zero news: just plain and simple short-seller feeding frenzy...

I'm not posting this to hype anything up or to distract anyone from AMC/BB/GME (there's plenty of over-shorted stonks with good fundamentals for all of us) - I'm merely writing down my own research as I learn more about BBBY. With every dip, I either average down or buy more calls. When - not if, but when - this spikes up again, it'll be fucking glorious. :)

The earnings will come out on July 14th. A lot of Wall Street types seem to like BBBY's fundamentals and its transformation, which is why I expect a reversal of the downward trend as we get closer to that date. Will it work its way back up to $35, or $40, or pull a GME and spike way the hell up? I don't know, but I'll be there for it. :) Join me if you'd like.

I was inspired by the [WWE post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcyxf/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/) in here last week, so I thought fuck it lets use his patented S.M.E.L.L system to sniff out WWE junior. For those of you who missed out on the sweet tendies from WWE last week here‚Äôs your chance to redeem yourself. Vizio is no GME or AMC, but as long as I‚Äôm getting 1000% gains mainlined to my mommy‚Äôs basement I don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

# I: Fundamentals

I know 97% of you retards don‚Äôt about fundamentals let alone even know how to spell fundamental, but for the 3% that can tie your own shoes here‚Äôs some highlights from their Q1 [results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006163/en/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q1-2021-Financial-Results): 

&#x200B;

* Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million for Q1
* Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million
* Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million
* Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million
* SmartCast Active Accounta grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million
* SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

And here‚Äôs the part that gets me the most excited, Gross Profit from Platform is up 152% year over year. Vizio is already ranked #2 in best selling TV brand and #1 in best selling soundbars, and now they‚Äôre going to start competing in the smart TV market. The king of the smart TV Market right now is Roku, controlling a [30% market share as of Q1 2021](https://9to5google.com/2021/05/03/roku-global-streaming-marketshare-drops/#:~:text=Conviva%20reports%20(via%20Protocol)%20that,to%2030%25%20in%20Q1%202021.). The King is hurt right now, reeling from their awkward breakup with [Youtube TV](https://clark.com/streaming-tv/roku-announces-youtube-tv-breakup/). Turns out Youtube TV actually prefers Vizio‚Äôs [magnum dong](https://www.engadget.com/vizio-smart-cast-owners-no-longer-need-two-apps-for-you-tube-132131066.html#:~:text=Just%20here%20to%20drop%20a,in%20the%20next%20few%20days.). I‚Äôm willing to bet Vizio becomes a major player in the streaming market, plus they have the advantage of already being a huge TV manufacturer. Roku certainly got a head start, but we‚Äôve seen companies blow a 3-1 lead before \*cough\* Skype. We all know streaming is the future, and the future of Vizio‚Äôs Smartcast (and by extension our tendies) right now is bright. And I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this, As of 6/11/2021 Vizio has 7 Buy ratings and a consensus price target of $30.29. For the mathematically challenged that‚Äôs a *33.6%* upside from where the stock is now. Or put simply to any boomers skulking around, that‚Äôs 3.36 years of returns compared to your boomer index S&P fund, and I‚Äôm being fucking generous. 

# II. Catalysts

Vizio is getting into the data tracking/advertisement business as well, recently reporting that they have just surpassed [11 million addressable enabled TVs](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005230/en/VIZIO-Surpasses-11-Million-Addressable-Enabled-TVs) in the US. Why does this matter? It's yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god, and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies. For those of you who live under a rock, almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers, and Vizio is finally getting into the game. We're only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep, so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant. 

# III: Technicals

Here‚Äôs why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior.

**Extremely low float:** The float on this is around 18 million shares, which is less than half of the float on WWE. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio‚Äôs float is only 4% of AMC‚Äôs and less than half of GME‚Äôs. If you‚Äôre still confused let me say it this way. If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn‚Äôt be enough shares to go around. I‚Äôve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non-bullshit stocks I‚Äôve been able to find. And by non-bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money. 

**Volume is low:** Volume is extremely low and trending lower. Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO. 

**Options are cheap:** IV on this stock is only 54%. For reference, when CLNE popped the IV was around 80%. If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably. It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33% upside. 

**Moderate SI:** The SI is only moderate sitting at 7%, but still enough to cause some heartburn. And fuck it, it‚Äôs you know what season. With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies. 

**Huge Omega:** With the IV so low it won‚Äôt take much movement for our options to print. The [Omega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omega.asp), or elasticity is huge. For example, when Vizio went up 3.60% last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84%, or an Omega of 23.4. Plus not only is the Omega large, the options chains are fucking *scarce.* July FDs only go up to $30 strike, and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that‚Äôs below their target price. 

# IV: Conclusion

This is my pick for a low-risk high reward play.  Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap. On the 3.6% move last Friday even my Nov 19 $25 calls went up 12%. It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week, and I think we could have a similar situation here. 

You could even play this stock like a boomer (buy and hold, can‚Äôt go tits up) and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target. I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing. I‚Äôm personally holding shares, June 18 22.5 C, July 16 25 C, and Nov 19 25 C, and if this post gains traction here I'll probably add some 25C FDs. 

Not financial advice, buy some shares and options or don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt really give a fuck. I just like the stock and the 32"" Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I'd share this post with you degenerates.

6/17/21 02:53,"Tesla Ultimate DD Alright degenerates, how many times have your FDs expired worthless and left you recording your wife getting blown out for the weekend by her favorite day trader bf. Cause personally it's been far too many times for me and that's why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of.

Fuck squeezes I've had it with those DDs and honestly, I don't think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis. Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn't empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped.

Back in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod  showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn.  Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once.

&#x200B;

DD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn't just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. **High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it!** Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the **largest overnight asset increase in history**. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming ""squeeze"" about the latest stock they saw on somebody's shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize.   

TLDR: FSD --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck)

TLDR: Batteries --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of **DOJO,** a neural net trainer. I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that **AI runs on DATA.** The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have **billions** of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google's Waymo has a laughable **millions**. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society.

TLDR: AI & DOJO --> Stock to the Moon

&#x200B;

The crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven't covered many of Tesla's massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well)  I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it'll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. 

More points if somehow you still aren't convinced

\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS

\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast.

\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries.

\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective.

\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong.

\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter?

&#x200B;

If you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls.

POSITIONS: TSLA 1/21/2023 1500, 1600, 1700 strikes

note that u gotta buy leaps, not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things. Although they might be late, they always come you just gotta diamond hands till then. The man literally made rockets land I think he can make cars drive.",49477,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.497998118,True
6/17/21 01:24,"A Bull's Case for AMC TL;DR at bottom

I‚Äôm extremely bullish on AMC. In fact, more than I was back in late January and early February. The inflation rate, collateral issues, and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers. As you may be aware, during the AMC shareholder count that occurred on June 2nd, CEO Adam Aaron stated retail investors comprise 80% of AMC shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each. As of 9am EST this Wednesday morning, AMC has seen 1.76 million trades, and despite no new huge news, it‚Äôs already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday‚Äôs close. So why are so many people selling? That‚Äôs the thing. I don‚Äôt think we are. Earlier this morning, Jim Cramer commented on AMC‚Äôs price action in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1405138423741100033):

‚ÄúMeme people AMC is down‚Ä¶. I think it‚Äôs time to burst in.‚Äù Now this is entirely speculation on my part, but I believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack, which is something that many GME, AMC, and other tickers are familiar with. That being said, I do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly. However, no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. In the past 5 months alone, retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people. In fact, this past Monday (the 14th), when AMC surged 15%, it caused over $515 million worth of losses. This is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we‚Äôve seen, but they add up. Another interesting piece of information I learned is that recent reports showed that AMC is the most traded stock on Fidelity and Freetrade, and the 3rd most traded stock on Robinhood. Just take look below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I personally dislike the Motely Fool, but it allowed me to view information provided by Robinhood. As you can see, sentiment for AMC remains high across multiple brokerages.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As you can see above, ever since June 2nd, AMC has managed to remain above $42.72 and this has continued for two whole weeks! This has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers. It went as far as touching $70 just two weeks ago. And although it is currently in the mid-50‚Äôs range, I believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks. According to the data on Webull, AMC has seen more large-scale orders recently. This might be due to the amount of options expiring this Friday, the 18th. Down below, I‚Äôve listed the large-scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days:

6/09: $1,829,580

6/10: $4,826,810

6/11: $6,961,840

6/14: $5,458,670

6/15: $9,946,860

Mind you, this is the net value of all large-scale orders that were placed those days. In other words, it took the difference from all the large-scale buys as well as the large-scale sells. The final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number, meaning there were more buys than sells. That doesn‚Äôt even take into account people buying from RH, Etrade, Fidelity, etc. Needless to say, buying pressure is immense right now, which may the reason there has been an increase of FUD, shills, and bots trying to direct people away from AMC and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump.

In terms of good news, AMC is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in L.A., which would include two shopping mall locations. With both tourists and locals visiting during the summer, and with more and more Americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it, it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on. This change might not be an immediate one, of course, but it does force investors to consider the long-term plays that come with it.

Short sellers can‚Äôt hold forever, but investors can. Short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day, as we all know, they‚Äôll be forced to cover. When this happens, it‚Äôll be every man for himself. Seeing as to how many of us control the stock, though, we could, in theory, just not sell, which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price. It should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual, hence the phrase: ‚ÄúApes together strong.‚Äù

TL;DR I feel as though bitch boy Cramer and his ass-kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper-hand. He wants our bananas, but I refuse to give it to him. I think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable, but on the verge of further increasing. As always, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. Do your own research before making any investment decisions. I just like the stock. AMC to the moon, my friends",49487,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.981483638,True

6/16/21 11:36,"Former hedge fund trader breaks down why TWNK is an insanely good value play AND speculative meme stock to ride  üì∑üì∑

**TL;DR** \- *$TWNK has great value, can be a great long-term play with steady income through buying stock only or buy-write call option strategy,* ***\*AND\**** *it's an insanely good short term speculative play because it has higher/similar short interest % than GME or AMC and trades on way less volume with an insane \~20 days for shorts to cover so it has üöÄüöÄüöÄ potential!*

""Guess it's impossible to post on WSB? If anyone knows how help me out. I'm not new to Reddit but I'm old (40s) and haven't used it in years so I lost my username lol.""  -Posted for user: u/TeddyPayne12

I'm a former hedge fund trader who left the business years ago to pursue a more meaningful career, aka I've been poor ever since üòÇ No but for real üò≠ Started trading seriously again last year when the market crashed and did fairly well. Loving this Ape era, missed GME but still holding some AMC calls!

I'm super bullish on $TWNK for 2 reasons (with a bunch of sub-reasons): because I believe in its **value** (analysis below) and it's a double play trade for **speculation**.

**1. VALUE**

there's very little downside risk in the stock, which makes it a perfect pure equity play (buy the stock)-OR-you can buy-write it all day long (buy stock and sell equivalent number of calls, so you collect the premium and make a great return PLUS you put a stop-loss order on your downside so you can't lose a penny).

*EXAMPLE OF BUY-WRITE*: TWNK closed at $16.50 last night. The July $17.50 calls were $1. If you buy 100 shares of the stock for $16.50 and sell 1 option contract at $1, you've spent $1,550 total (100 x $16.50 for stock) minus (1 x 100 x $1 for calls) = $1,550.

1. If the stock goes to $17.50 or above -- the contract will be exercised, so you'll have no position left but you'll have just made another $100, making $200 on your $1,550 which is 13% in a month(!)
2. If the stock hovers in between $16.50 and $17.50 -- you sell at whatever price it ends at, add that to your $100 from selling the calls and that's your profit -OR- you sell the next month's calls and collect more profit while the stock hovers
3. If the stock goes down then you just set a stop-loss limit order at whatever price you don't want to go below and you'll lock in profits/minimize losses (since you're protected on price down to $15.50 from selling the calls)

Regarding TWNK value, there have been some posts in the past 1 week to 4 months that did a pretty good job so I won't repeat them here but take a look then I'll tell you what I think.

Here's what I'll add:

1. **Possible news TODAY**: investor meeting at Evercore ISI Consumer and Retail Summit ([webcast here](https://www.hostessbrands.com/events/event-details/evercore-isi-consumer-retail-summit))
2. It consistently beats market expectations
3. Upcoming summer season with more drivers on the road and sky high post-pandemic travel expected will boost sales, which are driven by convenience stores and through which they have a ""differentiated distribution model that gives Hostess unique access"" per Morningside analyst report
4. It has consistently beaten market expectations and added value for investors ever since it re-emerged as a \*brand new company\* after bankruptcy -- not a reorg of the old one. Per one analyst report: ""After the 2012 bankruptcy, investors purchased only the brand rights and recipes from the bankruptcy court, freeing them of employee benefits and other labor obligations that had weighed down the company in the past.""

**SPECULATION**

Above are my reasons for *investing* in $TWNK, but below are my reasons I am *trading* it right now.

If people decided this was the new meme stock, it would be a wild ride -- it's 17% shorted per the latest report (5/28) and trades on very little volume -- around a million shares a day normally with 131 million shares outstanding. By comparison, AMC traded about 5 \*million\* shares a day before all this craziness happened, with 450 million shares outstanding and 22% short interest. GME traded about 3 million shares a day on 72 million shares outstanding and 20% short interest.

Because of the volume -- it's short ratio is super high -- 20.15 as of today, which means it would take shorts 20 days to cover. That makes it about as ripe for a short squeeze as a stock can get.

**BOTTOM LINE**

Can't really find a reason why not to buy the stock, or at least buy-write it and protect yourself on the downside. If people pile into it -- we could be talking about serious money if the stock pops.

Disclosure

I am long TWNK stock and I have a covered call position worth about 5% of my portfolio, which is nothing big (\~$80k lol)

I detected that AMC has been actively growing from the perspective of [website‚Äôs traffic](https://contora.ai/ticker/amc#website_traffic) and a number of [open job positions](https://contora.ai/ticker/amc#job_openings) recently. Perhaps they are actively expanding their staff - almost 2.5K new open positions with a staff of 5K employees - this is quite a big turnover.

Also, the traffic to the $AMC website has [doubled](https://contora.ai/ticker/amc#website_traffic) over the past 4 months! Considering that the website is one of their biggest sales channels - it's a brilliant indicator and we will see great profit figures in the report for the second quarter.

Most of below is copy and pasted from the article highlighting what I believe to be important. 

But I'd like to hear from everyone else and their thoughts about why this would be a good play or why it wouldn't be. 

Short interest is currently at 26% vs AMC @ 20% and GME @ 21%. 

Options  are also dirt cheap for 2 months out. 

**Article Summery:** 

&#x200B;

* Skillz is growing rapidly, with the potential for sales to accelerate as the company enhances monetization and completes the Aarki acquisition.
* The company enjoys fantastic margins which should lead to profitability without much struggle. Skillz has enough firepower to sustain several money-losing quarters without any dilution, regardless.
* Additionally, the stock is position greatly for a short squeeze based on its technicals, at a time when the Reddit army is actively looking for such opportunities.
* We are taking advantage of the increased volatility and high premiums to sell PUTs with the potential for massive returns.

**Why this is a great company to invest in even regardless of the short squeeze:** 

&#x200B;

* The company generated 92% of revenue growth year-over-year, primarily as a result of 81% growth in paying monthly active users.
* The company enjoys gross margins of 94%, which indicates plenty of room for a rich bottom line as the company continues to scale.
* The company ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $613 million of cash.
* The company has no debt on its balance sheet to pressure its bottom line further.

Right now the company isn't profitable since they are in growth mode. Considering the fat gross margins, it should not struggle to turn green if the company pursues the profitability road.

This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests.

It has been a tough week in the market with SPY dropping 2%, Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its worst weekly loss since October, and most popular stocks taking a beating. The main reason for the fall is the concern that Federal Reserve could start raising rates sooner than expected due to inflation concerns bringing a stop to the continuous rally we have seen in the last year.

AMC continues to be the most talked-about stock with a 20% WoW gain in stock price. Even though the overall number of discussions seems to be waning (last week AMC had 17K mentions), investors are becoming more and more bullish as reflected in the sentiment.

Taking about the bullish view, WISH has the highest sentiment across all the stocks reflecting the investor confidence in the stock. Both WISH and CLNE overtook GME in the discussion volume across Reddit and Twitter. Other than these 3, all the other stocks had a rough week in the market with Clover health dropping a massive 20% last week.

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Petco Health and Wellness($WOOF):** WOOF had a wild ride this week with the stock gaining more than 20% on Monday and still ending in red at the end of the week. Unlike many other meme stocks, analyst‚Äô‚Äô consensus is a [strong buy](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/petco-health-vs-chewy-pet-131320193.html) for the stock with an upside of almost 30% from the current price levels. The company is expected to gain considerably from the increasing trends of pet adoption during Covid and people‚Äôs willingness to spend more on their pets.

**DraftKings($DKNG):** The company was trending as Hindenburg Research published a report calling DraftKings ""a $21 billion SPAC betting it can hide its black-market operations."" The stock fell 4% on the news and the stock has shed almost 10% throughout the week. Wall Street analysts have [said](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-allegations-short-seller-hindenburg-51623869779) that these allegations are nothing new and unregulated market exposure is a common theme for international sports betting companies.

**Corsair Gaming($CRSR):** The prodigal son has finally returned! CRSR was the [first stock that I identified using the program and did a DD on](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmmn1g/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The stock had a wild week, soaring more than 30% with 20x the average trading volume. The fall also was just as steep with the stock losing all the gains within the next 3 days. The company had an exceptional year during Covid with net revenue of $1.7B (55% increase YoY) and a gross profit of 456MM (107% increase YoY).

**Nio Inc($NIO):** After reaching highs of $64 in February, NIO had fallen to $31 in May. The stock seems to be picking up momentum and has shown consistent growth since then (risen over 40% over the last month). Adding to this, NIO has also become the best-selling EV brand for SUVs in China with its market share now up to 25%. Both these factors are driving the increasing chatter for the stock.

Yes.


Was the air conditioning working?

Not really.


Was it clean?

No.


Was the popcorn good?

No.


Was the Coke good?

NO BECAUSE THE SELL TRASH ASS PEPSI NOW.


According to every study ever done, Coke is more popular than Pepsi in the US. According to the same study, Coke has a more loyal fan base. I can deal with bad popcorn or a warm room, BUT WHO TF WANT A BLUE PEPSI CUP WHEN THEY'RE AT A MOVIE?!?!

Even my one friend who likes Pepsi admits that there's something wrong with having Pepsi at a movie theater. 

At the moment I saw the Pepsi sign I knew I was never going back to a Regal theater and will only go to the AMC further away from my house. Many more people will do the same.

Alright boys and girls, listen the fuck up cause I'm going to get straight to the point. Currently estimated **60% Short Interest**, with a *market cap* just **below 2 billion** and *float* of **112.69M**.

[Ortex Data \(SI 60.03&#37; of float as of 06\/18\)](https://preview.redd.it/voulhjhuz4671.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=f727dda32e1ba8ebc6ca3faf6f06a34a93ca1ad6)

So now what the fuck does this mean? Let's compare to AMC. AMC currently have a *market cap* of **30 BILLION** with a *float* of **448.49 MILLION** and only **13.45% Short Interest** as of last Friday.

Now because the float & market cap of WKHS is much lower, it takes significantly less bananas to get the rocket ship going. WKHS only needs a mere fucking fraction of the volume AMC saw for it to see a Thanos Infinity Squeeze and fuck the shorts to kingdom come.

# Technical Analysis

[This is my take on le squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/j7eyz7id25671.png?width=2672&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0c124f1d0a848dd4deb3e0303154e4332123496)

Now listen here you fucks, I do have data to back this up. ORTEX send out trading signals based on algorithmic backtesting or some bullshit like that. They sent out a Short Squeeze Signal on June 10th, which according to them you are likely to see the highest returns *11 days* after the signal was fired, which would be on the 25th of June.

[SS Signal](https://preview.redd.it/3tecoxx835671.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad5d18dcc26caf74bb0f358b59efc590f1ac4eaa)

So now, let's compare the ORTEX data now with the previous squeeze.

Looking at the previous squeeze that occurred on the 26th of Jan, we can see that it gapped up to a high of **$42.96** on just **33% Short Interest**. Now imagine what the fuck we could do with **60%**.

How I see it is, we are so close to seeing a huge run up to at least **$30**. For you monkeys that don't math, that's a **+100% gain**, and anyone will the balls to yolo options you'll see significantly more.

After 2 weeks of AMC hype videos filling up my YT recommendation lists, countless online ""analysts"" completely bullish on the impending ""gamma squeeze"" that was all but assured to hit on Friday 6/18.... today passed with not much difference than any other day.

It honestly feels like we're playing poker at a high stakes table with the Hedge Funds with our cards facing up and looking around the room like we're secretly the smartest guy at the table.

Is it time for us to truly snap back into reality and really look at what's going on here?  Let's be honest... the hedge funds have had weeks/months to learn from their GME mistakes.  Any call options that would have been out of the money today was probably already hedged against days/weeks ago.  Even if they let $40 and $50 OTM options expire today, they are probably recuperating their losses in profits elsewhere in their portfolio.  There may never come a situation where the AMC short squeeze will actually happen.  The gamma squeeze??  Well, that's already happened when it spiked from $10 to $72.  If that's not ""to the moon"", I'm not sure what is, especially for a stock that is 70% over-valued atm.

I understand that this is a ""movement"" and that it's ""ape/retailers vs the big funds"" but I'm also seeing alot of people here yolo their entire savings onto a meme stock.  Am I the only one who thinks that we're doing a complete disservice to the amateur investors here who do not really know what they are doing and \*actually\* thinking they are making wise investments?

At the end of the day, there is no reality where the big hedge funds will just sit & watch and roll-over while we squeeze AMC to $100+ and then tuck their tails between their legs and just swallow the losses without any strategic plan.  I think anyone who is still waiting and believing in this will be the ones left holding the bag.  The same people who held at $20 will be holding at $60, will still be holding even at $120 (if that ever comes) and one day, they will be left holding the bag regretting all of the chances they had to cash out for profit along the way.  Do these ""diamond hands"" actually have an exit plan?

As the old saying goes, it's not a loss until you sell.  But the inverse is also true.  It's never a gain if you hold forever either.  Am I missing something here or are we still all convinced that the hedge funds will stare down an oncoming semi-truck and just stand there like a deer in headlights while retailers rob them blind?

Not these other memers and fakes

Stick with AMC and GME, our Godfathers

Yes, this is me pandering to them to gain more approval.

but it is sincere, since I'm invested into them myself.

but

WKHS has been around before the Bots and spammers here in WSB

115 Million Float, 1/4th the size of AMC, making it 75% easier to Squezuird.

40% of the float is shorted.

Its an electric Vehicle/Drone company, so innovative and new/Trendy.

Its an Ohio Small town Manufacturing Blue collar worker business.

This really is a peoples Company, at least until it becomes bigger.

They lost a government contract that everyone expected them to win, so thats why they are shorted. And they deserved that contract and are in court proceedings to win it back, so there is definitely long term value here too, along with it being innovative. It holds a ton of hold value of speculation. 

I'm no stock expert, no numbers guy. Shoot, the only number I know is that it has $200 million cash on hand, so its not in debt.

Seriously. This stock has so much shorts against it and such a small number of shares, any volume can make this skyrocket. But theres so many other fakes, wannabes, bots and spams, its hard to get above it.

Stick with AMC and GME, our Godfathers.

Even our own Subreddit, people agree, we don't want to distract from AMC or GME. We are the OG apes.

But people are going to diversify. And when they do, I woulds hope that the AMC and GME Apes support us as the best option outside of the ApeGod Stocks.",49807,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.94036895,True

6/18/21 05:55,"$AMC - Unbiased Technical Analysis - Another Great Setup Forming Will keep this one short - it's a very simple setup.

[$AMC 20D 2h](https://preview.redd.it/afqk0jr1hv571.png?width=2229&format=png&auto=webp&s=19db705d71358b0e8d9b3136c612fc40a7553403)

Since topping out a couple weeks ago - AMC has been forming a fantastic symmetrical triangle on the 2 hour chart. We rejected off of it today - and are battling with it as we speak (maybe we break it today?)

For a breakout - we need a **2 hour close above 63.55 -** this would then target **75.00 --> 100.00.**

There is also key support sitting at **60.63 -** would set your stop loss under here (if you have one) - below  we likely oscillate to the low end of the triangle.

In that scenario - the breakdown point is a **2 hour close below 42.00 -** this would then target **33.61 --> 20.00.**

Great setup to play either way - so try not to hold a bias if you like money.

One last note - be fucking careful tomorrow. I've noticed **they** **love to rail meme stocks** on Fridays - most often making them trade sideways and bleeding weekly call holders.

*Not Financial Advice*

I have a side play that you might be able to make some money on in addition to your fat AMC and GME positions. BarkBox (BARK) is an online subscription based service that sends you a box of toys and treats for your dog, they have an eCommerce site, BARK Bright for dogs health, and BARK Eats for dog food. A lot of stuff for dogs. The stock went public via a SPAC (STIC) June 2nd (not breaking rule 9, its a company now), it has not performed the best this month but I think that is about to change sometime soon. 

The nitty gritty -

**Market cap:** $1.7B

**Shares outstanding:** 166M 

**Price of stock:** $9.91

Pet ownership has mooned during the pandemic and is expected to continue. Morgasm Stanley estimates the pet current pet care market of $120 B will rise to $277 B by 2030. And we know all whose urban white women sure like to spend money on all their ""cute"" Pomeranians. Now she can browse BarkBox subscription packages with the pool boy is hitting it from the back while you are at work getting absolutely shit on by your manager for not getting that one guy from Ireland to approver you documentation...\*deep breathes...

ANYWAY

They have some management that literally came from Mars. CEO, Manish Joneja, is ex-Amazon and Ebay, working on Global Exports and Expansion for Amazon. Hendrik Werdelin is a cofounder with lots of experience in the online space, named ""top 100 most creative"" and ""top 100 in tech"" by Forbes. Not really sure if that's impressive or not. Also co-founder Carley Strife who leads Bark Eats with experience at Uber. They also have management experienced with bringing SPACs to market. 

Lets talk partnerships -

They have a lot; Target, Amazon, Petco, Costco, Homegoods, CVS, Dunkin Donuts?, PetSmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, and more. They also partner with a lot of dog shelters, who they give a $25 donation for every subscription through their affiliate program. 

‚ú®Financials‚ú® - or something 

Active subscriptions - 1.1 milly

Current Increase in subscriptions - 23% compounding yearly from 2018 to 2020

Expected Increase in subscriptions - 47% compounding yearly from 2021 to 2023

Gross profit per subscription - 2020; $71 and expectations for 2021 are around $108

Gross Margin: $135 million in 2020

Gross margins in first half of 2021: 61%

&#x200B;

Some of the bigger players owning the stock include;

Competitors; 

Chewy, Freshpet, Trupanion, and BullyMake

In the long run BARK has a dominate media presence (1.7 million Instagram followers), strong gross margins. Weaknesses include a stock that been performing bad to poor this month and a business strategy that isn't really unique. Opportunities include the stellar pet spending that has been happening since the pandemic, and the new product lines like Bark Eats.

6/26/21 05:05,"Identifying bots on WSB Spotting a bot:

1. Are they suggesting a company that you are not interested in hearing about? Bot

2. Does their advice sound logical and like would it make you money? Definitely a bot

3. Down vote them and if it sticks, they are a bot

4. Look at their account age. After seeing how old their account is, pick a number higher than that. If the age of their account is lower than the number that you just picked; they are a bot! This one can also be applied to karma.

Other signs: lack of crayons, lack of imagery and videos with green arrows edited into them, lack of OG stocks like GME and AMC. Any use of Robinhood is 100% a bot.

If you find a bot immediately report them to mods, if you are lucky and they're suggesting something that mods haven't invested in, their account will be banned very soon.

6/25/21 10:44,"Good for AMC CNK IMAX and rest of exhibitors - Weekend Box Office Forecast: F9 Is On Track to Write the Next Chapter in Pandemic Era Record Books After multiple delays and a year‚Äôs worth of the Universal marketing engine revving up, we in the US are about to enjoy the long awaited release of ***F9***.

This ninth film in the *Fast & Furious* franchise was originally slated to open over Memorial Day weekend in 2020 until COVID-19 muffled those plans. The studio took the long-view and pushed the film into 2021 and eventually settled on this final June weekend for its release as part of a staggered global rollout that began with China‚Äôs launch in May.

Box Office Pro says: ""there‚Äôs little doubt that *F9* is in the best position of any film since the pandemic began as the next ‚Äî and perhaps biggest yet ‚Äî blockbuster release.""

After **F9**'s $136 million May 2021 debut in China exceeded *Hobbs & Shaw*‚Äòs $94.9 million back in August 2019, and its $6.7 million opening weekend in Australia (good for exhibitor Reading Int'l) also bested that spin-off‚Äôs local start of $4.9 million, Box OfficePro forecasts opening weekend North America domestic revenue at **$60 ‚Äì 80 million.** Check out their total forecast and Pros & Cons influencing these numbers in the following article:

6/24/21 16:55,"CNK looks like a win-win CNK ""Cinemark Holdings, Inc"" has rallied as a sympathy play off that other movie chain. With ~20% short interest and a 6.5 short ratio - possibly the same bettors against AMC - the squeeze is still juicy.

There's much more going for it beneath the surface though.

Unlike many entertainment and event businesses, CNK did not need to dilute during the COVID downturn, and in fact recently re-financed some nearer-term debt to long-term leaving it with ample cash ($4.42/sh or 19% mkt cap today, current est) to pursue growth/acquisition (mentioned during earnings) or be liquid enough to grind out a slow re-opening.

EBITDA for FY19 (pre-COVID) was $745M on $3.3B revenue with an Enterprise Value (EV) of $6.4B (2019, 10-yr median is roughly $5.5B). Compare that to AMC with $716M EBITDA on $5.4B revenue with an EV of $10.9B.

So CNK was a cheaper/less indebted business that produces higher EBITDA on lower revenue. Check check check. (If EV isn't your flavor, they have net +$1.1B assets long term as of 3/31/21 vs -$2.2B for AMC.)

With their solid financial position, CNK is already considering when they can re-instate a dividend, which was 4% pre-COVID. (2Q22 target for me.)

CNK has also had long-term interest in E-Sports and Gaming partnerships, and their PR in June sent set off a nice spike, which is a good test for the theory that it's set up to run on a good catalyst. I personally believe the Gaming segment will reach parity with the motion picture segment in the long run as gaming is now a more prominent form of entertainment and the typical theater setup can be augmented in creative ways (4D, VR arcade, high-margin beverage and food offerings, large events).

I think fundamentally, CNK is well-managed, well-positioned for the near and long term, and presently undervalued.

Things get even more interesting when you consider the price action over the last 6 months, in steady uptrend with occasional spikes. Price broke above a large bull flag at the end of May, and then broke a falling wedge today on strong opening and closing volume. This wedge break was after a few daily hammers that seem to indicate a bounce off a demand zone aka sellers are exhausted. Commons were a great entry at 21.40 this week.

The most enticing Risk-Reward seems to be in longer-term options due to the low Implied Volatility (IV). It's been around 56 which is 80% lower than AMC. This means the option premiums are much lower than AMC. Which means your ""bet"" on CNK costs a lot less. Also, call options appear to be sweeping for a couple of weeks now, including Jul 25C, 30C, Dec 25C, 30C, and Jan 25C, 30C.

The last angle I have is this: money is flowing from one squeeze play to the next, and since CNK hasn't squeezed yet, I believe it can benefit either in sympathy to a big AMC squeeze OR if AMC craters and folks plunge into #CNKCHIMPS. The possibility is there for a massive trend and squeeze to start.

I'm long CNK and have an IWM short hedge.",50234,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999591172,True

6/23/21 05:54,"$RKT - PART 2!!! IMO RKT is about to repeat history!

Do you remember in March when we took this to $45 ? ? ? ? ?

Its following what appears to be the exact same set up as last time. Small spiratic gains, then shorted heavily. Then its rinse and repeat until the shorts start losing ground. The last time the bears were this out of ammo was the last GME and AMC skyrocketed end if February.

I'm getting deja vu.

This stock has hit its tipping point today in my opinion by breaking through the 19 dollar wall. It appears that the shorts covered then reapplied at 19 which we just broke through again. This was exactly what was happening from what I can tell last time she gamma squeezed.

Now with multiple stocks skyrocketing all in the same week, the hedge funds holding this down are extremely weak. RKT has been gaining volume the last week. RKT is a powder keg about to go off! The one major difference between this stock and the ""MEMES"" Is that ROCKET makes money, a shit ton of money.

Now I understand that we dont have the dividend news we had last time. I get that. But I think with the continuing pressure we still see another massive spike in RKTS future!

6/23/21 05:18,"$AMC Covered Options Trading  Hello, my dear option-trade-loving apes.

In light of the recent roller coaster events at $AMC, I think I have found a less retarded (most of you probably lose interest at this point) way of losing your bananas.

Covered options writing.

Option premiums at $AMC are still exaggerated as fuck and I think, provide an interesting opportunity to use some of your ~~gambling~~ investing money. With covered options writing, you get to collect the premium and limit your risk by owning the underlying asset ($AMC stock).

In my humble opinion there are multiple catalysts upcoming for the stock to drop (e.g. upcoming equity raise, reopening of the cinemas being less enthusiastic than the current expectations, etc.). Hence, I am choosing the short version of the trade. However, if you‚Äôre a real quality ape and are still shouting diamond hands in your sleep, a long version of the trade (write calls/buy stock) includes the same trade mechanics (just vice-versa). You can figure it out, trust me.

The trade itself is simple enough. You would write covered puts (short stock and sell OTM puts) expiring, for example, July 9th and short AMC stock at the current price of $55.69. Let's say you sell 100 shares of AMC and write 1 July 9th put option with a strike price of $40 for $4.1 (premium received).

From this point onwards there are 3 major scenarios:

* **If shares trade at $59.79 (share price + option premium), this is your break-even point.**
* **If $AMC trades below $59.79, your profit increases accordingly, up to the maximum profit level of $1979 at or below $40/share.**
* **If shares trade above $59.79, the option expires worthless, while your short position starts losing money. In this case, the downside is virtually unlimited, just as you like it.**

To make it really simple, what you need for this trade to work is $AMC share price to trade between the strike price of the option and the price at which you‚Äôve shorted (+ option premium). The closer it is to the strike price (in this case $40/share), the higher your upside and vice versa.

**Some more calculations at different potential price levels:** 

Price at $10:

* Short position: ($55.69-$10) \* 100 = $4569
* Put option: ($4.1-$30) \* 100 = -$2590
* Total profit: -$2590 + $4569 = $1979

Price at $35:

* Short position: ($55.69-$35) \* 100 = $2069
* Put option: ($4.1-$5) \* 100 = -$90
* Total profit: -$90 + $2069 = $1979

Price at $45:

* Short position: ($55.69-$45) \* 100 = $1069
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: $1069 + $410 = $1479

Price at $55:

* Short position: ($55.69-$55) \* 100 = $69
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: $69 + $410 = $479

Price at $59.79:

* Short position: ($55.69-$59.79) \* 100 = -$410
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: 0

Price at $70:

* Short position: ($55.69-$70) \* 100 = -$1431
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: -$1431 + $410 = -$1021

Price: $100

* Short position: ($55.69-$100) \* 100 = -$4431 
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: -$4431 + $410 = -$4021

I think this strategy works and [these guys](https://www.specialsituationinvestments.com/2021/06/amc-entertainment-amc-options-trade-100-upside/) managed to generate 100% in 2 weeks using a similar approach. The most important thing is to size the position accordingly, so that you don‚Äôt get wiped out if things go the other way. Keep in mind that this is not investment advice.

6/23/21 03:50,"Why AMD will reach $100 at the end of this month So I am going to keep my reasoning short and simple:  


1) AMD is making ASIC chips and processors for sapphire which will directly compete for the future mining operation.  Pricing this year didnt reflect on AMD because many people hooked up on the GME and AMC in the stock market. 

2) AMD is kicking Intel's butt. INTEL already lost it's the position in the global chip market, with AMD releasing new processors catered to only Gaming it's only a matter of time, AMD will dominate the chip market. 

3)

Technical standpoint AMD fall off from the $99 mark to 72 in 6 month's low on inflation. But AMD is one of those companies where it's Equity to dept ratio is high meaning, they have more business than they have debt. 

4) AMD is slowly building momentum in the smartphone processor market. Their processors are already 30-50% faster than the market's existing processors.

5) AMD's rival Nvidia is having hard time on the GPU market due to constant innovation and RND.

The parent company of Soho House which contains the Soho House worldwide clubs, Soho Works (read below), Electric Cinemas (these make AMC ones look like fun schoolgirl projects) their own furniture brand Soho Home, and glassware brand Barwell, in addition to offshoot clubs like The Ned in London‚Äôs Square Mile and Scorpios in Mykonos is headed to IPO on the NYSE under the ticker $MCG for a valuation of between $2b to $4b 

Some quick facts:

- The IPO will be overseen by JPM and Goldman

- But ‚ÄòWTF is soho house you retard?‚Äô I hear you ask: They are an exclusive members club for those working in the creative sector (but who also tend to be trust fund kids, bankers masking as art philanthropists - your average blue-armpit-hair Marxist artist isn‚Äôt paying $18 a cocktail but they‚Äôre always packed and getting a rooftop seat in London or New York is near impossible atm

- Their F&B margins are insane 

- Kim Kardashian has been rejected a membership over a dozen times

- haven‚Äôt turned a profit due to aggressive Goldman-backed expansion (see below): this year alone there will be openings in Rome, Tel Aviv, Brighton, Paris and London‚Äôs Strand just opened.

- they have recently made an incredible shift towards turning the membership into a digital socialising network for their members with 7-figure investments into their app alone that has clubhouse like features, noticeboards, video chat, and frankly a more useful social tool than boomer Facebook and other cancerous ‚Äòsocial‚Äô media apps: the idea being that since the members are all vetted (you need a proposer and a seconder to be granted membership) they are much more likely to reach out and socially engage with one a other 

- they have a WeWork competitor called Soho Works which is frankly nicer, cooler and more of a social status catch for trust fund kids working on their ‚Äòstartup‚Äô  than prime retard masayoshi son‚Äôs loss porn brand WeWork

- the principle holders are billionaire Ron Burkle, the founder Nick Jones, and British entrepreneur and CEO of caprice holdings, Richard Caring.

- Goldman Sachs is placing a big bet on the growth of Soho House, with a $770m (¬£560m) loan to further allow for aggressive expansion 

- it‚Äôs so private your wife can meet all her boyfriends there and since photography is prohibited you can still hold your head high in your community 

- Profits at Soho House soared 23% to ¬£31.7m in 2016 revenues up by a similar margin to ¬£273.6m.

- Turnover jumped again in the first half of 2017 by 28%, buoyed by new openings

- They made ¬£293 million (approximately $411 million) in revenues in 2019, about half of which originated from food and drink revenues and 20 percent from recurring payments by members. The rest originated from housewares.

- it‚Äôs very pandemic/crisis proof because of being able to draw down on waitlists, according to the FT: ‚ÄúSoho House has been able to continue its aggressive expansion through a mixture of cost cuts, fundraising and incoming membership fees.

‚ÄúOur membership model is pretty robust through a serious crisis,‚Äù said Mr Jones, who reckoned that the lengthy wait to become a member ‚Äî up to 18 months in some cases ‚Äî put people off cancelling.‚Äù

He also told CITY A.M.; ‚Äòif the business needed more money post-pandemic, it would let in its ‚Äúhuge‚Äù waiting list of 50,000 people.‚Äô

- because of this current members are also reluctant to give up their membership because it‚Äôs so difficult to get in to start with

Hello Apes, I'm taking off my fundamentals hat on these two stocks to discuss technicals and an opportunity that has presented itself with all of the criteria flashing green. I loaded up on both of these stocks for the tendies inbound. Let's review the criteria that are flashing green first:

1. The number of shares short should be greater than five times average daily volume
2. Shares short as a percentage of the float should be greater than 10%
3. Number of shares short should be increasing

""The number of shares short should be greater than five times the average daily volume"" Below in the first screenshot shows the short volume $18,900,000 with a 14.60 - 16.00% short ratio which is currently the 5th most shorted stock behind AMC, GME, RUN and NUAN per [Finachill.com](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today). The short interest is increasing every month and is up double since April.

&#x200B;

The last couple of days volume has been extremely low putting shares shorted about 3.82x of the last 6 days of daily volume in the screenshot below that I calculated in excel.

This is the perfect time to catch the hedge funds sleeping because average 90 day volume is around 10M but it has been cut in half recently which is why $RKT is primed to repeat history next week. With short interest increasing with a decreasing volume they will get caught sleeping as this data lags real time data which is just under 5x following this trend.

Lastly there is significant support in the options market due to the large interest in OTM calls for the 06/25 date to blow this stock past the resistance level of $21-$22 & $25.

&#x200B;

Once it passes the $21-$22 price it has support to get the $25 strike in the money and it's game over  all over again as the shorts will be forced to cover over $25 igniting the Rocket into orbit.

$UWMC short interest has been on the decrease as I'm sure the hedge funds have seen it trending in WSB so they have retreated to safety but they will be back quickly. I would recommend taking the tendies from this $RKT after lift off and then we reload and wait for the same indicators to flash for $UWMC the week after and catch the hedge funds sleeping twice!

7/5/21 01:07,"$PATH UiPath bullish move, not the moon but‚Ä¶at least $80. 15% move coming Got my crayons out again...after technical analysis on $NIO and $PLTR looking like it is working out I thought I would come back with this $PATH UiPath, let's go.

UiPath has been steadily working it's way from all time highs of $90 to sit at $70 right now (down 22%). This is a critical point and in my opinion will begin the reversal and show bullish momentum in the coming weeks.

There have been a few bearish articles about the stock but from a technical setup this looks like it has just broken out of the descending pattern and if it holds the $68/ 69/ 70 mark a golden cross of moving averages (1/2hr chart) would be imminent. It is currently holding the 50MA on the 2hr chart and a hold of this support level and consolidation at this point is key.

Worth noting if you are following Cathie Wood, Ark own 2.38% and UiPath has a 1.42% weighting in there funds (see below). Further they have been buying the stock since the stocks IPO around 21st April and have bought on the 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30th of this month around 3m shares. I'm not really interested when ARK overinvest in something at highs but when they invest heavy in something at lows I get curious for example IONS and BLI have been great calls.

First profit at $76. Stop loss at $67.9

Thoughts?

Potential for WSB APEs to get on this and ride a quality stock back up.

Who is with me? Worth waiting on a slight pullback before buying heavy but this will no doubt move.

If you aren't already in AMC, BB etc you might want to consider this play. In the lead up to next quarter this could be an underrated stock that has fallen under the radar. Thoughts?

How do I insert those moon and rocket symbols??

After making roughly 30% on my AMC play (thanks Apes) I have decided to do my first YOLO with a modest $12,500 and have chosen to drop it in DHCA. I purchased 1,256 shares at roughly $9.80 all based on the fact I‚Äôm trying to get ahead of the rush (I got in AMC in the high 40s) DHCA is currently in talks with FreeWire for a SPAC merger. Under president Biden‚Äôs infrastructure plan (let‚Äôs not go down the political road we just want tendies) the US is planned to build 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030. In comparison there are under 150,000 gas stations currently in the US. This is a quick play for me, if the SPAC goes through I envision this thing being like ChargePoint (CHPT) currently trading in the low $30s.

7/3/21 04:10,"RIG: Revised DD with new Technical Outlook Hello fellow traders,

I previously submitted a DD for RIG and feel that I need to update the DD based on the recent price action.

Previously DD:

With 14% short, which accounts for 74.9 Million shares currently being shorted on this stock. Past 6 months, the Transocean director paid 40.7 million from June 7 to June 22 to purchase 9.9 million shares on the open market, which along with a rising oil price, could potentially be another AMC in the making.

Shorts: Currently there are 569 million shares floating with 7.5% held by insiders, 54.52 held by institutions,s and well over 14% short of float, which accounts for almost 75 million shares of outstanding shares. Given the rising oil price and domestic market recovery, there is an increase in the demand, in addition to the cyclical summer demand for gas.

Insider: Insiders have been scooping up shares, which is an indication of confidence in the stability of oil prices and demand moving forward. ""Transocean director Frederik W. Mohn paid $40.7 million from June 15 through June 22 for a total of 9.9 million shares, a per-share average price of $4.11. Mohn made the purchases through Perestroika AS, a Norwegian investment firm of which he is the sole director and owner, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perestroika now owns 77.6 million Transocean shares. **It was Mohn‚Äôs first purchase of Transocean stock on the open market since 2018**.""

Technical Outlook: Resistance at $4.81 as a 52-week high. Currently, the stock is looking to break out and breakthrough that resistance. I expect the stock will go higher and potentially retest the $4.81 as the new support and then reaches new highs. Next potential resistance at $7.00 range and then at each dollar mark, roughly. However, if short squeezed, the stock price could increase exponentially.

Revised technical outlook:

Tuesday:

Price action on Tuesday, there was a spike of volume and price that hit an interim 52-week high of 4.86, which was above the previous $4.81. Obviously, it got smacked down after reaching that new high thereafter.

&#x200B;

Wednesday was not meaningful

Thursday:

Thursday got interesting in the first 15 minutes, the price spike to $5.07 with heavy volume, approximately 10 million shares during that 15 minutes span and broke through the previous $4.81 resistance and trying to establish that as the new support line, which held several times throughout the day.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/azqh6nywzt871.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d45496d648a945aa6d883d0473000c873caa795

Friday:

Today is another confirmation of that support through the day thus far and expect continued strength throughout the and expect the $5 as the first support line and $4.81 as the second support.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9aoux9kxzt871.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe0b502315cd3efffa9fb8c482556f0b5dfc4b31

Outlook:

I fully expect these volumes will continue to maintain with shorts starting to cover their outstanding floating shares as the price increases, which bold favorably for RIG. I expect the short% float will start to decrease from the current 14% and into the low single-digit since there is really no value for them to continue the short positions.  Honestly, how much lower can $5 go vs. the risk of stock going significantly upside.  This will also coincide with the increased demand on the oil price.  

Risk:

Geopolitical risk will be a factor in the oil price, which will definitely impact RIG's price.

Disclaimer: Currently I'm long RIG and looking for an entry point for a LEAP option play.

*Early 2021 Trading Restrictions*

Beginning on January 28, 2021, due to unprecedented market volatility and related portfolio margin demands imposed on RHS by the clearinghouse National Securities Clearing Corporation, RHS temporarily restricted or limited its customers‚Äô purchase of certain securities, including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., on our platform (‚ÄúEarly 2021 Trading Restrictions‚Äù).

We have become aware of approximately 49 putative class actions and three individual actions that have been filed against RHM, RHF, and/or RHS in various federal and state courts relating to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. The complaints generally allege breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and other common law claims. Several complaints further allege federal securities claims, federal and state antitrust claims and/or certain state consumer protection claims based on similar factual allegations. Approximately 18 of the putative class actions also name other broker-dealers and/or market makers as defendants. On February 5, 2021, certain plaintiffs filed a motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (""JPML"") to transfer and coordinate or consolidate the actions filed in connection with the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions into a multidistrict litigation in the Northern District of California (the ""Transfer Motion""). On March 1, 2021, we filed a response to the Transfer Motion, in which we supported transfer and coordination or consolidation of the actions into a multidistrict litigation in either the Northern District of California, or in the alternative, the Middle District of Florida. On April 1, the JPML entered an order centralizing the cases identified in the Transfer Motion into a multidistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the ‚ÄúTransfer Order‚Äù) captioned In re: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation, Case No. 21-2989-MDL-ALTONAGA/Torres (the ‚ÄúMDL‚Äù). On April 19, 2021, the court held an initial case management conference.

RHM, RHF, RHS and our Co-Founder and CEO, Vladimir Tenev, amont others, have received requests for information, and in some cases subpoenas and requests for testimony, related to investigations and examinations of the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions from the United States Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Northern District of California (""USAO""), the SEC staff, FINRA, the New York Attorney General‚Äôs Office, other state attorneys general offices, and a number of state securities regulators. Also, a related search warrant was executed by the USAO to obtain Mr. Tenev's cell phone. There have also been several inquiries based on specific customer complaints and with respect to employee trading. In addition, we have received information and testimony requests from certain committees and members of the U.S. Congress and Mr. Tenev has provided testimony with respect to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. We are cooperating with these investigations and examinations.

Due to the preliminary nature of all of these proceedings, we are unable at this time to estimate the likelihood or magnitude of any possible losses related to these matters.",50857,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.998797059,True

7/2/21 06:12,"A different kind of post - Classic narrative Lately a new narrative has taken over the interwebz.

Instead of investing in innovation and entrepreneurship, it is researching which stocks have heavy short interest and creating a movement to exploit this in order to create explosive growth.

The technique is clear and obvious.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Now onto the classic part of this post:

Every day I check a list of equities.  I don't pretend to think this is a great list or even a good list but it's my list hah

I first look at Tesla (I still think it is over valued but I like to see how it tracks).

I then look at Ride, NKLA, QS.  NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol

Then I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake.

Then I go to Nakd, and Fold.

Then I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola.  I weirdly like to look at Moderna.

Then I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme.

Then I check out Canopy.

Then BB, AMC, GME.

Then SLV, GLD.

Then Trillium, CRISPR.

Then onto the coins.

Then RKT and SPCE.

It is a weird routine I have each and every day almost.

I think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere.  

I think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is.

All in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world.  Also through google finance I get some good recommends on companies that I don't know about that maybe I will like based on that list and then I expand it sometimes.

Companies like CRISPR being the things I want to invest in for a better world.  Despite that I am not touching any of this shit with a 10 foot poll based on the pricing and our current market.

What equities would you add to look at and why.

I'd love to know what your lists are and the reasoning you like to track those particular sets of equities and such. :)

Let the shit throwing begin as I know many of you identify as apes but I still like to identify as the evolution known as human.",50878,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999701202,True
7/2/21 01:28,"Actual objective analysis on AMC Entertainment After hearing and seeing so much BS and one-sided opinions on AMC, thought I'd take a crack at some actual objective analysis on the company. 

Here's the crux of it:

What would you pay for AMC?

Well, a year ago, only 600m but what a difference a year makes as AMC is now trading at 29bn in market cap even though it has lost 3bn in income over the last 12mons as a result of the pandemic.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kylpw8v2m871.png?width=1325&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0387679e885ca0b3df26c443def82086fffc5f

You can make a case that AMC shouldn‚Äôt be valued based on backwards numbers as those were exceptional circumstances and at least in the near-term, their future is likely even brighter than pre-pandemic due to pent-up demand for a movie theater experience.

To keep it simple (my favourite principle), AMC was being valued at 2.1x enterprise value/trailing revenue pre-pandemic and assuming they have a blockbuster year this year that is 2x revenues versus pre-pandemic levels (ie., 10.6bn in revenues), even in that optimistic scenario they are trading at 3.7x enterprise value/forward revenue. Even if the average movie-goer goes 3x as often this next year as they‚Äôve done pre-pandemic because of a euphoric amount of pent-up demand, then AMC still trades at 2.5x enterprise value/forward revenue. While I promised to remain objective, I will subjectively add that when I ask myself if I‚Äôm going to watch 3x more movies this year, the answer as I look to my new big-screen TV is a quick no.

Clearly, valuation weighs more than just what will happen over the next year and if you think that the future for AMC will be brighter going forward then there could be a way to still justify valuation. I view the probability being higher that as demographics continue to age and alternatives like streaming become more attractive, theater traffic will continue to decline and that margins will continue to get squeezed. Yes, there are offsets like gaining market share but, in my experience, owning a larger piece of a declining pie is generally an area to avoid and certainly an area to avoid when valuation is a premium.

So, what would I pay for AMC? A reasonable value may be found by looking at AMC‚Äôs competitor, Cinemark, which is trading at 1.9x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue. This valuation acknowledges a worsening of trends for movie theaters post-pandemic than pre-pandemic. This is a quarter of the valuation that AMC is trading at ‚Äì 7.4x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue.

Does analysis matter at this point?

Probably not. If AMC can continue to dilute shareholders without consequence, then it would have limitless zero-cost capital to deploy and even a small return on this capital would make the company wealth creating as opposed to what it has been over time, wealth destroying.",50916,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.990278661,True

7/1/21 15:14,"$PLTR is a ticking time bomb *Pre-statements: Yes I have $AMC shares and calls. No, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so use this as you may :) Reasoning and DD is below****, but for people like me who sometimes don‚Äôt wanna read the whole post, I‚Äôm adding the summary first.*** 

Current $PLTR Holding: 492 shares, 5x $30 and 10x $28 weeklies and 2 x $30 calls expiring November 19th. 

# Summary

 I‚Äôm heavily invested in $PLTR shares for the long term because this time next year we should be over $100. **But weekly calls are the point of this post.**

I got a few $30 and $28 weekly calls on Monday, but I‚Äôm going hard on the $28+ weekly calls tomorrow since they‚Äôre now so cheap (Also for security I‚Äôm buying a few calls for the same strikes expiring next week too). Why? Because one little push and we‚Äôre breaking the last resistance wall at $27.50 and when we do we will be gapping back up to $45ish fast. We are all on the edge of our seats awaiting the FDIC contract news which should be announced any day now, and I believe that can be the final catalyst that pushes us into a hugeeee run like $SPCE last week. If that happens by Friday the weekly calls I get tomorrow will make me so much money! After all, we are about gambling, and this reward heavily outweighs the risks. 

# Now the boring stuff, my reasoning and DD:

**$Pltr one year chart:**

The entire chart is bullish. And if you look at it you can see it‚Äôs ready to break out at any moment. Once it does, it has a huge gap up to $45ish to fill. The last resistance is at $27.50 right now which we tested the other day. Once we break that I see a huge rally coming in. Also, we closed at $26.66 yesterday, when we closed there in January it dipped the next day, then ran to its ATH around $45 during the next 2 days. So far 2 out 3 of those things have repeated themselves, will all 3!?

**The Trillion dollar evaluations**

This is more debated in the MSM, but many say it will have a $1 trillion evaluation within the next 10 years. What sold me on it being probably true was when Seeking Alpha released an article saying there‚Äôs absolutely no way it‚Äôll happen üòâ Other analysts have written about why it is likely to happen, they lay it out plain and simple, and the ideas add up! 

**They continue to land huge contracts.** 

Left and right $PLTR is landing new partnerships and huge contracts. They‚Äôre one of the top companies working with the government and are constantly growing into new industries. The overall growth rate is amazing and speaks for itself. Also if we are awarded the FDIC contract, it means almost all banks will have to start using $PLTRs technology. 

***So either I‚Äôm gonna make a ton of money on these weeklies or just be really sad and pout all weekend.***",50951,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.991652429,True

6/29/21 17:58,"RIG - Supply and Demand for Oil and Recovery Play. Short DD Included Below  With 14% short, which accounts for 74.9 Million shares currently being shorted on this stock. Past 6 months, the Transocean director paid 40.7 million from June 7 to June 22 to purchase 9.9 million shares on the open market, which along with a rising oil price, could potentially be another AMC in the making.

Shorts: Currently there are 569 million shares floating with 7.5% held by insiders, 54.52 held by institutions,s and well over 14% short of float, which accounts for almost 75 million shares of outstanding shares. Given the rising oil price and domestic market recovery, there is an increase in the demand, in addition to the cyclical summer demand for gas.

Insider: Insiders have been scooping up shares, which is an indication of confidence in the stability of oil prices and demand moving forward. ""Transocean director Frederik W. Mohn paid $40.7 million from June 15 through June 22 for a total of 9.9 million shares, a per-share average price of $4.11. Mohn made the purchases through Perestroika AS, a Norwegian investment firm of which he is the sole director and owner, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perestroika now owns 77.6 million Transocean shares. **It was Mohn‚Äôs first purchase of Transocean stock on the open market since 2018**.""

Technical Outlook: Resistance at $4.81 as a 52-week high. Currently, the stock is looking to break out and breakthrough that resistance. I expect the stock will go higher and potentially retest the $4.81 as the new support and then reaches new highs. Next potential resistance at $7.00 range and then at each dollar mark, roughly. However, if short squeezed, the stock price could increase exponentially.

Using high quality materials and top of the line design, their furniture and recliners are known to be a lifetime purchase meant to satisfy all your comfort needs.

**Why LZB?**

[ The massive nut you‚Äôll get just from sitting in a LaZBoy recliner. ](https://preview.redd.it/5g6h3w7qw1871.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=56c36cd6cb254216e0d460e1b9c14b38d06b09a1)

There are several reasons why LZB is a good buy right now. Similar to GME and AMC in January, LZB has a relatively smaller market cap of around $1.75B. Over this past week it was up 6% until it dropped 3% at market close to end the day about 1.25% in the red. Every time this stock has dropped a few percent this year, it rebounded between **10%-20%**.

Nasdaq has also listed it as having a fair value of $53 by Nasdaq based on the average rating by several analysts. This would be a **43% estimated increase just to reach fair value**. This past week after earnings, $LZB dropped by nearly 12% indicating that a new rebound and ATH is nearby, with some potential swings.In a Nasdank article, $LZB was rated a strong buy at $42, yet it is near $37 now and being dumped well below it‚Äôs fair value. This is near a long term 6 month support of $36 and shows how undervalued $LZB truly is.

The June 15th earnings call also showed why $LZB has potential to grow a lot. They beat the estimated earnings by 12 cents, aka 16% of what was expected. Additionally, the trailing 12 month P/E ratio is 14.31 relative to the average 17 P/E ratio for most furniture companies and competitors. In the earnings call, it was mentioned that due to extremely high material costs currently and shortages of these items, the company is not able to make as much short term profit. But, this is being offset by increasing prices of their furniture. **This means that new homeowners who need to have furniture are paying whatever price $LZB sets, ensuring high profits and clearance of backlogged orders through the year.** Also, JPOW spoke on the same day of their earnings, causing them to sell off really fast for no reason.

[ I bet this is you right now you fat fuck. Make money of your lazyness. ](https://preview.redd.it/624026ixw1871.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=01826673909ab46b464b4745c08d83d20023419a)

**Price Action:**  Like I mentioned before, $LZB has some crazy price action.

https://preview.redd.it/dfgufqm1x1871.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=eada9626f290d948842b5c0a5e1d240d9e35f0a2

As of now, despite beating earnings, providing guidance for long term profitability, and expanding on its balance sheet. As can be seen here, after each drop since early January, $LZB recovers and reaches a new ATH. Therefore, this recent drop makes no sense compare to what many articles and the CEOs guidance has stated.

**Lazy News:** So if you‚Äôre hellah lazy and don‚Äôt trust this DD, here are some quotes and references directly from the news and the Laziest CEO of all time:

The King of Lazy CEO noted the following in the earnings call:- For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird. Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

**Forbes also mentions the following:** If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy. By one measurement that the company uses, ‚Äúwritten same-store sales‚Äù for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

**Other Financials:** La-Z-Boy last announced its earnings data on June 14th, 2021. The reported $0.87 EPS for the quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimates of $0.74 by $0.13 or about 16%. The firm had revenue of $519.50 million for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $498.53 million. Its quarterly revenue was up 41.4% on a year-over-year basis. La-Z-Boy has generated $2.62 earnings per share over the last year and currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6.

**Conclusion (TLDR)**: $LZB is primed for a gap up after breakout earnings . It has a low P/E ratio, good estimated earnings, and a strong following given its reputation of having the comfiest furniture on the market. I will be monitoring the price closely and until then, I have listed my positions below as well. This is not financial advice.

That being said, I do believe tomorrow will be a great day for Purple and I also believe that the current price is a good entry. Everyone needs a bed, and with all the new GME and AMC millionaires on WSB there will be a ton of kids moving out of mom's basement and needing a new mattress. As always, be conservative- Shares, leaps and short puts is what I have been playing. Shares is always the play as you can hold them forever. Options are for degenerates. I am not expecting a major move tomorrow, but I do expect good upward movement from now until growth plateaus, which could be 5+ years.

The DD is pretty straightforward:

5 years ago purple did 65M in revenue, this year that number is expected to approach 900M, 2020 they did about 650M. The company has about 40M in debt, which is tiny compared to its peers. The net income shown on the graph is mostly due to warrant accruals and a whole bunch of accounting black magic that is finally being cleaned up. u/indonesian_activist please shed some light on this.

&#x200B;

PRPL expects to be the number 2 player in the indsutry within 3-5 years and in that same time frame they expect sales to approach 1.5-2B. Let me spell that out for you.  They are anticipating growing from 65M in sales in 2016 to 2B by 2026. **This represents a 40%+ CAGR**

Also, PURPLE just locked in more manufacturing capacity in Georgia???? Why lock in more capacity when the plant is barely getting started. You Don't lock in manufacturing capacity like this without very good reason to believe you will continue to grow.

7/8/21 02:43,"$AMC short trap today and $100 is very likely next week. Looking closely, I think AMC today's action is a big short trap.  More people will expect AMC to hit $30 to fill the gap below.  However, AMC seemed to bounced off long term trend line ( as shown) very nicely.  If this strong trend line hold, I'm seeing AMC above $100 next week.

To be more specific, so many people drew the bull flag and see support at $50.  Because it broke $50, shorters are more encouraged and add more positions.  I think $41.5 is the real support as shown in the chart.

Also, the way $SPY being very shaky this week, I think it will broke down sometimes this week and early next week. Once all the smart money get out of SPY stocks, with all that cash, they will pour into meme stocks once more. This scenario is very likely imo.

7/6/21 21:06,"Let me clear the air here regarding GME, AMC, & CLOV Alright you retards, I'm taking the initiative to clear the air. I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here.

We are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.

GME, AMC, & CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.

**GME** \- Was being shorted because as per ""technicals"" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.

**AMC** \- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors ""Picking"" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.

**CLOV** \- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.

Yes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.

All 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.

WSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion.

If you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC).

Now with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.

Don't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved.

Everyone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.

BB and NOK became ""Meme"" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future.

People just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.

Also, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).

Some plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.

WSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idgaf.

**Important update**: I want to say thanks to everyone for the awards, upvotes and comments.

I want to clarify some FUD here after the traction from this post. When I was referring to \~15-20% short sellers for GME I **was not** referring to short interest or the ""naked"" shorts everyone is talking about. Simply, that the original short sellers that are still in their positions haven't closed out their positions yet, same goes for AMC, and the big MOASS that everyone is mentioning is not what I meant when I said gamma squeeze or short squeezes. I was simply referring to when GME spiked to $438 and months after again to $330. I wasn't talking about the big MOASS.

I've been on WSB since December 2020 but only joined on January 28th, 2021 when I felt like I wanted to start to contribute myself. I was here before there was 500k members. I used to only use reddit to view posts and discussion and never really felt the need to create an account until I found stock/investment subreddits etc. Hopefully this clears some shit up. Again, the purpose of this post was to explain why these 3 stocks are not the same and shouldn't be compared to each other and for people to stop shilling others and having this ""cult"" like attitude/behaviour.

Oh! and the reason why my post mentions GME, AMC, CLOV is because it was the 3 top tickers on the thread for the day this post was made, 07/06/2021.

Looking at the 2y chart, the price is extremely far extended above the 200 day moving average. And the MACD for the 20 and 200 is at an extreme level. Then on Friday we broke below the lower bound of a wedge. This all points to a big near term pull back. 

How many retards out there are still holding and praying?   

I think we can see a mid 20$ print in the next 30 days.

7/4/21 20:03,"If the DD involves a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù‚Ä¶ ignore it. Stop. Get help. Learn to use your brain. I‚Äôm just an autist that wants to help my fellow dudes make money. Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you‚Äôll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. 

Turns out, you‚Äôll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. 

AMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we‚Äôve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It‚Äôs over. 

Why should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. 

Or actually, don‚Äôt stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don‚Äôt have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife/girlfriend however is invited. 

So, want to know why your ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù DD isn‚Äôt working?! Here‚Äôs the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It‚Äôs gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. 

So is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here‚Äôs some facts for ya- they don‚Äôt need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They‚Äôre not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can‚Äôt get them on board, and the stock isn‚Äôt a household name, then you fucked up. 

So this is what I‚Äôm saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. 

Come on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. 

TL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. 

Fucking rookie ass bitches.

EDIT MOTHERFUCKERS- 

Somehow my rant, which I thought would get me banned or downvoted to hell, has made it to the top in just a few hours. 

Sure, the comments are trying to wreck me. I also got a Reddit admin notice asking if I need mental health help lmao. Got a good chuckle out of that one. Fucking trolls. 

But you can see this is a place where we can still say fuck this short interest bullshit. And we can still find others who agree. I‚Äôm ok with conflict as long as nobody gets banned or their comments deleted. 

When you try to have a counter opinion on most subreddits you get insta-banned. So I‚Äôm just happy we have some freedom to talk shit here and disagree openly. It‚Äôs fun. Appreciate it you cunts. 

I know it won‚Äôt stop the shilling but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Let‚Äôs get some real fucking DD in here. Fuck short squeezes. It‚Äôs too easy for people to come in and manipulate this crowd on SI news.

7/19/21 23:31,"Observations of an AMC theater. I went to the movies this weekend at an AMC theater here in my medium sized city (currently ranked the 3rd best place to live in the United States) and I observed a few things.

1. On a Saturday night at 7:00 pm while some new popular movies are out the parking lot was about 1/8 full.

2. There was no one working the box office selling tickets, you could only buy tickets from the automated machine, there were two of these machines and one was out of printer paper so you couldn‚Äôt use it.

3. There was no one taking tickets to get into the theater, AT ALL, you literally could have just walked into any movie carrying anything.

4. The 7:00 movie we saw had a grand total of 22
People in it.

5. The tickets with tax were 24$ and a regular popcorn and regular soda was 15$, so nearly 40$ for two people to go to a movie (cheaper to stream it from home)

This is a doomed business unless something drastically changes. People are streaming from home for cheaper.  Black widow box office numbers are way down because of streaming.

I will
Be surprised if AmC still exist in a couple years 

Apes be careful!! The fundamentals may still be there for a big squeeze, but get in, make some money and get out.

Down vote me, call me a hedgie fud spreader whatever you gotta do, I‚Äôm just telling you unemotional observations.

I bought in at 10$ and sold 75% of my shares at 60$ but am still holding.

I mean, this is an old-fashioned value play stock for the longs.  If YOLOing your kidneys is more your style than know it also has a high short interest position on relatively small float.  Revenue has been increasing every quarter and while profits are slim they too are growing every quarter.  No one wants to buy a fish or a gerbil or a bearded dragon online.  I feel like the prejudice against brick and mortars has become irrational, some things have to transact in meatspace, and Petco is the uncontested dominant player for Pets and Pet supplies.  People take their dogs to the pet store to let them pick out their own toys and treats.  

As every Redditor knows, those cat pictures won't take themselves.  I feel like it is a good fit for us.  Fundamentals and an. unreasonable short position aren't enough though.  You need that extra something special the apes can get behind.  GME = fuck ya video games, AMC = Nerds like Marvel movies, WOOF = because Boba and Bubblegum need their skweeky-dings.

7/17/21 22:37,"SPCE Soft TA - When Will the Pain End? What's up fellow retards,

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, relative volatility index, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (second upper and lower purple lines), known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level. I generally use this to find stocks that are trading above +2 deviations to short/buy puts or at -2 deviations to buy calls/stock as these areas represent only 5% of the price action over a given time period and statistically, there's a 95% chance the price will drop back below or climb back above +2/-2 deviations, respectively. I did this with Amazon puts recently -  [https://imgur.com/VsKQbhS](https://imgur.com/VsKQbhS)

See my Previous SOFI and AMC, and AMZN, NVDA etc. TA's if you want examples of how this strategy works.

NOW LET'S GET INTO SOME CHART PORN FOR SPCE!!!

Here are our One Year and 6 Month Deviation Support and Resistance lines for SPCE -  [https://imgur.com/FmCo3OU](https://imgur.com/FmCo3OU)  \- Save it to your comp to open the full sized image.

This week was rough, SPCE broke through its One Year and 6 Month +1 Deviation support, then broke through its long term regression/mean trend line (middle line), and has seemed to want to cross some minor support around (-).5 deviations (dotted line on 6 month chart) in the immediate future.

So, where should you be looking to add positions?

The most important and nearest support deviation trend line available to us at this point is -1 deviations (bottom blue line) on both the one year and 6 month chart at around $26 and $25. This is where we will encounter some serious long term trending support deviation levels and will likely see bulls try to bounce the price off these two price levels as less selling pressure comes in. Furthermore, our relative volatility index is around 25 on the one year chart, and on the 6 month, we can see what's known as a ""divergence"" forming on relative volatility as the price continues to drop yet the index is slowly rising and is around 43 right now -  [https://imgur.com/J7wlSNo](https://imgur.com/J7wlSNo)

Should we cross -1 deviation, our next nearest support levels are at $14-16 price levels of -2 deviations on one year and the 6 month chart. This is statistically the safest buy zone for those who are extremely bearish on the stock and want to buy in or cover their short. However given the strong fundamentals of the company we will likely see some strong support forming at our -1 deviation support levels and hopefully a break out to the upside regression trend of $35-37 in the coming weeks once we bottom out.

It should be noted that we have some slight support around $30 at (-).5 deviations (white dotted line) on the 6month chart, but it seems like the price is already making its move down to our next deviation support levels -  [https://imgur.com/eNFOSPS](https://imgur.com/eNFOSPS)

Good luck to everyone out there, buy that dip if we can hit support in the next week. Peace !",51692,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999813259,True

So WSB consists only of true retards. From what I‚Äôve gathered if you want to cement yourself as a real WSB baller then you yolo meme stocks and buy shitty calls that will never print. This you already know. WSB has turned to more fuckery day in and day out. In some way we are all drawn to it. If we can‚Äôt get off on what stocks to push then at least we can get the best advice in the world on all other shit in life. Hookers, sex, love, Cramer, weed, and oh yeah stocks. In some way this is our way of life. Our escape from reality. We love being apart of something and to us apes this is our playground of fun. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve bought high and sold low because of you fucking retards. I literally believe in my balls that this is how you buy stocks. Why the fuck would anyone listen to you assholes on here? I‚Äôve looked at so many stupid charts and graphs and I‚Äôm way too retarded to understand that shit and apparently the rest of you are too. 

The days of GME and AMC were long before I became a member of WSB. Those days seem to be over and new product has taken its place. So many different stocks are being pushed and none of them seem to be worth shit. It‚Äôs easy to jump on what‚Äôs doing well because that‚Äôs what all you retards do. I‚Äôm guilty too because I do that same whack shit too. Fucking something about rockets and ape emojis that I just can‚Äôt stay away from. So we do it. We hate ourselves. We love ourselves but at the end of the day we just want to make money. We are all just as greedy and miserable as the hedge funds we fight. We want to see that green dildo rocket so high that we literally lose track of life. That‚Äôs why all our wives have boyfriends and why we will all drive lambos some day. 

So in the end I hope this posts. I hope I have enough shitty karma or whatever else the fuck you need to be cool enough to post on here. I know there are people just like me who wanna make an awesome shitpost on WSB. This is for you to hopefully show you it is possible if your drunk and high and down 50% on your stocks. Thanks for advice retards. I look forward to continue losing money with you all. üöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çüåïüåï

TL:DR
Get all your advice from WSB and no where else. 

Much love signing off. See you at lambo.

Mods I am too retarded to give the shitpost flair or maybe I‚Äôm not allowed to shit post on weekdays so I listed it as TA. Please change it or just delete as this was my attempt. Thank you!!",51841,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.999679089,True
7/15/21 14:18,"AMC Options Analysis - Open Interest ITM - Puts = $1.55B Calls = $0.65B Don't buy the dip unless you're retarded.

**For in-the-money options: there is $1.55B of open puts vs $0.66B open calls (as of 7/14/21 close).**

Today, I compiled all open interest of AMC calls and puts. The total amount of open contracts for calls/puts are roughly similar. However, the distribution of open in-the-money contracts are highly in-favor for puts. Below you will find the summary by total, expiration dates, and strike price. Data is current as of 7/14/21. My source and calculations are below.  Feel free to question my assumptions. I am not a financial advisor. Do not take my advice. I am a f\*cking retard.

7/15/21 13:10,"For AMC the Hedgefunds are not the real predators and have been waiting to post this I am going to be real honest on this but the real scum bags on this AMC stuff isn‚Äôt the hedgefunds it‚Äôs the youtubers, influencers, and Redditors trying to get likes, clout, shares, followers, views, subscribers, etc. 

I have been watching and reading shit for more than a month about dark pools, hidden shorted shares, manipulation, APE NATION, bullish wedge, 10 percent down but a good sign, failure to delivers, the real price, etc. 

Just want to throw this out here and say a lot of people got screwed because they are listening to all this and these people are making these videos and posts to get you connected to their account for their own benefit. YouTubers that post 2 times a day to talk AMC got ridiculous amount of likes and subs which grows their channel. Never saw their position, if the were still holding or even if they had one. They took advantage for their own gain and everybody fell for it. Guarantee there were some that believed in this and all this theory stuff and had positions but again screw those people too that dragged AMC holders a long and gave them hope trying to profit on their shares. 

In the end, this is WSB and love the dumb shit people do on this sub and the gains people make and AMC was awesome for me from $14 to $50 and got out. But people need to know heggies were not the predators on this it was the people that were taking advantage of retail investors and brainwashing them and making ‚ÄúAPE NATION‚Äù a thing and saying $100,000 a share is the floor if you hold. 

Sincerely, 
Chris Hanson (To Catch a Predator)

Edit: Based on these comments just need to throw this out here. I am not saying AMC is gonna go down and don‚Äôt have any slack in the game on this. I just want people that are still holding or held for a month to know that people are making money off this in other ways and are taking advantage of the situation. I hope retail makes money on AMC and if it goes to hell blame yourself and the people that you follow.

7/15/21 12:28,"ONCE WERE AUTISTS. I truly HATE what has happened to WSB due to the whole FUCKING meme stock revolution.

Instead of just being happy with ourselves for unexpectedly making bank with TSLA, AMC, GME, et al, many of us thought we were suddenly geniuses.

And many of those who weren't IN on those parties the first time wanted to be THE NEXT TIME!!

We also got a reputation in the Media for thinking outside the box AND acting in CONCERT to MOVE STOCKS. (In other words something very close to PUMPING!)

The sub got FLOODED with new people, many of whom were just plain GREEDY and/or STUPID, and many of whom broke the rules. Who weren't FUNNY. Who didn't have anything of value to share. Who wanted just to PUMP their own stock. Or to find out WHAT was the new meme, because they were too lazy to learn anything first, and then pump THAT!  Mods were busy night and day trying to keep it reasonable.

All other interesting and often very valuable discussions started to subside. And with them, a very WONDERFUL, and rare good-humor. After calling each other names, we actually REACHED OUT WITH KINDNESS to those of us who were experiencing loss or some other trouble. Increasingly, to me at least, it has become less kind, and interesting, and a lot more venal.

In the last few days, have you seen what is happening to the AMC subs? Its partisans are all on an **ALEX JONES-LEVEL** **CRUSADE** against all the ***imaginary enemies*** that are ***secretly manipulating*** the prices downward. **NEVER MIND THE STOCK WAS $1.92** on January 1st for good reasons, and could reasonably be expected to return to earth at some point...NOoooo!

There were 'investigative reports' about illegal naked shorts and fake shares. People started taking it all WAY TOO  SERIOUSLY. They put their student loan money on it, they could barely wait for Friday so they could put their checks on it.  One guy used the fact that he needs to take care of his handicapped mom to put ALL of his money on it.  It now is an ALL OUT WAR against some fuck named Kenny who is supposedly masterminding all this evil. And the only way to fight it is to BUY **MORE** of the **SAME TANKING MEME STOCK!!**  **BRILLIANT!!**

First of all, it's NOT a conspiracy. Or if it is, we should acknowledge that WE ALSO ARE A CONSPIRACY, okay?  But even if it were, how is it effective to just SIT THERE AND LET THEM KEEP CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU??!! I mean, the more you prove you can't win, the more you should just LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME, No? But I am actually worried somebody is going to get HURT  by this. It's TOO SERIOUS,  GUYS. IT HAS TO STOP!!    **I don't want**  **Sept 11 NIHILISM IN MY SUBREDDIT, OKAY?!**

Here's what I think...we need to stop being the fucking 'meme stock promoter people' and go back to being the 'hidden opportunity exploiters', the class clowns, the ne'r do wells, etc.

I'm pretty much a permabear anyway and don't try to hide it, but I get yelled at, banned, and called a 'shill' and a lot worse for trying to INFORM PEOPLE who are not experienced that **WE ARE NOT HERE TO ENDLESSLY PROMOTE MEME STOCKS whose time has GONE.**

So, I PROPOSE we start DELIBERATELY SHORTING meme stocks or buying puts on them. I've made like 60% on my admittedly tiny portfolio in the last 2 days with puts on AMC. I'M  GONNA START RUBBING IT INTO YOUR GREEDY APE ASSES, TOO!!

Which reminds me.  I am kinda SICK of this WHOLE APE motif, too. It's so OVER-DONE. **Fuck,  when did we vote for THAT!?** Now all the media is calling us that. Okay, you idiots that want to pretend you are too dumb to care about the valuation of stock but want to call anybody who disagrees with you a SHILL, You be the APES!!  I don't even remember what we were BEFORE. OH YEAH....WE USED TO BE AUTISTS, REMEMBER?

But would we stay on the NEWS, with CNBC counting how many times we mentioned 'blubber' if they had to refer to us a AUTISTS??  NOOOO!! Chad and Veronica would WRITE ANGRY EMAILS to REDDIT. No, we had to TONE IT DOWN. So we became nice, SOFT, friendly apes. Lots of poo and banana joke material there. AH HAHAHAHAHA!! So VERY funny, those apes.

I want Bears, Shorts and AUTISTS to have EQUAL RESPECT. Do you hate Hedge Funds?  GREAT!!! Make a case for us SHORTING THEM and maybe we will do it.  But don't get your damn knickers in a twist if I don't give a shit about your grandma not being able to afford a new colostomy bag because I refuse to help pump your fucking worthless meme stock, **ASSHOLE!!**

And if your being TOO DUMB to understand that WHAT GOES UP MUST **EVENTUALLY** GO TITS UP, then good riddance, Monkey Boy!!  FUCK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH!!",51848,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.694382429,True

Finally, I realized theres another golden opportunity for me. The opportunity is to short the f out of robinhood when it comes out. I think robinhood is going to be the most hated stock and I simply hate the stock.

7/15/21 09:26,"Why AMC and GME price tanked By Sin√©ad Carew

(Reuters) -Shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment and video game retailer GameStop Corp fell sharply on Wednesday and were both trading below half their recent peak prices, testing the fortitude of the stocks' retail shareholders.

AMC, in its fourth straight day of losses, closed down 15% at $33.43, close to 54% below its all-time high of $72.62 reached in early June. The stock earlier fell as low as $33.25 to its lowest point since June 1.

GameStop finished down 6.9% at $167.62 after hitting a session low of $165.07, compared with its June 8 high of $344.66. GameStop, which hit a record high of $483 in late January, also registered a fourth straight day of declines.

The companies have been at the center of epic rallies in so-called meme stocks that have captivated Wall Street, hurt bearish hedge funds and raised the profile of retail investors. Both are still sitting on big year-to-date gains. AMC was still up 1,476% so far in 2021 while GameStop was up 789% for the year to date.

Their recent declines may test the individual investors that have purchased their shares in recent months, often touting their buys on sites such as Reddit's popular WallStreetBets.

""When things are going up it's easy to get on board,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. ""It could go significantly lower because there's less interest in the trade. People hate to lose money much more than they love to make money.""

The decline in AMC shares came even after a strong weekend at the box office, when Walt Disney Co and Marvel's superhero adventure movie ""Black Widow"" captured $80 million in the biggest opening weekend for a movie since the pandemic.

Dollarhide noted that Disney also generated $60 million globally from selling the movie on its direct-to-consumer streaming service, which competes with movie theaters.

The COVID-19 pandemic kept theaters and other businesses shuttered for months. Concerns about the surge in cases of the latest COVID-19 variant may be exacerbating declines in so-called reopening stocks such as AMC, according to MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler.

""It's a stock that was trading up very high because it was a momentum trade and when the momentum dries up a little bit it comes down,"" Handler said.

For the full year 2021, AMC is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of $3.16 on revenue of $2.41 billion. For its fiscal year ending in January 2022, GameStop is expected to report a loss per share of $0.56 on revenue of $5.57 billion. Estimates for both companies were collected by Refinitiv. As of Tuesday's close, about 78 million shares of AMC, or almost 16% of its float, were sold short, according to the latest estimate from S3 Partners. That compares with 75 million shares sold short as of June 30.

About 8.68 million shares in GameStop, or 14.9% of its float, was sold short as of Tuesday's close, compared with 8.22 million on June 30, according to S3.

7/15/21 07:44,"WTF Anchor? Why the fuck? This is long. Tl;dr why the fuck is Anchor holding my AMC winnings for over 2 weeks?

I earned a modest $200 on AMC last month (bought low and held!) So on Monday June 28, I initiated transfer to Chase. Said it'd clear by Thursday July 1.

During those days, I transferred around some non-stock currency with money already in the system, not part of what I was withdrawing. Anchor sometimes gives you currencies from companies for taking quizzes, and that's all the money I have invested for that type of gig - nothing *mine*. It has almost nothing to do with this issue I'm having. 

July 2nd, Friday, my withdraw from AMC was canceled by them.


My message: Why was my transfer to my bank account canceled? It was supposed to be in my account yesterday. I'm level 3 verified.


Reply: it's a lengthy bs response about changing requirements--- 

We have marked your withdrawal as canceled and returned funds to your account balance due to the migration that we recently had from our trust partner to a new banking partner.

I also wanted to give you an update on the process for bank withdrawals.

Due to updated regulatory guidance, our banking partner is mandating enhanced verification procedures for all future bank transactions.
If you have already provided both the front and back of your ID, it is likely that no further action is needed from you at this time (we will reach out if there was an issue validating the images). However, if you previously only provided the front of your photo ID during verification, you would need to upload it again now with front and back due to the new requirements.

We are in the process of rolling out updates to our mobile applications to allow providing front and back of ID. In the meantime you can utilize our website portal:
https://dashboard.anchorusd.com/register/image

We understand that this comes amid an unacceptable bank withdrawal delay that has affected you, as we have worked through this updated guidance. Please understand that we take this incredibly seriously and have been working around the clock to address it, both with our current partner and by bringing onboard backup providers for funds processing. Once you have submitted the front and back of your photo ID, your bank withdrawal will process in accordance with the standard 2-3 business day processing time.


So that was July 2. As I'd mentioned in my first email, I'm level 3 verified, which requires front and back of my ID so none of this should even apply to me. Not only that, but if they didn't have the back of the card, they clearly stated in this email that they'd reach out to me if there were any issues. There didn't. 

They also put in their first reply something about pending currenct shit that has already been cleared and both sent to USDC, per THEIR suggestion, so I could transfer USDC to coinbase and cash out that way, effectively forcing me to use their crip options. 


So last night, I tried moving my USDC wallet to coinbase and got the red warning of *crips haven't cleared yet, you need at least $15.79 remaining in account to transfer"". I'll take this time to share that, on July 2, I WAS able to move $40 to my other wallet. 

I haven't TOUCHED the app since June 28 for either stonks or currencies so this will clear up without more bullshit. 

Last night, I tried moving 160 over, that way I'm covered for supposed pending currencies, and got the red warning ""you can only transfer $5 due to pending transactions.""

WHAT PENDING TRANSACTIONS? I HAVEN'T TOUCHED A THING.


I email last night: I have been trying for almost 3 weeks to get funds from my account to my bank. The message says i have things pending so i can't move my money. I have nothing pending. You're holding my money hostage over nothing.


Their reply: Thank you for reaching out. I understand that you may be having issues with moving your funds/crip around due to the pending deposits ( 2021-06-29¬† $15.00 for 3.9575 ANT)
which has not cleared and made since the 17th of June.

Just to give you an update, we are still working on resolving this issue and I will reach out using this ticket number once we have an update.

I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you.


To be clear here, the ANT transfer was free currency for quizzes taken, and sent to USDC on 6/29 with my AMC wins. A second crip was submitted at the same time and wasn't mentioned in this email, so it must have cleared?

Regardless, I resubmitted my ID today, despite having done so last month and not receiving any messages about resubmitting",51890,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.994207382,True

7/14/21 08:43,"Current State of $GME and $AMC - Unbiased Technical Analysis Had to post again because a sentence in my previous post caused it to be deleted.

I apologize in advance for not confirming anyone's bias - if that's what you are looking for stop reading now.

Some of you might know me from my previous AMC/GME analysis where I detailed the setup for the most recent runs:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nexq9s/gme\_ta\_big\_breakout\_today\_setup\_looks\_better\_than/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nexq9s/gme_ta_big_breakout_today_setup_looks_better_than/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I've been getting a lot of requests for this, and seen a **ton** of completely false technical analysis for these names, so I figured I would clear the air and provide an **unbiased** roadmap from someone with no position.

Let's dig into the charts -

[$GME 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/4mbrhsb7v1b71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e328ffbaf0c02398074e571f7e7c88ed860337c)

Starting with $GME, let's break it down color by color:

**(RED)**

Ascending triangle coming from upside. These are more likely to have a bullish outcome. However, this is on a longer timeframe. It would break up above **344** and targets **400 --> 450 --> 500.** You would want a daily close to seal the deal. This setup breaks down and is invalid below **163,** from there - no support until **145.**

**(TEAL)**

Descending channel coming from downside. This are bearish in nature. It means the near term trend is down and likely to stay that way unless we break above the upper boundary with a daily close. In this case, you would need a break above **209,** which would target **241.26, 274.29, 291.30 -** and **maybe** the top of the pattern at **344.** Until then, it is sell the rip short term.

When a pattern breaks against it's bias - the resulting move is often less pronounced and I look for about half the move I would look for if it broke with it's bias. That's why in this scenario, if we broke above, you would want to see it form a **bull flag, falling wedge, or ascending triangle (continuation pattern)** to get that true follow through to the far end.

This breaks down with the red setup below that **163** level.

(**YELLOW)**

These are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **291.30, 274.29, 241.26, 205.49, 189.66.** Below, they are resistance. Above, they are support. Under the pattern, support is **145.00, 100.00.**

Moving onto $AMC -

[$AMC 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/xn42mhw5v1b71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=7785ff88f6b50dedbc23436c5b235dad4ae3e759)

**(RED)**

With that large bounce on **7/8 -** this has actually become a **falling wedge.** These are **bullish** in nature. That being said, we are obviously in danger of breaking it down today. For that to not happen, we must hold **38.54** on every daily close, sloping down each day. Below, **the setup is invalid** and nearby support is at **36.77** and **33.61.**

The pattern breaks up on a daily close above **55.00** sloping down each day. Price targets for the breakout would be **65.10, 75.00, 100.00.**

**(YELLOW)**

These are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **65.10, 61.18, 51.00, 36.77, 33.61, 20.46, 16.79.** There is a few more but they are so far away there is no reason to plot them. I try to keep my charts as clean as possible.

Note the gap at **33.61 -** this is also one of the most important supports on the chart. Gaps like to be filled, and it's likely we do fill this one.

Remember a breakdown is always confirmed by a candle close on it's respective chart, in this case the daily. For that reason, we could see a candle wick under - fill the gap - wick back over. A close under that level would be very unhealthy and likely mark a move back to **20.46.** This is the highest probability point to go short.

This hot off the presses steaming pile of trash has it all: charts **and** text! With a side of **disappointment** and **shattered dreams**! All for the low price of wasting time you didn't need anyway!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 1. The Meme Demystified**

My basic thesis for the meme stocks is that they are all following a relatively similar, and somewhat predictable pattern. There was a recent post here that claimed all the meme stocks were totally different plays. This is wrong. In fact, they are all basically the same play, with some variation. Here is a list of the essential elements of the meme stock pattern:

&#x200B;

1. **Memes**: This just boils down to retail attention; DDs, memes, ppl posting stupid yolos, etc.
2. **Option wizardry**: Seeing there is a 'new thing' over on the ol' internets and it's going up, some big money motherfuckers starting buying call options in stupid quantities, forcing market makers to hedge, **the thing** then happens.
3. **Diamond handing**: A bunch of idiots catch a case of FOMO and pile into the stock at terrible prices, then once they're sitting on devastating losses, they say to themselves: 'you know I *always* believed in this company' and promptly declare they are diamond handed apes, and they'll *never* sell.
4. **Higher-low**: The refusal to sell by the ~~retards~~ brilliant new investors who see value that others don't, *causes* the rapidly falling stock price to stabilize at a new higher-low, proving the case that their diamond handing actually did something.
5. Go back to 1 and repeat for another leg higher.

&#x200B;

Looking at the charts in the next part, it's my contention that the higher-low should be at the same level the stock broke out of on the prior move. In other words: spike, drop to breakout, stabilize there, spike again, drop to second breakout, stabilize there, ... repeat until lambo.

SPCE is an example of a case were the stock fell all the way back down after it's early year breakouts, but I'm not sure it ever properly fit the pattern.

***There's no fucking pattern, dipshit. TA doesn't work on meme stocks! It's just randomness!!!!*** I hear you typing in your comment. I see a pattern in these moves. Further, the underlying mechanism of call option wizardry appears the same as well (GME, part 1, notwithstanding). As does the effect of diamond handing.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. The Meme Charts**

First, let me say the State of the Memes this week is **wounded**.  As the charts show, across the board (except SPCE) the whole of Memelandia got pretty well beat to shit.

Starting with GME:

[GME](https://preview.redd.it/ukgcqozlnma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3c70553d72942ff2d3e936e46239c6df908ef6)

GME has completed four rounds on the wheel of lambos. It is, like all the meme stocks, experiencing the early stages of a break down of the pattern. You can fiddle around with where you think Launch #4 should be drawn and put it around $195, then squint and turn you head a little to the right and everything will look just dandy.

Is GME dead? No. Just wounded. Get back up into the Support Zone #4 and it's game on.

&#x200B;

Next AMC:

[AMC](https://preview.redd.it/dbivb5gkoma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1766b652351e92f9201c28b4fef1031796eaaa32)

AMC is that weird kid you went to school with. He was nice enough, but it was always a little awkward to hang out with him. Like you were never quite sure what he was going to do/say next. The reason underlying this is likely the fact that y'all bought damn-near the whole company already.

Is AMC dead? No. It's a weirdo that I expect should drop all the way back to $14.54 before finding support. But at this point it could literally do anything. (Except go up again. That's definitely not happening until we get some kind of consolidation ... somewhere.)

&#x200B;

Everyone's favorite Canadian, BB:

[Oh, Canada!](https://preview.redd.it/6haay06epma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=52acbe79317f76bf4a9e43636c87a34890197c38)

Not too shabby, not too great. Like the last girl you took home from the bar. You didn't have to get *that* drunk to make the call, but you weren't going to pick her sober.

Is BB dead? No. We've broken under Support Zone #3 (or #2, if you don't want to count the Dec jump as a proper meme launch). However, we haven't completely collapsed, and if you know anything about TA, you know that you can just redraw the lines to reinforce that poorly thought out decision you made when you entered the position in the first place.

&#x200B;

Great bedside table selection, BBBY:

[I really like these bedside tables... that I got from Wayfair.](https://preview.redd.it/e0d1mj63qma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3cefbc8df2ff395550d482556355d6bc7f8fe17)

Nobody talks about this ticker any more, but it actually looks like its in the best shape of the bunch.

Is BBBY dead? Absolutely not. In fact, I'm thinking of using margin to hop aboard (cause almost all my money is tied up ~~bagholding~~ *with a long term investment in* CLOV). It found support this week right where it was supposed to and it ended the week with green candles. Maybe being forgotten about around here is a good thing.....

&#x200B;

Leprechaun 8, The Night of Broken Dreams, CLOV:

[I might have to visit a church..... how much do favors from Jesus cost, anyway?](https://preview.redd.it/9swz2j03rma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6333324df38e3cf30320f0b63f85547e0caead6)

I'm really, really, *really*, hoping my thesis that the price needs to stabilize at the previous breakout point is wrong. Or that I'm drawing the breakout lines wrong. Or that Buddy Jesus is going to forgive me for all those hookers and all that cocaine. I'm sorry, okay!

Is CLOV dead? No, but it just got kicked straight in the nuts and is lying on the ground writhing in pain wondering why a girl that likes you would kick you in the balls to show that she likes you. The $9 mark is basically the last hope. Unless you want to look to SPCE for your comparison (but that's just cherry picking charts to find one that helps you sleep at night; you know, standard practice for TA)

&#x200B;

Rocketman, Sir Big-balls Branson, SPCE:

[Expect more rockets](https://preview.redd.it/s8t2qm06sma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9ab72b20cd2f0662e9d3c64168c98454a63bc5)

I'm not convinced this chart belongs with the others, but I squinted really hard and kinda sorta see how it might fit the pattern. There is just so much extra going on with SPCE that it is not going to play nice for TA.

Is SPCE dead? Of course not. Branson survived, and that means SPCE is going to be just fine. Still, I think a retrace back to \~$40 looking for support would not be unwarranted.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. The U.S.S. Failboat**

This is by no means an exhaustive list of the failures, but RKT and WOOF stand out to me as examples of Team Fail.

First, the not-rocketman, RKT:

[This is not the way to the moon](https://preview.redd.it/kbsinyb3tma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=db532489fb141a71183654af327c744cb68851d8)

No matter how you redraw my breakout line, this is a clear fail. In fact, after the push up, the stock put in an all-time **low**. That is not how you get a lambo.

Is RKT dead? As a meme stock, yes. Dead and buried. As a long term investment? I could see the case for it, I guess...

&#x200B;

Unlike, WOOF, which is just hot garbage blended into your dog's food:

[Rocket ship to the Center of Earth. That's where the adventure is!](https://preview.redd.it/zw4u0u7mtma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce8e9394e6f4be03d1cfddee607d7de0bbb93cb7)

Can you even say this was *ever* a meme stock, proper? I don't think so. This is P&D action.

Is WOOF dead? In all ways, yes. Wasn't there a pet company during the dotcom bubble that went tits up....? Some lessons need to be learned twice it seems.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. The Week Ahead**

As I said at the beginning of Part 2, the State of the Meme is **wounded**. Last week's action was bad, across the board for everyone not in SPCE (or somehow, someway, for reasons I'll never understand, holding NEGG....). It's not over yet, though. Wounded is not dead. Hell, even dead can just be *mostly* dead. That's what the Princess Bride taught me, and I've learned everything I know from movies, so it must be true.

However, a stand **must** be made. A line in the sand **must** be drawn. Someone, somewhere, needs to stand up and say **enough is enough**. We are ~~human beings~~ *just oversized children* god-damnit!

If we have another week of across the board bleeding, shit has the potential to go south, and fast. On top of it, this coming week has a bunch of options expiring because monthlys. Expect maximum pressure. When you've got your opponent on his back foot, you don't let off, you hit harder. If they smell blood in the water--and the charts look to me like blood in the water--they are going to try to finish the job and obliterate the Defenders of Memelandia once and for all.

Do I honestly think the whole of ""the Suits"" is some cabal that would like to see this crazy ass party stop? No. I'm quite sure a bunch of them are on the long-side of these moves. They ***are*** the Options Wizards. But there are definitely some that want this boat roll over and if it looks like they can do it, then they go for it.

&#x200B;

**Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.**

7/12/21 00:41,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! Hey Guys,

Hope all of you had a blast on the 4th. Even though the market finished at new ATH this week, major US stock indexes fell by nearly 1% on Thursday before rebounding on Friday, recovering the previous day‚Äôs losses and then some. Also, given that we are entering earnings season, Wall Street is expecting the biggest quarterly earnings growth in a decade \[1\]. Overall, the discussion volume across social media was muted this week due to the dropping stock prices for the most popular stocks.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lopqx8zb7la71.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c63a005bfa54b2dfedcf94aca1d3346d6215244)

This unusual flip-flop of the market this week caused increasing chatter about SPY. This is the first time where SPY became the most discussed stock. GME, AMC, and WISH continue to be the top 3 discussed stocks with almost similar discussion volume. Newcomer‚Äôs to the list include Newegg following their 143% stock price rally last week and DiDi and Alibaba Group following the Chinese crackdown on tech companies.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/lctpkzbf7la71.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38b966eebc8a8dbee01c5ef5d4246f4e165653e

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Newegg Commerce($NEGG):** NEGG stock has more than doubled this week ending 143% higher than last week. While there is no concrete reason why NEGG was soaring, one catalyst was the availability of option-based trading that started in early July. But, retail investors are extremely skeptical regarding the current rise as reflected in the stock sentiment (-0.2%).

**Amazon($AMZN):** Amazon was trending due to its deal with Comcast. Under the deal, Amazon would now be able to offer recent live-action Universal movie releases. Adding to this, the speculations surrounding Bezo‚Äôs and Branson‚Äôs space race are also spilling over to the stock.

**DiDi Global($DIDI):** DIDI stock took a hard tumble following the Chinese crackdown on tech stocks. Beijing has now put DiDi under cybersecurity review and has also banned it from accepting new users. Adding to this, it has also directed app stores to stop offering DiDi‚Äôs app. The news also caused sell-off across Chinese tech stocks with Alibaba dropping 5% and NIO dropping 11%. According to a rough calculation from a new partnership formed by the Rhodium Group and the Atlantic Council, as much as $45 trillion in new capital flows into and out of China by 2030 would be stopped due to the rising regulations.

**Microsoft($MSFT):** MSFT was trending as the stock had a nice rally till Wednesday before dropping. Adding to this, the Department of Defense announced that it is killing off its controversial Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud-computing project. This was one of the military‚Äôs largest technology contracts ($10B) that MSFT won in 2019.

**Honorable Mentions:** Alibaba Group($BABA) chatter went up 60% following the Chinese crackdown on tech stocks and Boeing($BA) was trending (+67% chatter) following the willingness of Chinese aviation officials to conduct flight tests on Boeing Co's 737 MAX, potentially paving the way for the fastest-selling jet's return in China.

VIRT is classified as a Financial stock but I really think it's a tech stock. They basically pay a bunch of really smart developers, engineers and data scientists to design and run fully automated trading systems that provide liquidity across thousands of different stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities in hundreds of different marketplaces. As well as that, they offer a trading platform to businesses with sophisticated trading requirements (hedge funds, banks, airlines, energy utilities, commodity corps, etc) to execute and analyse trades.

Quoting from the most recent Quarterly https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Virtu-Financial-Inc-Earnings-Release-2021-Q1-(1).pdf (can't link because URL has brackets):

> The Company has two operating segments: Market Making and Execution Services

> Market Making principally consists of market making in the cash, futures and options markets across global equities, options, fixed income, currencies and commodities. As a market maker, the Company commits capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions.

Think of Market Making like the guy who punches your ticket when you go on a ride at the fair. Every time you want to go on the YOLOcoaster, if VIRT is doing a good job, they get to be the one to punch your ticket.

More and more types of market trading are impossible to profit from compared to 30 years ago when you could go long above some moving average and exit a week later for a nice profit. Market Making is one of the few profitable trading games left in town, and it has the nice property of making more money when markets are volatile or volumes are high. 

Buying VIRT gets you ownership in a successful business that makes money doing trading that is impossible for someone to do from their basement on Robinhood. VIRT has to compete for this against other market makers like Citadel or Susquehanna, but if they're good then make a tiny little bit of money in every trade they successfully compete on.

Hopefully lightbulbs are starting to go off. The more WSB and Robinhood and weekly YOLO options keep growing, the more opportunities for VIRT to compete and make tiny slices of money selling you AMC calls or whatever the next thing is. 

Aside from all the usual stuff they make markets in, there was also a recent announcement they are going to [partner with Pyth Network](https://ir.virtu.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Virtu-Financial-Joins-Pyth-Network-as-Newest-Partner/default.aspx) to start operating in cr*ptocurrencies as well. Now cr*pto markets are probably the least efficient in the world, so firms like VIRT can really make some hay while the sun is shining there.

> Execution  Services  comprises  agency-based  trading  and  trading  venues,  offering  execution  services  in  global  equities, options, futures and fixed income on behalf of institutions, banks and broker dealers. The Company also provides proprietary technology and infrastructure, workflow technology, and trading analytics services to select third parties. 

Market Making is definitely the biggest chunk of their earnings but Execution Services definitely seems like it's really growing, approaching 20% of total revenues and now over 20% of their ""Adjusted Net Trading Income"" (their preferred measure of earnings) and is a much more high margin business as well. 

This is the white glove part of their business, where some investment bank or whatever might not sneeze at paying millions of dollars to get some analytics on how their traders are executing on the NYSE,  or some endowments wants to get out of a big position in a dark liquidity pool without show volume on the exchange.

There are many other interesting use cases and tools of Execution Services listed [here](https://www.virtu.com/solutions/execution/).

A nice little side hustle for VIRT with big potential, because it has a much higher profit margin (80% of revenues go to into ANTI here) and much less competition. If they can grow this it'll be a big deal and I feel like right now the market trades VIRT as if it was just doing Market Making, so you are kind of getting Execution Services for free.

**Fundamentals**

I don't do my own fundamental analysis, but rather I get my numbers from [NewConstructs](https://www.newconstructs.com) who's analysts go through Annual and Quarterly reports and with the help of machine learning tools, make adjustments to generate more accurate fundamental numbers. If you have an Interactive Brokers account you can get the info for a particular stock by going to the ""News"" tab of the stock without needing a NewConstructs account. But I'm going to share some of their most recent analysis of VIRT below anyway.

Below information is from the *VIRT: Forensic Stock Earnings & Valuation* report released July 1 2021.

* Ranks in 98th percentile of 2800+ stocks covered
* Ranks 9th out of 427 financial sector stocks covered
* Their [economic EPS](https://www.newconstructs.com/education/education-close-the-loopholes/education-economic-earnings/) measure is $8.56 vs reported EPS of ~$6. So their analysts think that VIRT has even better earnings than GAAP earnings report.
* Their [economic book value per share](https://www.newconstructs.com/education-economic-book-value/) of ~$325. So you can pay $28 today for what their analysts view as worth $325.
* ROIC >50% vs WACC ~5%
* FCF yield near ~15%
* [Growth Appreciation Period](https://www.newconstructs.com/growth-appreciation-period/) <1 year - Quoting NewConstructs here
>at VIRT's current stock price the market is expecting almost no profit growth over the remainder of the company's life. As a result, expectations in VIRT's price are very conservative.
* Rated ""Very Attractive"", the [highest rating(https://www.newconstructs.com/stock-rating-methodology/).

All that to say, VIRT is a phenomenal business with megacap tech stock like ROIC and FCF values. And you can buy it today for less than a tenth of what it's worth.

The company is paying a decent dividend every year since listing and they've been using some profits to do buybacks since Nov 2020 of about $150 million. As of the most recent Quarterly, they still have $319 million (6% of the current market cap) available to keep doing buybacks until May 4 2022.

**Risks**

The price was recently trending up around $30 and got the big 10%+ smack down when Gary Gensler came out in June and [said he was reviewing payment for order flow a.k.a PFOF](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-sec-chairman-gary-gensler-speaks-with-cnbcs-the-exchange-today.html).

Now I think the market has this wrong. Because:

* Firstly, I don't think PFOF will go away. PFOF is how Robinhood and other brokers are offering commission free trading. If Gensler bans it, he would be smashing the business model that all the big brokers and Robinhood have adopted. Who's going to want to start paying commissions again after it was free?

* Secondly, even if PFOF goes away, what does that mean for VIRT? Market Making doesn't disappear, it's still essential. So they shed some costs by not having to pay to get the order flow and now it's just pure competition between them and other Market Makers for that business. Listen to the CEO on OddLots linked up the top and see how he talks about their competitive position.

Another major risk is that all markets globally go into a low volume, low volatility period because this is the least profitable environment for Market Making. But I think this risk is mitigated by the valuation. Even if there is a big decline in the business and everything is halved, their ROIC would be 25%, FCF yield 7%, economic book value $150.

7/11/21 03:48,"A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves. Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&format=png&auto=webp&s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&format=png&auto=webp&s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GME

&#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ga2p6b14xea71.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebef27e824a720d8c5230cf8af903a78aab51a38

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/nom6zafoxea71.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4005cf390fd6ac223164841a16f79694eed267b

&#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&format=png&auto=webp&s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&#x200B;

>...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

7/10/21 16:37,"AMC was delisted from threshold. Here's my Analysis of the threshold listing.  **- Dec Threshold Listing Timing of AMC and Prediction of Rising Timing after Threshold Listing in June AMC Based on Past Data -**

Closed days are not reflected in the calculation of business days!

**12/17\~12/28** Threshold Listed (**total 7** business days)

\-> Started rising on January 22 (**2.33 $** ), and highest on January 27 (**$ 20.36**).

This time ,

\-> After 25 days from 6/25 = **7/30** , After 18 days from 7/8 = **8/3** is.

The date calculation may have an error of several days, but the specific date is not important. From the end of July to the beginning of August, it can be expected that the increase will start.

7/10/21 07:34,"DD on BLDR! Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse! I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

7/9/21 23:11,"AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines), known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

To all the idiots saying this strategy does not work, here's AMC breaking 1 year deviation support (red line) of 43.65 support 2 days after my post, testing it three times. I could post charts of every other single stock following its deviation trend today, but instead of wasting my time I'll keep posting TA's for the retards that wanna hear my analysis. - AMC 1Day Chart -  [https://imgur.com/dO5vZVP](https://imgur.com/dO5vZVP)

8/15/21 15:02,"AMC - Quick technical and fundamental analysis for the next weeks What's up Apes,

Let's have a quick look at AMC and some possible scenarios for next week.

TLDR at the bottom.

The sell off has considerably slowed down in the last month, and the price has been mostly consolidating between 30 and 40 usd. Better than expected results for the third quarter, and some news announced in the earnings call on the 9th of august have led to a considerable price increase and gap up , which was quickly met with strong selling back down to support. From there, price has once again formed a double bottom and was mostly up in the following 4 or 5 trading days.

Overall, volatility and volume are down, which is good news for the bulls, because it indicates that the bears have lost some steam.

Let's have a look at the technicals.  


**Price Action**

Price is currently trading inside two wedge patterns, a small and a big one, indicated in the chart below with red and blue trend lines. If price breaks the upper red line, a rally and a test of the upper resistance of the big wedge (40usd) is likely. If it bounces off that resistance, I expect price to retest the lower red support again (30usd). A break and daily close above 40 would indicate forther upside (target 50 usd), while a break and daily close below would indicate further downside (target 25 usd)

**MACD**

The daily MACD has turned green for the first time since june. The moving averages are crossing. Overall the MACD suggest the momentum is shifting to the upside.

**RSI**

There is a bullish divergence in the RSI (Matching RSI lows while second price low was lower than the first), as well as a double bottom. Overall, the RSI indicates a decreasing bearish momentum and suggests that a (at least temporary) bottom might be in.

https://preview.redd.it/t6qpc4qofih71.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a43da79a122bfc655267ab28bb2ce7a7593b9f

**TLDR - Points of interest**

Long Positions: I am looking for an entry around 30 USD if price falls down there again. I am also looking for a break of the upper red resistance for a rally to 40. If 40 breaks, I am looking at 50.

Short Positions: I am looking at a bounce either off the upper red resistance back to 30, or if that resistance breaks, a bounce off the upper blue resistance back to either the upper red trendline, or if that breaks, 30 usd. However, bears should be careful. Price is down quite a lot, never chase.

I know GME AMC and CLOV are not the same and I am not here to bash either GME or AMC just pointing out some similarities between the three. I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. 

Looking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** 

The Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google

3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float 

The Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m

27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float 

The Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M

19m FTD‚Äôs / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!

Another thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. 

AMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 

CLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don‚Äôt really know but I hope so. 

**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** 

**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. Just pointing out some things I see from the Charts.** 

**I hope that everybody does they‚Äôre own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing.**

8/13/21 23:00,"Follow The Money II - Understanding Sectors And Adapting To Every Market Condition # I. Introduction

I think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches. By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**

If you [read my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1x0ls/follow_the_money_how_to_catch_every_rotation_and/), you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.

In this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**

To avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**

# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market

There is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.

Also, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**

# 1 - Energy (VDE)

**What It Is -**

""The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.""

\- *Investopedia*

Basically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.

**When It Outperforms -**

In most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.

""OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.""

*- Investopedia*

Basically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.

# 2 - Materials (VAW)

**What It Is -**

""The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,¬†and forestry products.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

The materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.

# 3 - Industrials (VIS)

**What It Is -**

""The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.""

\- *Investopedia*

Basically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.

**When It Outperforms -**

Because it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.

# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)

**What It Is -**

""Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.""¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

\- *Investopedia*

Essentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.

**When It Outperforms -**

Because it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.

# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)

**What It Is -**

""The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable‚Äîor unwilling‚Äîto cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.""¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

\- *Investopedia*

Basically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**

**When It Outperforms -**

These are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.

# 6 - Health Care (VHT)

**What It Is -**

""The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

This one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.

The drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.

# 7 - Financials (VFH)

**What It Is -**

""The financial sector is a section of the economy¬†made up of¬†firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This¬†sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

Banks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or ""spread"" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.

# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)

**What It Is -**

""The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.""

\- *Investopedia*

This one really needs no introduction.

**When It Outperforms -**

This is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.

# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)

**What It Is -**

""The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

This is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.

# 10 - Utilities (VPU)

**What It Is -**

""The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape‚Äîproviding as they do such staples for daily living‚Äîand are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

Yet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.

# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)

**What It Is -**

""Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made‚Äîincluding water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.""

*- Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

Like most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes.

# III. Practical Applications

To use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.

After identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.

You can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.

**Example -**

Last week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.

[VFH \(Financials\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/f8lboux5r5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d82ab4b17cc79ada84ec6e65473fd1eac870309)

I also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.

[BAC \(Financials\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/fjfynyv7r5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e0cb7ec1e5d05729cf3e41382c8591662a896e)

Lastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.

[ZB \(Bonds\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/6wwok3sbr5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=596609c73c6bbfdfc01392c6262a9bb8044cb204)

You don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.

# IV. Closing Thoughts

Let me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.

If you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.

# V. TL;DR

There's **11 sectors** within the stock market.

They are:

1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**
2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**
3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**
4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**
5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**
6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**
7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**
8. Information Technology **(VGT, Cyclical Most Of The Time)**
9. Communication Services **(VOX, Non-Cyclical)**
10. Utilities **(VPU, Non-Cyclical)**
11. Real Estate **(VNQ, Cyclical)**

Each one will be rotated into depending on different market conditions. Understanding this is important to being able to make money at any given time. I perform technical analysis to determine when each is being rotated into, but you can use any analysis you want.",52409,,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.99982518,True

8/10/21 22:03,"$OCGN for $62.3k - Waiting on WHO Approval for EUA Next Week &#x200B;

From the guy that sold his HIMX for a loss after the election, and his AMC 2.5c in January for 100$ profit, and lost *bigly* on vaccine manufacturers with call dates that expired early, I present my OCGN gamble.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/76zlipb6wkg71.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d30759b52df1947277c33c866f3a52a01e2c494

Ocugen bought the North American distribution rights to an Indian Vaccine - ""*Covaxin*"" made by Bharat Biotech.  It's a traditional vaccine in that it uses the tried and true whole-deactivated virus instead of the new mRNA technology and *Covaxin* has been [proven effective against the delta variant](https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/health/covid-19-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-works-against-delta-plus-variant-new-study-finds/2307143/).

I originally gambled on the stonks because they have emergency use authorization [(EUA) in 10 countries](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines/9/) (these 9 + Hungary) and thought the US FDA EUA approval would go... but no.  They were told no more EUAs being issued and go for full Biologics Application License.  Not gonna lie, that shit might take a year to get the full trials and paperwork vetted.  So, I've been bagholding the past couple months waiting on their other upcoming catalysts: Canadian EUA soon ^TM , the results of their 2-6 year old children's trial in September, AND the near (next week) WHO announcement on a EUA for the vaccine globally.

Its a gamble: WHO gives global approval to Bharat Biotech's *Coxavin,* that'll provide some serious legitimacy behind OCGN's Canadian EUA or even possibly lead to direct manufacturing for the global  COVAX distribution.  Coupled with the recent surge in Delta variant in the US, the FDA may even revisit an EUA for them...  but that's somewhere between maybe and using hopium as lube for a wishful gain-porn circle jerk.  It all comes down to WHO approval next week.

8/8/21 02:08,"How to use the $1T US Senate Infrastructure Bill to Place Bets this Fall and Get Rich w/ America Sup Retards

I am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the State Police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned, ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with a rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brother's insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.

In that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to ‚Äúlaunder‚Äù my brother‚Äôs $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That‚Äôs when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.

With our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.

In all sincerity, from what I‚Äôve read thus far, I‚Äôve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven‚Äôt read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an ‚Äúurban disaster,‚Äù and a ‚Äúcomplete shithole.‚Äù Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can‚Äôt read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.

I know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that‚Äôs not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there‚Äôs some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and ‚ÄúIndian Land‚Äù management. It so happens that a section of North America‚Äôs largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.

I‚Äôm not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE‚Äîin fact the last thing I want is Wallstreetbets gangingbanging CLNE again. You (we) people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and, even worse, after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.

**Infrastructure Bill** **& CLNE DD**

For those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *‚ÄúClean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*‚Äù They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comparable to diesel, and they also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles, buses, trucks, airplanes, spaceships, submarines, carbon neutral dollhouse electric generators, etc. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.

I don‚Äôt know what other retard‚Äôs High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn‚Äôt do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE ‚Äì that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal financial support is good for CLNE.

Overall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, tax incentives, support for labor. It‚Äôs unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.

Here are some highlights from the [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/06/clean-energy-fuels-corp-clne-q2-2021-earnings-call/) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.

* Increasing supply while in talks with ‚Äúdozens of dairies‚Äù sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.) 
* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.
* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today‚Äôs growing demand.
* Increasing customers in New York, Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and whatever state Amazon is.
* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.
* Electric 	and hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by 	infrastructure and mineral resources. Using the ""California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \[an 	example\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon reduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.""
* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.

Content pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:

&#x200B;

* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, 	methane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.
* Some related grants have requirements such as must be ‚Äúregionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable‚Äù which fits CLNE current business perfectly.
* ‚ÄúAppalachian regional energy hub initiative‚Äù  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to individuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and activities, that will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)
* $52,488,065,375 	through 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.
* Massive 	amounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The entire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially ‚ÄúSubtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,‚Äù as 	RNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it 	specifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it‚Äôs easy to see CLNE taking advantage.

Whether it‚Äôs intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair‚Äôs language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bill's language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.

**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**

I bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including my brother,  lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.

Instead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we‚Äôre the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son‚Äôs laptop?

As culturally enriching as the president‚Äôs son‚Äôs DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn‚Äôt want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.

The earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, ‚Äúexcluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.‚Äù

This is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he‚Äôs retarded, but because he‚Äôs a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don‚Äôt think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think it is just as likely California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair‚Äôs cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it‚Äôs consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without COVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it‚Äôs going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it‚Äôs bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end, it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy hoopla is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.

At 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don‚Äôt really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely to get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn‚Äôt really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.

I‚Äôm now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them into CLNE shares, every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it‚Äôs easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if I were to place a relatively placid bet.

TL;DR: you all are retarded but maybe not as retarded as me bc I‚Äôm bagholding CLNE. I combed through the infrastructure bill, looking for bullish indicators. I found a lot of implications for CLNE but lots of provisions that could affect many stocks in very specific ways.

The Infrastructure Bill is worth paying attention for gambling purposes.

8/7/21 21:24,"CNK- Huge opportunity in Cinemark 1.) When theaters go back to exclusive box office release instead of day and date streaming, movie theaters will skyrocket. On Sept 3rd, Shang Chi will be released exclusively to theaters and NOT Disney plus. Disney is losing significant amount of movie going direct to streaming and they know it. WB is going back to direct theater release at the end of 2021/early 2022. 

2.) Studios are creating movies with 200M+ budgets. Black Widow-200M, S. Squad-175M. The numbers don't make sense if they're NOT able to draw customers to the theaters due to PIRACY/Streaming. Scarlett Johansson/Paramount/Disney/WB know this is not sustainable. The exclusive theatrical window has been negotiated by WB to shrink from 90 to 45 days in Jan 2022.

3.) The ""variant"" and reopening sentiment derailed theater stocks like CINEMARK, IMAX, Marcus the last few months. Expect a mean reversion play once cases start to decline. (This is the time to buy not in a few months).

4.) CNK 1.8B market cap vs AMC 17B market cap. CNK can easily double.
 
Gross BOX OFFICE Revenues-
Jul21- 583M
Jul20- 8M
Jul19- 1.2B

Revenues are still down big from 2019 but nature is starting to heal giving you an opportunity to buy low before the crowd figures it out.

5.) You're buying for next year, not for TODAY'S numbers. 2021 is a transition year with the industry recovery kicking into gear in the second half of the year, which is loaded with blockbusters. 2022 will be close to back to normal with mega movies and giant franchisees fresh remakes and spin-offs that will have massive consumer appeal.

Expected Revenues for CNK. 

2019-3.2B, 2020-0.7B, 2021E-1.5B, 2022E-3B

6.) MANY movies were made for the big screen. It destroys the EXPERIENCE sitting on your couch constantly distracted by your phone. Drink at home or go out to a lounge/bar? It's the EXPERIENCE and that will never change.

7.) Liquidity- limited cash burn and secured a runway into 2022 if the current operating environment continues. Negotiated payment deferrals and modifications and across a wide range of lease related auto contractual obligations. $124 million CARES ACT received during 2020 and April 2021 with an incremental 30 million expected by your end. 

8.) Because of FUD and media hysteria over the variant, there is a significant discount to fair value from June. Patience required. Downside maybe to 14. Upside to 20-30+

**Edit 8/9 huge news**- 9.) AMC Entertainment has reached an agreement with Warner Bros. to showcase all of the studio‚Äôs 2022 slate in theaters for 45 days.

The world‚Äôs largest theater chain had balked at Warner Bros.‚Ä≤ decision to release this year‚Äôs films in cinemas and through its HBO Max streaming service on the same day.

AMC struck a similar contract with Comcast-owned Universal last year, which guaranteed theatrical exclusivity for at least 17 days before films could go to streaming or on-demand.

Warner Bros. had already announced that it would be returning to cinema-only releases in 2022 during its parent company AT&T‚Äôs earnings call last month. At that time it was unclear if the studio had signed deals with any theater chains.",52796,,,,,,,,,,negative,0.994815886,True
8/7/21 13:06,"Cinemark earnings call analysis ($CNK) **I read through the Cinemark ($CNK) earnings call and extracted what I thought were the most useful bits for not only Cinemark holders but also for anyone invested in $AMC, ¬£CINE (Cineworld) who both report this coming week.**

Link to full earnings call transcript: [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/06/cinemark-holdings-inc-cnk-q2-2021-earnings-call-tr/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/06/cinemark-holdings-inc-cnk-q2-2021-earnings-call-tr/)

# TLDR

**Cinemark Q2 earnings provided a useful insight into cinema attendance/streaming trends. It's not exactly an exciting equity story at the moment, more a case of survival until film slate improves and attendance gets closer to pre-pandemic levels. Mgmt said that company can survive till 2022 based on current liquidity position and monthly cash burn ($10-15m a month).**

# *Cash Burn / Liquidity stats*

*""During the quarter, our cash burn reduced to approximately* ***$25 million per month*** *after normalizing for working capital timing benefits and a $137 million tax refund, we received in April, which we discussed during our previous earnings call. This reduction in cash burn represents $25 million of improvement compared to the projection we provided in May, which was based on the operating environment at that moment in time.""*

***As of today, our average monthly cash burn has reduced even further to approximately $10 million to $15 million*** *including disbursements for capex, interest payments, and deferred rent and we expect that rate will continue to improve as our industry further rebounds. We ended the second quarter with a* ***global cash balance of $596 million and as of July 31st that balance had increased to approximately $610 million****.*

*This increase was driven by working capital benefits that were largely associated with the timing of July box office receipts relative to film rental payments. Based on our overall liquidity position and current cash burn rate, our* ***cash runway now extends well beyond the end of 2022****, again that projection does not include any further improvements in operating results nor does it include any additional financing options that remain available to us, such as drawing on our $100 million revolving credit line, tapping incremental term-loan borrowing capacity within our credit facility, executing sale leaseback arrangements on unencumbered properties we own or issuing equity.*

**Key takeaways:** 

a) Current monthly cash burn of $10-15m is nearly half what they predicted in May 2021

b) Cash runway extended to end of 2022..impressive.

# *CNK raised reasonably priced debt in the quarter and extended its debt maturity (positive)*

*During the quarter, we once again took advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced our $755 million senior notes that were coming due in 2023. In June, we issued $765 million of new senior notes due in 2028 with a* ***coupon of 5.25%, a very modest increase compared to the 4.73%*** *\[Phonetic\] of our 2023 notes. In conjunction with this deal,* ***we also added two years of maturity to our revolving credit line.*** *Following these transactions, our revolver maturity* ***now sits at November of 2024*** *and* ***all other significant maturities extend through March of 2025 and beyond****.* 

# *CNK is managing to increase ticket prices successfully*

*Admissions revenues were $140.6 million bolstered by an* ***all-time high average ticket price of $9.33.*** *Our* ***average ticket price was up 15% compared to 2Q 2019*** *primarily as a result of* ***pricing increases*** *and ticket tied mix that included a* ***higher rate of consumer upgrades to premium formats****, as well as* ***fewer matinee and weekday show times***

*We've also seen in the USA,* ***a huge uptick in our premium format consumption, which is up about 300 basis points*** *as a percent of total box office* ***even without availability of 3D content*** *compared to 2019*

# *People are spending more on Food and Beverages‚Ä¶*

*Domestic concession revenues were $99.4 million with another all-time high food and beverage per cap was $6.59. Our per cap grew 5% versus last quarter and 20% compared to 2Q 2019 as pent-up movie going demand continues to drive a heightened indulgence in food and beverage consumption across our core concession categories*

# *CNK generated positive EBITDA for first time since pandemic*

*‚Ä¶domestic operations generated positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time since the pandemic escalated last year*

# *International operation improving but not yet profitable on EBITDA basis*

*‚Ä¶we had reopened approximately 75% of our international theaters*

*second quarter attendance grew 60% versus 1Q 2021 to 4 million patrons, which drove $25.3 million of total international revenues.*

*Argentina, we have 100% of the theaters open with very little restrictions. Brazil, we have 95% of our theaters opened and again with only minimal restrictions*

*what the key thing here (International segment) will be, will be the continued vaccination, which we said is somewhere* ***between 30 and 90 days behind the US*** *and then continued positive cash flow along the way. The only country that's really not almost nearly opened up is Peru where we only have about 60% of that country opened up and there is still some restrictions relative to social distancing and percent of auditoriums that could be filled up.*

*International adjusted EBITDA was negative $12.3 million*

# *Hiring seems to be an issue, as it is for many US Corporations*

*We're certainly having (US Labor) pressures like I'd say the entire real estate segment is having with regard to what's going on with the workforce. Most of those pressures have been just on our recruiting effort,* ***which has become more cumbersome****, thus far we've been able to continue to get largely the workforce that we've been seeking and we* ***haven't seen a material impact on wage rates yet***

*One of the things that we're* ***fortunate about is we tend to have a younger, more seasonal workforce that hasn't been as affected by stimulus money****, these are* ***students in high school and college who are generally looking to work during the course of the summer and the holidays****, to be able to have money to take back to school, they like the flexibility of ours that we offer, and they like the perks being able to get free movies.*

# *CNK on Streaming / Disney+*

*Disney has come out as we expressed last time they had five pictures, we've released three of them those had an in-home premium access day-and-day,* ***but the next two Free Guy and Shang-Chi have 45 day exclusive windows.***

*So, Disney has been very clear that they've been testing and learning, they're trying to figure it out during this pandemic trying to offer optionality to consumers so that they can either see it in the home or in theaters particularly during this pandemic time and I think the thing that gives me solace on this is that* ***Bob Chapek, their CEO has been very direct, very clear that theatrical business was a $13 billion worldwide business for them that help set up franchise****, it helped eventisize movies and was very important in their ecosystem.*

# *CNK on Delta Variant/lockdowns*

*But here's what I think is the key thing, when the whole COVID crisis began we responded very, very quickly and I think led the industry with the Cinemark standard and we came out with a whole set of protocols based on the data that was coming out of the CDC.*

*And then, when the CDC made their adaptation and said the most important thing is air quality,* ***we pivoted literally almost immediately, we converted all of our theaters to MERV 13 air filtration****, on the HVAC system,* ***we increased the fresh air coming from the outside as much as a 100% to 300%.*** ***So we're very nimble at being able to adapt and change on this and we've been doing it now for 16-17 months, our theater teams are very adapted there****, so we're ready to go if and when we have to make further adaptations*

# *CNK - Attendance comparisons vs 2019*

***Analyst Q (Jim Goss):*** *‚ÄúThe run rate for the second quarter domestic admissions and concessions was roughly* ***35% of 2019 level to look at it that way****, if that's sort of a normalized year. I'm wondering even with the film slate you have for the third and fourth quarter,* ***what you think might be acceptable minimum targets for Q3 and Q4 in that regard****, do you think there is a chance to get back to 100% or would it be more like an 80% or 85% by the fourth quarter and how would it flow into it, because it seems like there has been a little bit more of a lag getting into the bigger numbers even though obviously did very well in the second quarter‚Ä¶‚Äù*

**CNK CEO:** *‚Äú‚Ä¶Look, we think that the box office is going to recover beginning. It's actually obviously began in the second quarter, it's going to further in the third quarter, the fourth quarter as I indicated the line of films is outstanding and I didn't even go into the lineup for 2022. We've done that before, but I mean it is really outstanding. Now the question is, is the box office is going to recover 100% or 90% or 85%, I think that very hard to predict and guess against. But I would put it this way, we are very, very well positioned to be able to adapt to that to make sure that our profitability returns to a level that is acceptable to us and to our investors and we're just going to have to see, I mean, we don't know is the box office going to return to a 90% level or an 85% level.*

# *On Piracy threat for Streamers‚Ä¶*

*And so, the issue now is as if a movie has a potential to be in the home day and date, then* ***a digital copy is going into that home and potentially increase in the level of piracy, because now you're introducing a new place to be able to pirated from and I think all of the studios are obviously very concerned about this*** *and doing everything they possibly can to reduce that and then also running their own numbers in considering what the negative impact is not only on their business of the studios business, but it also clearly affects the partnership with us because we're doing everything I can, do everything we can to reduce piracy and if its introduced in the home, then that's starting to affect our business as well. We haven't been able to come up with a hard and fast number to put against that, it's clearly important and something that is industrywide issue for not only exhibition, but also the content providers.*

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

*Okay.* ***Yes, because it's a perfect copy basically available easily they don't even need to sneak in to do anything like that****. And it does come out of your aftermarket, your first run market as well.*

**\*CNK on the film slate this year and upcoming film slate\***

*Well, first of all, I think given the circumstances of the industry and the COVID variant and all the publicity associated with that, I think that* ***opening up a movies like Black Widow to $80 million is a very, very successful, the run for Fast and Furious and again extremely successful, A Quiet Place Part II, I think that movie opened strong and continued to play and play and play****. So we've got to take it in the context of the environment in which we're acting in and look there is no secret that Cinemark feels very strongly that we would like an exclusive window and we're willing to adjust what had been the traditional exclusive window, because we think it's good for our business and truly we think it's good for the entire business because we think it allows studios to then window their revenue and allows consumers to actually purchase the same exact content in multiple formats, which benefits the content owners. So look, we're in a very fluid environment it's hard to say this movie was successful and that one wasn't.*

*But when you look at these past films that we've had, I'm pretty darn encouraged on what's going to happen.* ***I'm also excited to see the third and especially the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter with movies like Bond coming and Dune coming and of course Top Gun coming and many of the others I mentioned, I think that we're in for a very significant recovery from the fourth quarter, which is going to lead in to that 2022****. So, I can't be put in a position of nor can Sean of trying to predict, but I would say relative to the movies that I indicated we're satisfied, we think that we can actually continue to do better as the COVID threat becomes less and less and we think we can do better with an exclusive window, then we're going to have a day and date arrangement.*

# *CNK on Movie-club goers*

*Nearly 20% of our business during the second quarter was coming from Movie-Club members. So that's obviously one of the reasons we want to do it. It just further communication with them, they tend to be the* ***most frequent goers and they also tend to be very high food and beverage purchasers.***",52811,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.999607623,True

8/6/21 00:26,"July FTD chart on meme. LMK if you guys want to include other tickers So I have wrote a simple program to automatically generate this Fails-To-Deliver chart (semi-automatic).

Picked top three hot tickers. It is crazy to see so many shares were failed to deliver while the price kept falling down.

[Fails-To-Deliver chart](https://preview.redd.it/ejttb15exlf71.png?width=2028&format=png&auto=webp&s=526dd35761eaff5597633a7022cfd49932bf4b82)

The natural of FTD is: ""Fails to deliver on a given day are a cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day. The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. **If all shares were delivered on a particular day, then there will be no entry in the table**""

If this is the case, when the FTD number falls usually means the the same amount of shares have been bought to cover which should technically cause the share price increase. But the chart suggests otherwise.

In 2021-07-06, nearly 2M of AMC FTD are covered, but stock price fell \~$3.

In 2021-07-13, over 11M of CLOV FTD are covered, but stock price stay flat.

Is it self sabotage? 

I‚Äôve done it with AMC, HOOD and CLOV 

I held amc and took a 10% gain before it popped

I bought hood at 35.5 because I thought it would have a pop (sold at 37)

CLOV I bought at 10 and sold at 11.6 (I now own more at 8 and will hold for this one). 

Is there anyone else that does this kinda retard behaviour? 

Is it because I hate myself or what? I need genuine guidance",52978,,,,,,,,,,positive,0.995624125,True

But don't sleep on the Lidar Train. If papa ackman already reverse doggied your portfolio and your wife's boyfriend is about to go all in on spy calls because he's a fucking genius, then fuck em.
You are too. You just read this.
Buy VlDR. See you on the moon.

Here we'll do a quick update on AMC.

&#x200B;

In my first post 2 months ago I said to look for AMC rejecting off the 60 level. And then I said; 

 

>Using the basic rules covered so far, this would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

And then in my second post I said at this part of the move;

I thought we'd be here in the downtrend.

&#x200B;

Updated trade plan - Target for next downswing is 17.50.   Probably see some bullish momentum from there.  Will probably look for short entries again around 50 if we do.
